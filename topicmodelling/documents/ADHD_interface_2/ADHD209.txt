Suggestions for reading my parents can do to understand adult ADHD? I'm an adult (22F) who was diagnosed six months ago and just moved back home with my mother. Because my diagnosis is still fresh, and I pursued it on my own, my mother's understanding of ADHD (PI) is limited. She's very sympathetic, but definitely doesn't understand the less obvious ways it impacts my life. She asked if I knew of any articles/websites/books that had information about adult ADHD, and I realized I didn't really, so I thought I'd bring the question to all of you. 

She understands it mostly as a learning disability, but not really how it impacts my day-to-day difficulties, like household chores etc., as well as my mood, so it would be really helpful to find information about that. Thank you for any help & suggestions!

Watching Russel Barkley on YouTube is also amazing (but I recommend that you watch the video with a supportive friend or alone before sharing it. There is a lot of information to process). http://adhdlectures.com is very in depth. Also by Russell Barkley For a book, see Barkley’s “Taking Charge of Adult ADHD.” It has a very good overview. Also, the way it’s broken into sections on work, money, relationships, etc., it’s really easy to see all the different ways ADHD affects day to day life, that aren’t apparent to others.
