100+ browser tabs open and counting, skim reading each page for about 5 seconds only to realize your mind was on something else and re-read again, as another idea pops up open another tab to look it up. Why do I have 100+ tabs? 

- Attention span is about 10 seconds max.
- Even when I try to read, my mind is sometimes on another train of thought; as I finish the paragraph I try to bring it back to the actual reading 
- so I need to read it AGAIN until the words make sense.
- before I finish anything, at least 4 new trains of thought would come to mind within 1 minute.
- I open new tabs to look into those ideas.
- ...and when I open another new tab, I forgot what I opened the tab for.
 See a word, open a new tab to research it, fly down a never-ending tunnel of links to even more interesting things until the original page is an ancient memory and ten new tabs have spawned. Repeat ad nauseam for all new tabs until exhausted, hungry and don't know what time it is. Etc.

Sometimes I bookmark things because it makes me feel like I can let it go without wasting time on it now. The result is thousands of random bookmarks that I never EVER look at.

The internet can be a terrible thing for people with impulse issues. I have 265 open tabs so I understand. I usually delete all but about 50 every 3-4 weeks.  I'd really like to see the questionnaires that are used to diagnose ADHD/ADD to take into account our continuing ly toxic relationships with the internet. Like amount of time spent gaming per day, non specific surfing, and how many tabs open. How often have you burnt food while surfing?, how often have you made poor nutrition choices to keep your internet running? This is the running joke with my friends...”How many tabs do you have open today, WideOut86?” 
The way my brain works though, it’s comforting. Phone and laptop are both always littered with organized tabs. I know mostly what’s there.  you aren't alone. 100+ tabs open on my browser and 100+ tabs open in my brain. All day, every day.  Face this problem all the time How does everyone here have 100+ tabs? I have like 30 chrome tabs open and my 8GB ram can barely handle that.  I love research! Doing anything with it? Im just that dude in a convo awkwardly waiting to throw a fact down. Hit and miss strategy but im intrested :) > Sometimes I bookmark things because it makes me feel like I can let it go without wasting time on it now.

Id laugh at how accurate all of these are if it wasnt so infuriating This is exactly my technique...although I also made my own custom browser plugin to organize/stash them in a way that made the most sense for me :)  Then I switched to a new browser that uses less memory...so back to 100\-600 tabs (I'm trying to be better, but I've gotten past the 600 mark in the past)

A couple "rules" I added for organization and discipline:

Each new topic gets a new window \- the one at the far left is the beginning of the chain\-well at least usually, sometimes click\-holes change the meaning...then I either cringe and close the window or close the tabs one by one, reading any I'm likely to read as I go.

For a quick fact check or definition of something, I also open a new window, but then close it before going back to the previous window (since they're not research themselves I try to resist or complete any holes I fall down).

If I can't figure out which window the topic I want to return to is in, I start doing cleanup How do you check how many tabs you have open? I probably have over 300 but only the first 100 or so show up.  

Edit: Found it! Ctrl + Alt + Del for any other Windows users wondering.
