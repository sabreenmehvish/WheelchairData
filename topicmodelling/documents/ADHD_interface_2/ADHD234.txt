Any tips to help with reading? Even going through these posts if it's longer than a paragraph or two I'll usually just skip to the comments and then it those are too long I'll exit the post entirely. 

I've always found it difficult to stay interested in reading something and I haven't even read a book since I was in school (now 30) and the last time I tried I made it through about 3 pages. I think it comes down to just instantly forgetting what I read by the time I read the end of the sentence.

Just wondering if there are any tips or ways people have managed to help with this. [deleted] I feel ya. Reading sucks - unless I'm reading something else to avoid reading what I'm *supposed* to be reading, in which case I can become very engrossed. 

I find the pomodoro technique useful. If you're not familiar it's posted all over this sub, but the premise is set a timer for about 25 min and take breaks after that. The intervals can obviously be adjusted, but I find that having a definitive end to the reading session helps my brain be able to tackle just a few pages at a time without feeling like I have to digest a whole book. Plus the "deadline" factor helps and I can actually get a flow going without having to stop/re-read as much.  [deleted] I used to be a big reader, but I had to reread a lot to cement what was happening into my memory and I liked to stop and imagine how things might go differently (or Mary Sue myself in to fix everything). So I'm a slow reader.

Then the internet came and reading gets harder because I can get so much stimulus so much faster.

Sometimes I add unnecessary paragraph breaks to my own comments just to make it easier on my eyes. I've completely switched to audiobooks. Which has also helped with motivation for other tasks as well. Knowing that I have a book to listen to helps a lot when I need to do things I don't want to do like cleaning, doing the dishes, or taking a shower. 

Also, when I see a huge wall of text online I use a text to speech website so I can listen to it!  Maybe follow along with an audiobook, and after each chapter or reading session, write down a thought or two about what you just read. You could summarize only, or write about something that caught your attention or what you liked or disliked about what you read. Being an active reader helps to remember what youâ€™ve read more.
