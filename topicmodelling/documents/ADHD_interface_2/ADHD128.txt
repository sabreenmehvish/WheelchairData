ADD people: Take as long as you need on homework. As long as the time allows you of course.

(Currently not on my meds)  I just spent 3 days looking for the answer to a chemistry problem I'm really struggling with and thank god I did because now I totally understand what I've been missing.  I just know that if I had asked anyone else who doesn't have ADD for advice they would have just told me to push forward and not waste any time by backtracking so far.  I had to go back several chapters and I really didn't want to - but I figured since I have 2 more weeks to finish the questions it wouldn't be a waste of time and it really wasn't.

Good luck unmedicated students. Get back to work! x) I totally hear that. I can’t memorize things w/o understanding them, and sometimes the longer it takes for me to figure it out, the better I remember.  Damnit, are you my alt account? 😝 Even medicated I'm like that, but I tend to understand things a lot quicker. Like I solved a couple month long problems @ work my first week medicated. This was me with chem today. My tutor: “just memorize the formula.” Me: “how the hell am I supposed to do that if I don’t understand what these numbers are doing?” Haha, I definitely think so. 

That’s exciting! It must be cool to “think quicker.” Medication definitely helps me understand things quicker, I wouldn’t need to review past chapters anymore to remember stuff! It’s gonna be another year I think before I can take meds again so I must be slow and steady for the moment :’(  So true! And for the people who do just memorize the formula- how can they apply it later on to more difficult stuff if they don't understand it? "Just memorize" is nuts. Well more like I can see a few steps ahead instead of needing to try a bunch of different methods to see if one works.

And one of the tasks was reading comprehension related and meds definitely improve my reading
