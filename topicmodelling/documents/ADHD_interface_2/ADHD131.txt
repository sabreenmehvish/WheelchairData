Anyone here actually made use of the random stuff you get interested in for like a few hours once a month? Aka "Everything is so cool" syndrome just spent the last hour learning about information security instead of like, sleeping. Before that was different engine layouts in early roadsters. Before that it was kind of this trip through listeria to astrobiology into planned future space missions.

Now the things I mentioned above are all stuff I've looked into before - but yeah, not about to switch careers to any of them, or dedicate more time than I happen to feel like at the moment to making the next step.

**Just kind of tired of being the 'jack of all trades'** and knowing the first thing about everything but the second thing about almost nothing. The second I see a string of acronyms I don't know or a scary formula or something I instantly lose interest and it suddenly makes no sense to force myself to learn about something I no longer care about. Until the next time the planets align or whatever and I'm dying to know all about the influence of menstruation on the evolution of culture.

**I have a cool wikipedia article for every social situation and am probably 3% more capable in 1% more situations but those're really the only benefits I've gleaned.**

**How did you actually make something worthwhile come out of this?** Urgh I feel the same way I also have the "this is my new hobby and I'm going to invest money and time into for a week before I get bored and never do it again" It's made me a fucking beast at pub quizzes  Kind of. Getting into a hobby usually results in a load of wasted money on something I never look twice at. However I have so far managed to build my career around the "oooh look that's interesting" side of ADHD. When I was 23 I started a 1st line support job in broadband. Every 2 years or so I've seen something related to move my career into so I can learn something new. I'm now 31 and working as a network security consultant (around the IS you mentioned earlier). I think I've had at least 5 job moves based on someone else's job looking more interesting than mine. I've probably been lucky that I've managed not to make myself unemployable by doing this. [deleted] Personally I think reading a little bit about everything helps to start conversations at the very least.  Eventually you'll meet someone who DOES know the second thing about something you looked into, and you'll be able to say "Oh yeah, I read about this but didn't understand X" and then boom, instant interesting conversation.  

I'm not sure how old you are, but if you're in the younger age range you may enjoy reading "The day I became an autodidact" - I really enjoyed it when I was younger.  

Reading about tons of different subjects is the ONLY way you'll eventually find your passion.  And you will find your passion.  It may take time, and it will be hard, and it won't be instant gratification.  But it might be close enough to instant gratification.  For me, it was chemistry.  For you, it might be tattooing or biology or aeronautical engineering or mid-century modern design - but reading about different topics will help you find out what you love. 
 Seeing posts like this makes me sorta glad I haven't yet invested in a $200 mechanical keyboard that I SOSoSO NEED. Or a $100 x200 to use Linux on. Cause I already have a laptop ButWouldntItBeCoolToGetTheOneEveryoneLovesOnline?! I have to be very careful about not spending a ton of money on any of my new hobbies. It's kind of sad that sometimes my kids will refer to certain times over the years in terms of what hobby I was caught up in. "oh, was that during your quilting phase?"

I've learned a lot about a wide variety of things over the years due to my streaks and have also learned to limit myself with the buying. Sometimes I'll see a cool project on Pinterest and it's really tempting to buy enough supplies to make 100 of them. "I can sell them, give them as gifts, blah, blah, blah" Now I remind myself to buy enough for ONE and I can always go back to get more supplies later.

This is one of the reasons I thought I was a hoarder for a while. bought WAY too many things impulsively then, on top of that, had a really hard time initiating any decluttering efforts. Bad combo :(
I recommend the Kon Mari method for anyone else with the same issue. It was very enlightening to me to see everything all grouped up and not hiding behind closet doors.

The times when this tendency has actually been helpful are when I'm completely diving into something like an advocacy project. It's like I'm a bloodhound and can stay on the trail gathering an immense amount of information. Of course the downside is that my house turns into a pit and my kids are eating cereal for every meal. I try to avoid getting involved in  "projects" that don't have a definite end that is in the near future because I will either burn out on it before it's completed or I'll allow it to consume me. 10 months ago I tried teaching myself to crochet. I figured it wouldn't be long until I gave up and/or moved onto something else. Yeah, I got addicted and now I make intricate lacey pieces with thread and a 1.5 mm hook. I really didn't see it coming. 

I do tend to not finish crochet projects if they're too long or boring though. I generally stick to smaller pieces or ones that give me the feeling of completion in increments so I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I made a 3 project rule. I'm not allowed to have more than 3 projects going. To start a new one, I need to finish one. That rule has tested my self discipline a few times. I'm also now dying to about the influence of menstruation on the evolution of culture. Damn it. I can play a 20 second thing on the guitar that sounds pretty good. Over the years a few things have stuck - well, probably not like they would for a neuro-normative, but there are certainly things I come back to again and again over the years and have therefore achieved some level of competence/expertise in.  

As for career - well, I've finally learnt to embrace the evolving career.  I'm self-employed, and it means that I can mitigate the negative effects of losing interest by
1) always working in more than one profession or area at once, meaning boredom comes slower 
2) overlapping jobs/areas, so that I'm still earning enough from the old one to tide me over whilst beginning the new one, and so on 
3) meaning that I'm not dependent on employers putting up with me!  

And as for the random spending 10 hours finding out about something I really don't need to know - well, I'm forever being asked "how on earth do you know all that?", and I rarely admit that it's due to time-down-a-rabbit-hole rather than a good memory and general knowledge.  

It doesn't stop getting frustrating, but not only do you learn to manage yourself better over time, but also you learn to design your life in a way that makes the best of things.  Still hate having ADHD, but things are way easier than they were, and (albeit with a bumpy trajectory), they get better over time.   While I've definitely rode the train out to randomville (hence why I know certain medications can cause a rash that can develop into the fatal situation where the top layer of your epidermis detaches everywhere), I do have some focus in some of my hobbies.

I have been really into personality typing in the past -- that has sucked up more hours than I really want to talk about, though it does give me language for describing how people can be different from each other. For what it is worth, as someone who can say maybe the 82nd thing about personality typing, if it is in an area that either you don't want to make a career out of, or others don't value, (or in my case, both,) it still kind of sucks :/

Thankfully, my interest settled on ADHD more recently, and I've been researching it on and off for the last few months. So that has some splash-over benefit in that I know more things about ADHD, and I can say those things at other people. Of course, what with the whole performance disorder aspect, those things haven't all translated into action... But I at least know what options are out there? Learned touch typing and converted to the Dvorak keyboard layout, which is fun, because whenever someone tries to use my computer, the letters that appear on the screen don't match the letters on the keyboard, and people tend to freak out about that.

Learned tons about Linux and the various distributions. But this is something I'll never use in my career, and after several years, I'm only rarely using it at home.

These are things I "made use of." But I would not say that the use has outweighed the time invested to learn them. (It's hard to say with Dvorak though. I used to get repetitive stress syndrome from typing, and that's no longer a problem, so maybe it was worth the distraction, but I doubt it.) I recently bought a kayak after an evening of obsessively watching kayaking videos on youtube. I've only gone once in the few months I've had it. I've been sticking with fountain pens and pretty paper for a while after "IT'S SO COOL" hit me. Paper and pen is really conducive to my ADHD brain... Have a side thought? Write it. Cool. Can't remember your shopping list? It's already in your pocket. I've made my notebook and a pen as much a part of my EDC as wallet, keys, and phone.  My professional life has been based on knowing a lot of obscure stuff that I can pull out at the right moment, and being able to quickly look up and find good sources for stuff no one else at work can find.  I used to work hospitality management, and knowing random facts to answer guests questions was huge, as well as having a vague working knowledge of, say, refrigeration technology, was a lifesaver when the walk-in cooler has shut down at 2am and a 24 hr call out to the technician might cost upwards of $1,000, vs the cost of all the food in the cooler spoiling and having to be thrown out.  This happened several times and yet I was still the only fucking person on staff who knew where to look for the stupid breaker box for the cooler.  

Now I do sales and non-technical research for an engineering firm.  I tend to read whatever comes my way and follow threads of thought where ever they go, because I really don't know what will come in handy, so the 2 weeks I spent this last winter skimming through the council meeting minutes posted online by various local municipalities means that I know what large construction projects they are planning in the next 5 years that will need engineering services, and that I have one foot in the door for getting those jobs.  I not only know what they are planning, but also where they are in their timelines. 

My boss was super impressed when I casually mentioned last week that one RM is trying to take out a million dollar loan for a new wastewater lagoon and our main competition did the initial engineering study so is not legally allowed to be the one doing the detailed engineering study.  

I have to be careful to stay within some parameters when wandering around online at work, but my bosses tend to realize quickly that all the weird stuff I'm reading at work instead of, say, typing a report, will eventually come in handy at a critical time, so they are pretty patient with it.  

I'm also the Google Elf for much of my workplace now.  They figured out quickly that I can find in about 5 minutes what they've been looking for 2 weeks for, even if I know absolutely nothing about the topic and they are experts, just because I know how to refine my search so much better than most people.

But, I do force myself to read through the acronyms (in fact, acronyms are usually the first thing I google because there are so many, so many are the same letters, and I get asked by my boss at least twice a day "what the hell does that stand for". In my current job, I work with on a lot of very large construction projects and every single company, gov't department and the thousands of various tests involved have their own acronym and are used liberally throughout the 200+page documents that I have to skim through daily to pull out the one or two items that actually relate to what my company is doing on the project.  But again, the acronym obsession came about after being asked hundreds of times what that acronym means.

tl;dr: you never know what will come in handy, so don't beat yourself up, just focus on improving you time management and impulse control, the random facts will, eventually, come in handy. I turned that random thing into my degree at university. Now I'm going to have a degree in Pharmacology and don't know what I'm gonna do with it.  I love having a long list of hobbies. They're great ice breakers when I meet new people, although some people get intimidated because they equate having lots of hobbies with being really talented (I just have a lot of free time tbh). The downside of having lots of hobbies in my opinion is definitely the startup cost of each new thing I take up.

Since I love learning and researching, I've been told that I can carry a conversation about anything and I like that strangers find me interesting. I've been waitressing part time and it's fun for me to try and find a way to connect with my customers, whether it's about their first language or me going off on a tangent about how you can rent castles on AirBnB (they were still talking about it after I left their table). Looking up obscure facts on Wikipedia is paying off, I guess. 

I'm somewhat the opposite of you though since I find acronyms and long words during my research intriguing and start diving even deeper to find out every last little thing, especially when I'm hyperfocused. I don't find all this extra knowledge to be "useless".

For instance, I changed my university program 6 times before dropping out twice. Learning about machine language, computer memory, and functions during my spree in CompSci allowed me to better visualize how we acquire languages in my psycholinguistics classes since computers and human brains are pretty similar. Learning French for fun comes in pretty handy sometimes even though I'm only certified at A1 (like the other day, I realized that captains calling "Mayday" are perhaps actually saying "m'aidez", as in "help me" but I've yet to Google and confirm this). I use what I learned from my Kinesiology and Nutrition classes almost every day and when I took Biology last year, I was way ahead of my class already.

I've been coding and programming since I was 8 years old and I'm entirely self-taught. Because of how I've dabbled in web design and programming for the last 14 years, I was able to land myself a full time job as a web developer without a degree or diploma. The fact that I'm adaptable and a Jill of all trades really sealed the deal for the CEO of the company who hired me.

**TL;DR:** Gaining knowledge is never a waste of time in my opinion. It's opened a lot of doors for me and I use the facts and skills I've acquired from my hobbies and hyperfocus sessions every single day. Got randomly super into the idea of fishing last week. Yesterday I went to a tackle shop, bought a pole/tackle, and had a fantastic relaxing day at the pier. Some great alone time and something I hope to do again. ~$60 for one of the most relaxing and self soothing days I've had recently was well worth it. I am very, VERY good at trivia games.

Just played one last night - unfortunately, everyone gave up after a single round because I dominated so hard. I had twice as many points as the second place winner. :( Okay, so nothing majorly worthwhile, but several things recently:

I got distracted procrastinating making a scientific poster, and someone on twitter was talking about "semi-permanent" tattoos. So I looked them up. Turns out that semi-permanent tattoos don't exist. The closest thing is henna, which lasts max 2-3 weeks. But there was research a while ago into microencapsulation of tattoo ink! I don't know where the research is at now, but they were looking at putting biodegradable ink inside microbeads. The microbeads would burst when hit with a very specific laser wavelength, then the body would clean up the ink - so the tattoo would be permanent, but much easier to remove than the current tattoos! 

Procrastinating again during election week (Australian), I used Excel to pull data from the Australian Electoral Commission website, and calculate certain percentages that would tell me the progress of each electorate at counting their polling place votes. It was kinda interesting! but also really useless and not interesting at all haha. Cars and paintball. Got into them and they stuck I like that i’m the jack of all trades in my group. I get to experience new things and expand my horizons. I do make sure to stick with something for a certain amount of time. I am currently doing piano lessons. Before I move on to the next thing I plan to finish book five. There’s so much I want to do and several more instruments I want to learn as well as languages.  This is how I am with my video games. I will play a certain game for a month before switching to a different one for a month.  I play the same games 5 games.  me_irl I retain a lot of what I read and enjoy learning and sharing what I know with others when appropriate. I've been told it makes me an interesting person and since many people know I have so much random stuff in my brain they ask me random questions a lot. So it's actually been useful and helps me bond with people.  I base my career in IT in the fact that I know a little bit of everything, a reason amount of quite some things and a lot about few. I tend to geek out on technology; I work in technology. So it kind of works out.  My family and I watch Jeopardy every night.  My mom is always baffled at the random shit I know, and yet most of it just comes from video games I get into and various wikipedia articles I end up focusing on for hours...

Besides potentially going on a nationwide quiz show though, my various fun facts have no real use :P it sucks. I have been that way for way too long it's annoying good thing I have a girlfriend that knows me and knows I wouldn't finish my hobby she let's me only buy like  a small starter kit then I do my thing for a while. Yes, and I didn't realize that was a symptom of ADHD until a little while ago. 3 months ago, I thought I was going to go into web development to pay my way through art school. I think I made one or two reddit posts asking people about it. And I attended a WOIA to see if I could use the grant get a web development certificate. Then, I decided I didn't care enough to do it professionally.

The only thing that's really stuck is drawing/design, but even then, I'll get an idea for a story, spend months planning it, get a new idea, and lose interest in the first one.  I can totally relate. But having hobbies even if they last for only a few weeks is what keeps me sane and helps prevent me entering into a depression. So I've made my peace with it. It keeps me motivated. That gives me some sense of looking forward to something and **focusing** on something. Some good Jack Of All Trades jobs out there... 

Doctor/Nurse, Engineer, FullStackDev, ScrumMaster, Journalist (what's the new name for this), Mgmt Consultant. #*Everything is awesome*

*[Links to youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DWB7CBdvXU)* I'm always intermittently fascinated with mechanics and biomechanics.  I'm currently a product development engineer at an orthopedic implant company.  Still fun, but I don't wind up on as many tangents online anymore because there are so many cool videos to watch on the company interweb.  Woot!

And the company interweb has much better resources into my nerdiness on this topic anyways, so it motivates me to work hard through my bored times to keep my access to my nerd readings. So I've always loved beer and making beer at home. But a lot of times my beer sucked because I would ignore it after the brew day. Either I got bored and started cutting corners and risking bad beer or just forgot about it for 6 months (and beers like pale ales or IPAs do not taste good stale and aged). I had tons of book knowledge from reading and practice brewing but never took care of my stuff. I had to throw out gear because I let  it sit wet for days and mold grew on it. 

I was basically wasting time and money on a hobby I loved but wasn't able to focus on. Medication and CBT have helped immensely. I'm making brewery quality beer on a regular basis because I am staying  on task and not taking shortcuts. 

Do I still go on deep dives? All the time. Especially when it's late, my meds are worn off, and there's a great innawoods thread on /x/. But I've come o learn the difference between passing interests and hobbies I legitimately find worthwhile and rewarding (lifting, brewing, gardening, history).  I like being a jack of all trades but I try to pick up things that will better myself and make money or cost very little.  People enjoy talking to me because I have a ton of random knowledge and experiences. I've picked up everything from guitar to knitting AND crocheting, reading an intensive book about Columbine and doing tons of research about the author bc I loved his writing, laminating things at home, made kid a detailed potty chart that's collecting dust under my printer...

Perhaps the worst of these is my ability to make myself an expert in any illness I MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE of having. I cannot stop myself from reading reading reading about WHY my eyesight is abnormally terrible, etc... Family says I'm fine but that's of course extremely off putting and since I've got immature "wiring" in my brain I am instantly convinced I have mystery illness if they're saying I don't have it.  I really love and embrace this as part of my personality because it helps me rule out things that I don't like and helps me discover things I would have likely not done if I didn't have a new hobby every month.  Oh god I know. And then there's the next step "I've learned from experience that putting money into this is probably a bad idea so I'm just going to have no hobbies that need equipment and probably miss out on a lot of good stuff" I call it the Wall of Apathy. Once I realize that I am likely to fail at the hobby for whatever reason (money, time, age, skill set, etc.) I lose interest immediately and completely, to the extent that I don't even want to think about it. It really sucks if I hit that wall after investing resources into it. Would you consider trivia a hobby? Your comment is making me consider that to be the case... Same here. I was in a pub quiz and the question was "Who was the female opera singer Freddie Mercury performed with?" Not exactly difficult but if you aren't a Queen or opera fan then you probably wouldn't know.

Montserrat Caballe. Nobody else knew that. They all looked at me like I was a complete nerd. Oh yes. I have always been good at trivia games. Before the internet, I would compulsively look up things in my family's encyclopedia Britannica. I could spend hours reading random topics. I would also walk to the library and browse shelves for interesting topics, read a few pages or a chapter, get bored and move on. 

In middle school, I did really well in "quiz bowl" which was a competitive trivia competition. Also, sometimes I tell myself that the best moments of my life were during 12th grade Government class. Our teacher was old and apathetic and instead of teaching us, he usually led current event trivia games which I always rocked at, despite sucking at everything else in life. 

When I got internet at 15, it was like my compulsive encyclopedia habit, but on steroids. But it pretty much just meant that I wasted way more time that didn't translate into anything good. I haven't found any success or happiness in adult life by having a bunch of shallow knowledge about random shit. 

I started a "competency based" liberal arts degree program recently. I thought that all my wikipedia binges would finally benefit me by helping me get through classes a lot quicker. I'm not finding that to be true, because my knowledge of specific topics is not comprehensive, and my recall memory is getting worse as I get older.

 Well, you are doing this in a hi-tech field where this kind of job progression is considered normal and desirable. This. So glad I fell into this line of work and then 20+ years later find out I have ADHD. Dodged a bullet. Last holiday season (or rather, Black Friday/Cyber Monday) I splurged on all sorts of new computer gear--a mechanical keyboard, a gaming mouse, a fancy new headset.  They're serving me really well and I can really tell the difference every day when I go to work and have to use the cheap plastic mouse and keyboard there...

I've experienced ADHD impulse purchases all too well, but I feel new equipment falls under a different category, since a computer is something that you're always going to use, and high quality products are going to last you even longer than the computer does.

That's just my two cents though!  Especially if you only have a laptop--I wouldn't really invest in a new keyboard for that. I bought a mechanical keyboard from Monoprice for $50 a few months ago, and was so happy with it I ordered one for work too.

Update: Apparently "a few months ago" was acutally back in January. So I've had the first one for a decent amount of time. [And it's on sale for $36](http://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=13785). I came to realize that I might have ADHD from attending a cluttering/hoarding support group. So totally identify with buying stuff for projects and not wanting to let go of them later. I thought I would chip in after reading, surprisingly, 10-12 replies here. 

I am the Jack of all Trades you speak of, like yourself I am easily distracted by Wikipedia. Easily mislead to opening up a fresh tab of Reddit even though I just closed /r/fountainpens two seconds ago. 

I have a double degree in Aviation & Business, a commercial pilots licence, various boat/yacht licences, I'm creative yet mathematical too, hell I even took up knitting once. 

My 'career' what ever you call that, is a crazy mix of hospitality/retail when younger, moving up to an industrial bakery and transport/logistics, along with working within the  telecommunications industry. Even prior to this I was working on superyachts. 

I think I have found my hobby though, photography. 
It's intricate, it's expressive, it's technical, you can easily blow money on things (cough cough telephoto primes). 

I suggest you pick from something where your interests reside. So for me I have a few, photography being the main driver of them. Find something and pick at it, understand it, and if you can't teach someone else about it, you don't know it well enough. =) That's me. Being broke keeps me reigned in. But I have to get better at not letting the research consume me. And have you found Ravelry to be like crack? 

I like the 3 project rule but I would have to finish so many projects already started to get there. Sticking to small projects is also very wise. 3D printing and woodworking for me. I think having a finished thing is motivating to me. Shows I don't completely waste my time. Is cool as shit, look up Female Cosmetic Coalition on wikipedia. It's just a theory but it makes a weird kind of sense. I'd link it but I forgot to buy batteries for my mouse and my wallet is missing and the banks are closed so I have to do everything on keyboard, sorry. Yeah, I wanted someone to make the point that we do come back to certain hobbies again later.  Oh thank god I'm not alone! Something about handwriting things as opposed to typing them makes important things stick in my brain longer. I know there's science behind it, too. But, really, I love having my little notebook because it looks so pretty (I think I'm one of the last people my age to still regularly write in cursive) and it makes me feel like I'm actually getting things done.  > my 

This has definitely been my thing at least a few times over the years. I really want to spend money on a nice pen and a few really pretty inks! But I'm worried that I'll not keep it up, and my handwriting isn't very nice to begin with, nice pens don't make it better for long, and after a while it's just horribly messy handwriting in really pretty ink xD Uh.. Make Adderall for the rest of us. Hahaha me too! Oh, I so wish someone had told me that design was a thing when I was a kid. I majored in math and minored in art and was lucky enough to fall into computer programming in CAD/CAM which is visual and geometric. 

When I took the neuropsych testing, I got 49/50 and 50/50 on the visual memory test and was pleased to learn that good visualization and spatial skills are associated with ADHD. 

It does seem like it is really important with ADHD to figure out how to use your strengths to forge a life because trying to force ourselves to act like neurotypicals really doesn't work well and takes too much energy. Becoming a doctor involves so much skulldrugery that it almost isn't worth it. It's 4 years of digesting way more detail than you ever wanted. I teach and for me it's perfect! I get to be around cool teenagers, use technology (digital boards in classrooms, construct my notes beforehand with pics and clips and then I have a structure, and it's fun), trivia (perfect for my subjects) and my students think I am the smartest ever, even though I always tell them I am a surface scholar. I also can connect and relate to almost all clics of people, which helps. I never get bored, everyday is a new day of the challenge of spell bounding teenagers. The gratification is instant ("wow, I never thought I would like to know about", "is class over already?!", "You inspire me", "I thought about what you said last week" and so on). l HATE grading and correcting though... Only downside.  Yup. I'm like this too. I like learning languages as a hobby. Once you learn a language, it also becomes a skill that can be useful in many ways, unlike say, gaming. Yeah, that's currently the step I'm on. Although I'm fairly certain I'm slipping one step further into "You know what, I'm not going to get into any hobbies at all lest I waste any more time/money."  Idk that usually resolves into just watching tv for a day instead of doing something productive.  Yeah! I have a 'scarf' that I've been working on for at least the last 10 years! :P I started it when my family was crafting one day and I think I've come back to it three or four times... I've recently put it back in the cupboard again. I think it's half done? any suggestions for little notebooks? Messy handwriting is a-okay. But it's also trainable if you want to improve!  Good idea.  Same here. Though it's usually binge watching TV while playing video games. My most recent feat was binge watching the latest 6 seasons of Supernatural and most of the first season of House while completing Kingdom Hearts final mix until 2am each day for the last 5 days (I was off work sick aha). I forgot to eat at least two meals (which is bad because I only eat two meals per day) and forgot to do my washing. I've tried but I keep getting distracted :( and my messiness is often out of needing to write quickly :/
