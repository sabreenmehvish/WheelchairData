Rebuilding Cognitive Skills So for the past decade, which seems like FOREVER, I have felt my intellect slowly and painfully decline. I’m currently on meds which are working decent at the moment. I want to start rebuilding my cognitive skills, but I have no clue as to where to begin. Earlier today I was trying to have a conversation and couldn’t remember the word “disciplined”. I feel like an idiot sometimes. I’ve tried looking for books or educational tools that improve your vocabulary and helps you sound more articulate and improves memory. I use to be really smart and deep down I probably still am, but I’m doing a terrible job of showing it. 😩

If you have any advice it would be great!  Eat healthy, EXERCISE is key. And try brain teasers. Like mobile games designed to keep you thinking in new, creative ways. 

Your brain is as much a muscle as any other in your body. Gotta keep it in shape. Maybe reading ? It helped me . I understand completely, and reading helps a great deal. I jump around from wiki page to wiki page (yay ADHD) and that helped too I guess. I incorporated that into my habits, such as when eating, and I would literally wiki the ingredients that's in my food. I would still jump from page to page, but at least it kept me reading, lol.

Udemy helps me too. Learning new stuff is great. Just make sure to finish courses before buying a new one. I made the mistake of buying a ton and never finished a single one. I'm also in a similar situation as you, and I was just prescribed Adderall literally like a week ago. Slowly getting things done ever since.

Focus on the small wins. :) Crossword puzzles! And don't be afraid to look up words you don't know, that's how you get better! Sleep well, exercise, eat good food, try to be happy. Read books you want to read, doesn't matter how useful they are if you'll never pick them up.  Wow! I never thought of it like that, you’re right though. I guess I didn’t really “lose”, my intelligence, my brain is just out of shape. You are freaking awesome this makes me feel even more motivated to start working out more. 💪👍 What books do you recommend? 😊 You’re welcome friend! Best of luck. Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer and Crime and Punishment by  Fyodor Dostoevsky are my favourites :) Thank you!
