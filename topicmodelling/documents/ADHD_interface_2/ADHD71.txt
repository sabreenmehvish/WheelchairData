My doctor doesn’t believe I have ADHD because my marks are good. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD years ago by my old psychologist but it was years ago so when I asked her if she could email me the papers she said she didn’t have them anymore. My current psychiatrist does not believe that I have adhd because I also have anxiety and depression. I  have all the symptoms of adhd: inability to sit still for a long period of time, misplacing things, blurting out words, interrupting people when they speak, getting overwhelmed VERY quickly, not being able to keep a consistent work schedule, so many ups and downs, and the most important one I CANNOT MAKE MYSELF READ! I used to be able to read books and textbooks but the words do not go in. I just keep thinking about how long it’s going to take to finish and I don’t do it. I took a class this semester and we had to read every night and I ended up skipping two days just to listen to the audiobook. I cannot take this anymore I’m not functioning at my full capacity because my current doctor will not prescribe me meds because my marks are good. My marks are good because I work SUPER hard for exams and my boyfriend has written almost all my papers that require reading (yes I know horrible) but I need to pass my classes so he helps. I used to take adderall and it helped but gave me HUGE HUGE downers almost to the point where I was suicidal so i don’t want to take that again but I’m looking for someone else that can help me. I tried Wellbutrin XL and I was actually able to sit still again and read but I had weight gain and severe anxiety so I stopped it. How can I convince my doctor to help me?! I’m tired of living this way.  Honestly, get a new doctor. I got through uni with good marks before being medicated. I'm also adhd as fuck.  Idiot doctor. High iq is known to compensate for ADHD throughout early life. Suddenly innate talent isn't enough and it ends in depression  I'm not reading all of that but my first doctor said I definitely did not have ADHD because kids with ADHD are "Aggressive and usually look like they've had a lot of fights, trust me you don't have ADHD".  Have you told your doctor everything you said here? If he or she isn’t open to reason, can you switch? I was really good at reading books I wanted to read as a kid but not so good at textbooks or assigned reading—basically, when learning was still fun in elementary school it was great, 

when it started to be challenging in high school I tanked, had to drop out of a textbook-based AP history course because it felt *physically painful* to try to slog through the textbook and I failed the first quarter.

**Get a new doctor.**

**Maybe look into official psychological testing.**

And look into other, lesser known childhood symptoms of ADHD—look up some checklists.

**Consider getting a therapist, too**, if you don’t have one already, or working on the problems you’re having in therapy. OP, when I was 12/13 my doctor noticed my symptoms and got me officially diagnosed but I refused to take meds because I didn't think I had a problem. This was because I could focus fine in school and when reading, turns out that was just the stuff I happened to hyperfocus on. Just because you could read perfectly fine previously doesn't mean you didn't have symptoms, I had crippiling ones when I thought I was okay. Only recently when I realized it's been 2 years since I read a book, my favorite past time, did I think it over again and pull my head out of my ass and finally got myself help. I don’t like that because I was one of those kids growing up. I was really smart, but also crazy hyper and a bit inattentive. I was smart enough I’d get most lessons halfway thru class, but “behaved” enough I didn’t often get in trouble past age 9 or so for being disruptive even though I was bored silly. 

Problems really started when I “topped out” about mid high school. As the assignments got more tied to a complex task over a longer period of time the work results plummeted. Of course, “plummeting” was from “all A’s” to “some B’s” so it was just wrote off as being a teenager. It’s a clear flag now, I would budget the time to do the work... and sit for two hours reading the encyclopedia instead (like Wikipedia, but printed in books). 

College crushed me. Once the classes got to that point where you only discuss the assignments and don’t review everything in class because of time I got really far behind. It wasn’t for lack of spending time on the work. Even now at work I have the same problems.. I can sketch out the skeleton of a complex project really quickly, but it takes weeks to do the “fill-in” work until I “get it” and get lots of stuff done in a day. 

I’m curious too. I briefly took Adderall as an adult, but like you said the agitation and crashes were disruptive (I’m also an aspie). Wellbutrin and Buspar worked for a bit, but those made me “emotionless” and cold (but I stopped arguing) and the sexual dysfunction alienated the (ex)wife completely. 

But I’m in a similar boat. I have a good job, take care of kids, but there’s zero personal life, hobbies, vacations, etc because I can only just barely hold it together.  I'm guessing you have a relatively high IQ? And are really good at figuring out coping mechanisms to deal with deficits from ADHD? Because I'm having the same issue. She hasn't cut out my meds . . . yet. But because I wasn't diagnosed as a kid now I can't have it as an adult? I miss my old psych, he died of pancreatic cancer. Yeah -- we can sometimes overperform in certain areas and mask our symptoms.  E..g, I did well enough when I was younger to be admitted to one of the best engineering schools in my country and yet I'm so indescribably fucking impaired, even my high school teachers would tell you I was a train wreck.  Get a better doctor.  Those who specialize in ADHD really understand this stuff better than your run-of-the-mill psychiatrist.  I have traveled to a different state to find one such doctor. my marks are great, still got diagnosed

your doctor is an ignorant asshole Same. I didn’t know I had adhd until after college when working became increasingly unbearable. I graduated magna cum laude but had a lot of coffee and project based classes vs. reading-centric classes. Tell that doctor to go fuck himself He says that usually if you have adhd you have the symptoms in childhood. I was able to read normally up until about 15 or 16 years old so “i don’t have adhd” . I was never able to make friends in school though so that says something. Isn’t it true that you can show symptoms as an adult ? So it's true that if you have ADHD it has to have presented in childhood (you used to have to show symptoms before the age of 7, but in the most recent diagnostic criteria it's been changed to show symptoms before the age of 12). Essentially, if you didn't have ADHD symptoms in childhood before 12 years old, then you can't suddenly develop ADHD later in life. (To be clear, you can definitely be diagnosed as an adult and show ADHD symptoms in adulthood, but you definitely need to show symptoms as a child as well...I was diagnosed as an adult but I showed symptoms since I was a child which went unnoticed at the time). 

You said you read "normally" until 15/16 yrs old, so your difficulty with reading now probably wouldn't be considered an ADHD symptom due to its late onset. You said in your OP that your reading difficulty was the most important, but I just want to say that although many people with ADHD do have trouble reading, there are plenty who are able to read fine (for myself, I tend to get lost in or hyperfocus on a book I'm reading, so reading ability isn't always a very useful measure for ADHD diagnosis). 

I want to also mention that anxiety and depression can have many similar symptoms to ADHD, including distractibility, forgetfulness, trouble focusing, etc., so that could be one explanation. 

Ultimately, if your doctor is not at least exploring all the explanations/options for your symptoms, then you may want to see a new doctor. You can also get neuropsychological testing done which will be a more scientific approach to diagnosis (rather than relying solely on symptoms or anecdotes). Best of luck!



TLDR:

-ADHD symptoms MUST be present in childhood (before age 12)

-Many people do get diagnosed as an adult (but still had symptoms in childhood, regardless)

-Often ADHD symptoms persist into adulthood and last through entire life

-Having difficulty with reading can be ADHD symptom, but plenty of ADHDers don't have reading difficulty, so not most important symptom

-Anxiety and depression can cause ADHD-like symptoms (forgetfulness, distractibility, trouble focusing, etc)



 Symptoms always start in childhood. This isn't a degenerative illness. 

That said, the symptoms are not present in all circumstances. Maybe school is one of the environments where your brain still works Newer research on ADHD, particularly for inattentive type ADHD in women with high IQ, says that it may be difficult to functionally diagnose until after puberty when the effects of estrogen exacerbate ADHD symptoms and that combined with increasing challenges overtake any masking due to high IQ.
