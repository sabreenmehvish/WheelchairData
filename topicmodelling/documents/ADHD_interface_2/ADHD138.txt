**Some advice to start with:**

* Keep it simple and short.  We're trying to get stuff done, not have a lot to get done.

* Prioritize your list

* Plan some reward time for yourself when you get tasks done.

* There are some things that you're good at off your medicine and some things you can only do on them.  If you can identify them you can plan to do them at the easiest time for you.

---

**Examples from previous weeks:**

* Order new shoes. 

* Survive through finals.

* Cook and eat at least two meals a day... *every* day of the week. 

* Work on coping strategies X minutes a day.

* Spend meaningful one on one time with each child. 

* Get ready and *leave the house* for *any* reason.

 my only plan for the week is to take over the world, or maybe just not let stuff get to me.  i did a stellar job yesterday in identifying triggers and not internalizing stuff :)   I actually managed to study today. Just gotta get back to certain people now.  * Make dinner all week instead of neglecting my nutrition. waking up before 9am every day this week! At least 3 sections of calculus! -try to fix my sleep issues
-cut back a little more on caffiene and nicotine
-find some exercises to help manage back pain I will try to not get overwhelmed at work this week and also do some reading for uni. Read my book and spend my 4 day weekend having FUN and taking care of myself before starting my new job next Monday Play with my cat for 15 mins/ day at least.  Complete those 3 nagging online forms I have been meaning to do since about May.  This reminded me to text my mom back!  What kind of back pain are you having?  I never even saw this. I have spinal stenosis. With the cold weather doing its thing I'm in the process of getting another epidural injection.
