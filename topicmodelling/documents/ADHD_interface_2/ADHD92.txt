I wish there was a subtitles option for when I’m listening to someone speak. It would be like reading along and make retention so much better for me.   Me too.  And a "skip back 15 seconds" button . . .

I've felt this way all my life.  In college I tried to record lectures so I could review them later at my own pace.  It's easier for me to listen to someone talk to me if I close my eyes.  I turn on subtitles whenever possible. That’s a genius idea. Honestly, I’m tired of trying to manage my ADHD to be more like neurotypicals. I want my damn easy button.  I love putting the subtitles on for educational YouTube videos. It helps me actually learn from them and stay focussed That is called "ticker tape synesthesia" and makes me pay less attention to what was said. I liken my brain to a poorly tuned radio.

Sometimes it comes in loud and clear, but I can't seem to change the station no matter how hard I try.

Sometimes the Spanish station blares in and out.

Sometimes it's just static. I have that problem - I have central auditory processing. When I am trying to hear and there is too much noise it is really hard!
Not just you - I try to lip read just make sure I am catching everything. This is why they have emails and texts instead of phone calls nowadays. As soon as it's not weird to wear AR glasses in public, this can be a thing... I actually built a program that uses Google's speech API to transcribe what my teachers are saying, that way I can glance back just in case Damn if that's not the truth. I had to read from the paper and interviewer was asking questions from last week just to focus STORY TIME

Friend and I are watching a show and there are two different languages spoken, french and english at various points. We go to a new episode and in the first scene they are talking but there are no subtitles. So her and I decide they must be speaking french and that we don't get subtitles because they don't want us to understand what they are saying for plot reasons.

THIS GOES ON

FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES

finally we realize, fuck, they are speaking English. We had accidentally turned off subtitles or something. We turn subtitles back on, rewind, and watch the scene. Yeah. They were speaking english the whole time. We just assumed it was a foreign language because we couldn't understand them.

the struggle is extra real.  So true. I hate talking to someone and then thinking to myself "what did they say again?" or watching a video and just rewatching it over and over again trying to pay attention As someone with ADHD and hearing loss who has to make people repeat themselves despite wearing hearing aides... yes, I also need this. oh my god! I just realized something. Reading the ADD forum and you using the word subtitles just made me have an epiphany. I actually went and got my hearing tested a few months ago and they said I do not have hearing loss. I always use subtitles when i watch movies or TV. I kept saying why do I need this? Some movies the actors do kinda mumble but most of the time I think it's just auditory processing disorder (APD). My daughter was formally diagnosed with it and it's clear I have it too.  So is this the reason I always watch movies and tv series with subtitles??  So my friend and I get together about once or twice a year and the whole time we talk about music and she understands that showing me songs with their lyrics help me so much to be apart of the conversation. Only tough part is when they show me their own songs but they give me their notebook with their lyrics and it's awesome  This is why recorded lectures are a goddamn gift.  I've thought this before. It would be nice. I wish there was a "speed up x3" option. Maybe I'd stop falling asleep in class the time lol I remember thinking that when I was watching something ...and missed what they were saying literally 2 minutes in then turned on the CC. Cue the angel heaven hallelujah music. 

Why can't it beee truuuuueee hahah.  Dear gods, guys! Didn't any of you heed the warning from Adam Sandler's Click?!  YES!

I wish I could pause time, read a transcript of what someone just said, think for a while on a response that won't be my usual jumbly bumbly mess and press play. 

 That would be so helpful! I'm on the spectrum as well, so that makes listening to someone speak even harder at times. Subtitles would make my life so much easier. Especially if they have an accent!!! When I try to remember song lyrics, I have imagine the words going by like a TelePrompTer.  When I was tested for ADHD a few years ago, one of the tests I took was the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test, 2nd Edition \(IVA\-2\). If any of you ever get tested, I recommend asking about this test \(or something similar\).

Anyway, I thought I'd [share my results](https://photos.app.goo.gl/vEqMqmfgOQRgPfR43), in case it helps anyone. \(Start at the underlined text.\)

Basically, my auditory attention span is terrible: sustained attention is 1&#37;! Jeez! My visual attention span isn't much better, although I'm sure my visual perception abilities are helping to drag that up significantly. \(My Perceptual Reasoning on a WAIS\-IV test is 98&#37;.\)

So, I guess what I'm saying is that auditory impairment is a very real and significant part of ADHD. I’m sure we will have glasses that will do this soonish  I'd probably start thinking about how it worked, why they chose the color they did, and how the system could be improved  and completely miss the content. I don’t know if this is due to the ADHD or what. My hearing is fine, but I need subtitles on everything. Anyone else have this issue? Any insight into why?  My mom and sister constantly get mad at me when I kind of space out and ask them to repeat what they said. I really, REALLY need a backspace button. Is this why I use subtitles on everything that has them? Never realized why I liked that lol Active listening helps me keep up with the conversation: at brief intervals, summarize what they’ve said, or how they seem to feel about it.  It can be awkward at first but with practice it becomes completely natural. I always thought I had subtitles on because I had bad hearing, so I had a hearing test with an audiologist and they awkwardly told me my hearing was actually pretty good...you just now made me realize why I need subtitles. One way of aiding this is to look at the speaker's mouth when they are talking. We actually perceive sound information differently based on visual cues (it's called the [MaGurk Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect)). It seemed counterintuitive to me at first to look at someone's mouth (rather than turning my head to listen), but it's helped me a lot when I'm in a situation where I'm having trouble understanding someone. A bonus is that it makes me look like I'm really interested in what the other person has to say... I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/u_oscararmandorz] [That’s so like me](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_oscararmandorz/comments/8ctzjn/thats_so_like_me/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* This would be a godsend for me as well. I wish the same. And though it’s of no use during casual conversations, there are speech to text programs that exist. So if you ever record a lecture or talk. Otherwise it’s captions on every video and amazon music puts the lyrics for a lot of songs right on the screen, moving in real-time. So that’s nice! Digital recorder = life I'm sure that we will have augmented reality glasses in the near future that will do just that! It will be great...expecially in restaruants where I have a hard time blocking out the conversations around me! I would have an excuse to avoid eye contact. Good words! I was trying to figure out how to explain how the ADHD 'noise' thing is and I can talk about this a bit. You and me both. I've gotten way better since being medicated and so long as I'm having a 'good medicine' day I don't struggle with this. However, before I was medicated (or on 'bad medicine' days) I used to focus on a person's lips and try to read them as they were talking. By doing that it helped me focus a bit more and kept me from being distracted. 

Hope this helps! This explains a lot for why I like subtitles in movies so much. I am embarrassingly bad at remembering people’s names. 

I feel like I’m so excited to meet them and so focused on being charming / not saying anything weird, that I can’t retain basic details.  I would pay tons of money for this life feature.

I also have auditory processing issues, so unless I'm both looking at the person and focusing, what they say sounds like gibberish. It's one reason I stop paying attention. Like I need another reason. This would be fantastic Yes to all of this Subtitles, pause, rewind, and speed up would be a godsend. One of my favorite features on youtube is the 1.5x and 2x speed for videos. It actually makes watching lectures and instructional videos possible for me without wanting to blow my brains out 2 minutes in. Plus it saves a ton of time. 

I honestly think if all of my lectures in college had been recorded videos on youtube, I would have been a straight A student, because 99% of my lost marks were from losing focus in class and missing information or skipping classes altogether. Sitting through lectures was torture. 

I think MOOC's, youtube content, and online degrees might be the biggest revolution in the history of education, and definitely a game-changer for people with ADHD. I never understood why it was necessary for professors to deliver all of their lectures live in the classroom year after year, when they could just record all of the content once instead and let everyone watch at their own pace. Finally, decades later it looks like people are just starting to realize that traditional education is terrible--and not just for people with ADHD but for everyone, although us ADHD'ers are some of the most affected.  I've never managed to get a single address right when someone gives me directions because I just drone off. 

I struggled massively in college after coasting through high school. College lectures in huge halls would mean that I would just drone off. It wasn't until I met my girlfriend and she started teaching me (she was a Master's student when I was in my junior year) that my grades improve drastically

Man, this sub feels so right. I never knew that these were actually issues. I just thought that everyone struggles through them.

Like I've been trying to learn music production. I've got all these tons of videos but for the life of me, I can't sit through them. I just want to read but it's impossible to "read" how a chord has to be played  And a ‘pause reality so I can get more sleep and take my time getting ready and allow plenty of time to get to work so I’m not late’ button. That would be super. This!! I ask my (talkative) husband to "go back 30 seconds" all the time. (I got the idea from listening to audiobooks on an iPhone.)

I once explained to him that I tend to latch on to one part of what he says; and I follow that train of thought too far away from the conversation to keep up.

I think it's really mutually beneficial, because this way he feels heard. At this point he gets it and effortlessly obliges. But man I wish I had that option with everyone. Recording never worked for me (I'd just zone right back out when it replayed it), so I usually took such extensive notes during college classes that I practically transcribed the lecture. Having to keep up while writing or typing was the only thing that kept me engaged. i tried to record the lectures but i never listened to them :/ YES!  Sometimes I swear my brain hears things so wrong and then when it's replayed I wonder how I came to the conclusion I did! > a "skip back 15 seconds" button

Holy shit. This sub make me suspect I have adhd. There is on YouTube Yeah, I tend to do the [JD thing](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQsbe94ckmlVK6oada9RHZznC5CP80C3JaHZbR2xVTyiy4l04Vs6Q) where I look away toward a blank spot on the wall when I'm concentrating on something. I'm basically shutting out a little bit of external stimuli to allow me to more reliably process what I'm thinking about.

Unfortunately, we can close our eyes whenever we want, but we can't close our ears without earplugs, and those don't even work 100&#37;. Or a “pause” or “fast forward” lol I feel you so much. I'm fucking exhausted. Just one freaking day where they adjust to me instead o the other way around.

We could have a day per year for various disorders.

It's like those autism friendly musicals. But the whole world just adjusts for a day or two.

If only. I wish more people would try to meet me on my level instead of forcing me to come to theirs Not even an "easy" button. I'd settle for a "not hard" button. I use subtitles for everything if I can  I have this too but I really like it.  OP is right, it helps a lot with retention.  I've always had an uncanny ability to remember things word for word and I figured out it was because I'm "reading" everything that I hear and having a visual helps me remember. Sometimes it's like three different stations overlapping. I liken my brain to a radio playing ten stations at once, all playing the same ten songs on repeat, and the djs are drunk toddlers who need a nap.  There’s a name for that? I have to turnoff the radio or mute the tv when someone starts talking  Came here to say this.  Apparently it is often found in people with ADHD.  If your spouse has gotten mad at you for fake mishearing because you heard, "Your suits stare," instead of, "On the stairs over there," you might have it.  I get it in several forms:

- my brain refusing to separate the tracks of what I'm hearing so I can separate conversation from background
- my brain hearing the words but refusing to turn those words into meaning.  It almost feels like half of my brain is just forgetting to pass the info along to the rest of my brain
- if I'm particularly tired, people talking seems to gain a reverb effect like a microphone too close to a speaker.

Fortunately, the same meds I take for ADHD seem to negate this problem too. My most memorable conversations are ones that happened in person or on a phone call and then had the important things texted to me. Especially when talking to my mom because we’re both ADHD so our conversations are all over the place Yeah I've gotten almost everyone I know to text or instant message me important stuff instead. Makes it way easier.  Could be a thing *now* for people who don't care about looking weird/are willing to splurge on the less-weird-looking ones, but automatic captions aren't good enough to be worth the expense imo.

Soon, though... soooooon. I guess caption generation is pretty good now. A few years ago though you'd have difficulty telling what the captions meant, and one more distraction to deal with as the text generated hilarious/random phrases. Im sure there are a lot of people on this subreddit who would love to have that. Is it something you can share/sell?  Also, I enjoy looking for typos in the subtitles. Sometimes there’s some really funny ones.  Exactly this lol Ugh. This is me. 

But I'm being fitted for hearing aides for the first time today! 

I really hope they help at least a bit with my comprehension. I'll still have ADHD but at least I hope to eliminate one of its most debilitating aggravators.   Why do we need subtitles for everything?! Any insight? My hearing is fine as well!  I jumped on this thread wondering if anyone else would say the same! I don’t have subtitles *all* the time but I do a lot. I’ve given up on mumble speakers altogether irl too and just accept that I have no idea what’s going on and revert into my own head. I have to have subtitles, they improve my hearing lol Well I try. But that means I actually have to pay attention vs multitask.  Yes! I love reading along with the lyrics to new songs  I was actually thinking about that movie when I typed that lol I imagine karaoke promoters lol! Thank you so much for sharing!  I can’t keep the glasses I have clean I'm not sure either, but I think there is some sort of associated audible language processing issue. I cannot retain info well just listening to it in general. I tried audio books and could not recall what happened a few chapters back because the experience is far too passive, but when reading the same book every detail stuck. It's like the same areas of the brain responsible for focus and attention (and executive functions) are also responsible for processing spoken words. Or maybe audible language processing requires the use of executive function and since we have trouble there, we also have trouble audible language processing. Maybe that's why outside noise is so disruptive to our thought process. *ramble ramble*

Seems like every year of primary school until I got to high school I got pulled out of class for hearing test, and when those would come back indicating no hearing issue, I'd be sent back for various other learning disabilities test. It would always be one-on-one environment and i'd feel challenged so i'd completely rock them. Some time they'd even begin to suspect I was gifted and just bored with the classroom material. I'm guessing that didn't go anywhere either since I was never placed in anything other than regular classes. I WAS a little bored with the material at times, mostly i'd start out thinking about what was being taught and then my mind notice some detail that peaked my interest (sometimes in the subject matter, sometimes on the wall or out a window) and it would start wondering off in that direction, and the next thing you know, 30 minutes later my mind was miles away from the classroom discussion and I had no idea what was going on in class. My bf makes me stop what I’m doing and make eye contact  I love lists Thank you for the link!  May I ask, are you male or female? And what is considered a bad medicine day?  I'm currently doing my masters though the open university.it is completely online based, all the work is there from the start and I can work through it at my own pace, keeping to assignment deadlines. The tutorials are all online so I can move about whilst participating, do other things, and not distract any one else. It is such a difference from when I did my undergrad in the normal uni environment. My grades are much better. Thank heavens I'm not the only one who wants watches their YouTube videos on 1.5x and 2x speed! It's time saving and more engaging. I find that in order to understand something that quickly, I have to listen closer - meaning that I actually have to listen and pay attention. 
The bane of my existence are videos assigned by professors that are hosted on platforms that don't have those adjustable speed options.  A lot of them do it like that because they don't want kids skipping class  If it wasnt for online education I never would of made it back to college.  To be honest I'm an English major and YouTube public domain audiobooks are saving my life right now. I just put in earbuds and play racing games and my comprehension finally kicks in.  Do you remember that 2002 Nickelodeon movie "[Clockstoppers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockstoppers)"? Weirdly, that movie kinda fucked me up -- I didn't know how desperately I needed that nonexistent technology until I saw that movie and I was obsessed with the concept. I have this issue with my husband too and I like how you explained it. That’s a good way to validate that it’s not that you’re not paying attention. 

I get frustrated because I will specifically repeat the start of whatever specific thought I need him to fill in the blank about and he’ll go back to the top. Sometimes, he’ll even start rephrasing from the top dumbed-down. I’ll interrupt to clarify that I got it, I just wanted to hear how he phrased whatever tiny specific thing again. So I’ll always end up being rude because I’m interrupting but it’s also I’m low-key insulted he thinks I don’t understand the bigger point. So then it’s this THIRD thread of “wait you think I don’t comprehend or wasn’t listening at all?” I should try to break down what’s happening for him like you have. Or he could just fill in the damn blank like I asked.  I do this with my husband too. Sometimes I literally wander away while he's talking because I remembered to turn off a light or something. Then I have to walk back and be like "Crap, sorry, repeat?" And sometimes I have to ask him to go back because he just starts talking and I don't realize and I miss the first half of what he says. To be fair, this is mostly his fault at this point because I've asked him FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS to please make sure he has my attention before he launches into a topic. Otherwise all I hear is ".... and that's what I think will happen if I do it. What do you think?"And then he gets offended when I ask him to repeat himself :P This is EXACTLY what works for me. As long as I'm actively doing something, I feel fine. Note taking helps a TON.  Why are you here? Honest curiosity. I prefer reading over listening because I read faster than the pace that most people speak. I get so bored sometimes when people are droning on about stuff, I have to struggle to not interrupt.

On the flip side, it can take forever for me to say something, because it takes so much time for me to put together a coherent sentence out of the jumble of ideas in my head. Yes! Do you know if that is an ADHD trait? Or something unrelated? I have the same issues as you but didn't realise it was a thing. OMG...thank you! I have all of this. Even if there is a soft noise going on, I can't hear someone speaking. And the second bullet point affects me so much during lectures. I hear the words, but they're just random recognisable sounds that have no meaning attached.  And you remember it when you can *see* it 🤔🤓 [deleted] I don't know I was suprised how accurate the auto captions on Youtube are for English around 90% of the time. (other languages not so much though) Ive written it using Python and have given myself administrator on my school laptop, but I'll put it into an app if I can get time. If anyone wants to help, PM me :) lol in the middle of typing i realized I had a story and changed the comment entirely  “Garbled.” That’s how many adults describe communicating and living with auditory processing disorder (APD). APD makes it difficult to understand and interpret information presented orally. Auditory processing disorder in adults may manifest as poor listening skills, poor reading comprehension, or miscommunication that causes trouble with coworkers, partners, family and friends. For many people, living with APD is “like trying to listen on a cell phone with the signal cutting in and out,” according to Lois Kam Heymann, M.A., CCC-SLP.

“There’s no tiny speaker inside your brain that relays messages from the outside,” explains neurologist Martin Kutscher, M.D., author of ADHD – Living without Brakes. “What you think you ‘hear’ is a virtual-reality recreation of sounds that stopped at your eardrum and, from there on, exist as soundless electrical impulses.”

Here’s what happens in an exchange between speaker and listener:

The speaker’s vocal cords produce a sequence of vibrations that travel invisibly through the air and land on the recipient’s eardrums.
The listener’s eardrums vibrate, causing movement of three tiny bones that, in turn, stimulate the cochlear nerve. This is essentially where “sound” ends.
From this point, what the listener thinks he “hears” is actually a series of silent electrical stimuli carried by neuronal wires.
“The brain processes these electrical impulses into sounds, then into words, and then into meaningful sentences and ideas,” Kutscher says. “Most of us do it effortlessly. Some adults have problems in converting these electrical neuronal impulses into meaning. We call these problems Central Auditory Processing Disorders.” At first I only used subtitles when watching things in other languages, but now I use captions even when watching things in my native language. It helps me stay more engaged or turn the audio down some since I don't have to struggle to hear it accurately as much. I thought I needed to go back for a new prescription recently. 

...I just needed to clean them better. The auditory processing issue would make a lot of sense. I LOVE audiobooks but my retention from listening vs reading is drastically lower. 

Throughout high school and college I would sleep or do something else in every single class. I kept getting in trouble, so many parent teacher conferences on my sleeping in class or interrupting class to talk to people. However despite never paying attention I would self teach the material and do just fine. I don’t remember anything verbal but I do remember things that are written. This translates into so many areas of life. Even if you’re giving me verbal directions I can take maybe 2-3 turns but if I read it then I’ve got it down.  Female and bad medicine day is usually when my Vyvanse doesn't work properly or it makes me anxious. This can happen for a variety of reasons most being lack of sleep, drinking too much the day before (which doesn't happen as often anymore thank god), or a couple days on my period.

^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^171655 I straight up cackled at this because it's so relatable and perfectly said.

He responds like your brain is working at half processing speed instead of double time, like it is. If you're like me, you orient yourself towards a global perspective of what he's saying from the get go and in your hurry to piece it all together, you miss some details. Right? Oh gosh, same -- you gotta grab my attention before you need it. I might even need a second to transition my focus.

This reminds me of another trick I use. It's kind of abstract, but I'm gonna try to explain it...

Sometimes my husband will start talking to me and while I hear every word, I still can't make sense of what he's getting at. Often it happens when I've been hyper focusing and I haven't yet fully shifted my focus. Other times, I suspect it's because I'm trying to figure out "the point" before he's made it. Regardless, the trick is that I basically ask for a topic sentence. He doesn't even have to tell me "the point" -- just a verbal nudge in the direction he's going is enough to clear up my brain to listen. 

I explained it by saying that it feels like I'm reading a letter without first seeing the envelope; and I need more information before I can take it in. I'll say, "Back up. I need an envelope for this first." And he'll say "I'm trying to tell you what the cats did today."

And then my brain isn't secretly rushing him and I can enjoy his meandering storytelling.

I hope that makes sense! He/she just likes acronyms . . . I have one friend with ADD, I worked at a school where a kid had ADHD, and my friends jokingly say I have ADHD.

Edit: And I like to learn from second hand rather than third hand sources, whenever I can't be... primary hand(?). This is why I always prefer to communicate in writing. Sometimes I get so frustrated trying to have a conversation that I have to go put myself in a “time out” and write my thoughts down and then come back and use my written notes to help me. When I’m trying to think and talk at the same time I end up stuttering, saying “like, um” over and over again or completely forgetting the word I’m trying to say!  It’s ADHD. Everyone I’ve talked to IRL that has ADHD has the same thing. Our brains are weird.  It is! Excerpt from Wikipedia on the matter:

>There is a high rate of co-occurrence between AD/HD and CAPD. Research shows that 84% of children with APD have confirmed or suspected ADHD. Co-occurrence between ADHD and APD is 41% for children with confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 43% for children suspected of having ADHD.[66] Exactly! If it ain't hurting anyone, any criticism of 'weird' is an issue with the person doing the judging.  
I mean i get some people don't want to draw unnecessary attention to themselves but i'm like... ten years, four piercings, and an already large pile of coping mechanisms past caring.

I'm also faceblind and the first time i saw a video about AR glasses it was showing it remembering people's faces/names and that's definitely on the list of 'features which aren't single-handedly enough to get me to buy AR glasses but will definitely get used when i inevitably do'.

I need 'em to either work with regular glasses or have transitional lenses built in though. Sunlight and visual processing issues are an unpleasant combination. YouTube videos also tend to have a consistent audio source and limited number of speakers and well-made YT videos limit background noise which might interfere with automatic captions. Real life, not so much, but i guess it would depend on the circumstances in which you most frequently hold spoken conversations. Wish I knew how to help. I hope you get it out there. Ironically I’m a Neurological ICU nurse and I still can’t wrap my head around my ADHD. This sub has helped me realize just how much ADHD effects every aspect of my life. It’s shown me how I’m not alone in the 1000 things I do that annoy people. Specifically in relation to this thread my poor hearing. I make people repeat things frequently, require subtitles and have trouble hearing. I would describe it as it seems like all the words blur together into a long string with no pauses or a really bad mumble.  My boyfriend will always calmly takes them off my face while I’m talking and takes them to the sink to clean them while I keep jabbering, then slowly puts them back on my face while I finish my rabbit trails. 

He’s a good man. 

Edit: a lot of fuckin typos. I’m stoned  I asked because it’s  been proven that meds work differently during different parts of our monthly cycles.  Lol. I reread the post just now and you had actually already said that. I guess I forgot by the time I finished reading... Ooooh glasses that remember people’s names would be so helpful!! And the subtitles... that is a must! Ah, the ol’ *situational blindness while talking*. [deleted] Like a 5 minute timer that goes off when you lose focus on what you’re supposed to be doing!!
