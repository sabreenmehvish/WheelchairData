I feel a sense of relief and hope after researching ADHD and reading all of your stories I never really took into consideration my childhood and past with how hyperactive and talkative I was.


But as I got older I got so much anxiety I stopped talking to people but my focusing issues and lack of motivation stayed and even increased.


I never even *considered* the fact that I could have ADD when depression is always the go to with my doctors.
 

I never considered the reason why every different single antidepressant I keep getting put on never works. 


Why have I never taken into account that I’ve never been truly sad? 


And that sleeping 16 hours when I can’t focus on any task longer than 5 minutes isn’t because I’m depressed and want to sleep, it’s because I can’t stick to my plans and sleeping seems like a better use of time rather than wasting my time doing art or shopping or even washing my clothes? 


I failed math 3 times in highschool because I couldn’t sit and listen to the explainations and I guess I’ve just blocked that part out of my life because it was never a huge deal to me.

I’m not able to function at home and take care of my animals or even myself. At work I beg to leave early every day because after 2 hours of being there I space out and lose focus so bad I **can’t** be there any longer.


I’m going to the doctor tomorrow to discuss my options, but now that I have something to go off of I’m so immensely happy. I now have a start to finally getting the right medication and help.


Thank you guys. Good luck, OP! Truly, a diagnosis is such an important thing to obtain. Once you have it, relief pours over you. You're not crazy. You're not a *weirdo* (okay, maybe you are. I certainly am, ADHD or not). It can be a huge relief!
