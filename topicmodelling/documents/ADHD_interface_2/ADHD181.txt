I did a thing you guys!! I posted a story about adhd over on writing prompts!! I am quietly stoked with my story and want to share it with you all!

Hey you guys, could you go show me some upvote love over on writing prompts? 

Or maybe write one of your own? 

TL'DR I wrote a story about an adhd spy. because hell yeah!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9w27d9/wp\_write\_a\_story\_about\_a\_person\_with\_adhd\_on\_a/e9h4phk](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9w27d9/wp_write_a_story_about_a_person_with_adhd_on_a/e9h4phk) I've never looked around r/WritingPrompts but I loved reading that! Keep writing. any feedback? guys? hello?

what sucked? what worked? I really would appreciate comments thank you.  Thank you so much for responding! I wondered if anyone had read it üòêüòä

I was so excited to write - had a less than positive childhood where i was told to get a trade - which i did and love my job. But creative things were considered a waste of time. 

So it was so much fun to just do it. I don't know if it's any good but i will keep going thank you!!
