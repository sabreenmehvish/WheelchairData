I Get Sleepy When I Start Reading The moment I look in a book I immediately begin to feel sleepy. My eyes start watering and I start yawning. Does anyone else have this problem? What do you do about it? I've noticed that this happens to me too sometimes. When I hang my head a bit and look down for a while, as I often will when reading a book, my mind kind of fogs up and I might get drowsy.

For me at least, I don't think the act of reading itself is what's causing it; reading while looking straight forward never seems to cause any such issues. So, I've come to think that, maybe for some people, hanging our head down like that just physically triggers drowsiness somehow.

So, when I read, I sometimes just hold the book in front of me rather than in my lap. Maybe that could help you? Oh my god me too! I never knew this was an ADHD thing I thought it was just me. The act of reading makes me so physically sleepy that if I’m sitting up I will start slouching and then lying down and I’ll be out in twenty minutes, when it usually takes me hours to fall asleep. Only fix I’ve found is to read while I wait for my meds to kick in. But even then I only get half an hour to an hour.  I switched to audio books. Lol [deleted] definitely. it's actually a really good sleep aid when i have a rough night. actually, i think writing might make me sleepier, i think my own writing actually bores me to sleep lmao Yes! Reading sitting up is the best way to go. When I study I'm always in a chair with a rolled-up towel between the chair and my lumbar spine. It works just as well for pleasure reading, but it's a trick I learned from a teacher many years ago. Keep your body as erect as possible, and try to avoid reading in bed since your body associates it with sleep.
