I came across this article and thought I let you know, since I found it quite interesting.

This is basically my whole childhood. One day I was using a pen/scissors with my right hand and the next day with my left hand. I did this with a lot of things. As a 25-year-old with ADHD diagnosed around when I was 22, reading the article really described some of the traits I experienced as a child, to the T. Just like week, I found a paper from my elementary school that advised my parents to place me into a bilingual program because I would combine Spanish and English verbs and adjectives. As a right-hander, I too experienced the mix hand use of writing tools.  Can't take this page seriously when they don't provide any references. 

Even though I write with my right hand, brush with my left, kick with my left leg but skate normally, shoot with my right hand but aim with my left eye 🤷‍♂️ welp there's other sources if you just google it. I just posted this link because the text was quite short. :>
