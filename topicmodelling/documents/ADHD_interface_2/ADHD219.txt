Read a chapter, realize you remember nothing of what you read. Read it again. Ad nauseam. Is this typical? So I am trying to get a diagnosis to figure out WTF is wrong with me. I went to a neuropsychiatrist for an evaluation and I came back with the possibility that I might maybe be a little ADD/ADHD (inattentive type). The trouble is that I don't really fit the profile.

Is the reading thing common for people with ADD? It's one of the symptoms that I remember from my childhood when I think of attention difficulties. That and always having a "movie" in my head while "listening" (zoning out and fixating on the board) to the teacher.

My mind usually starts wandering as soon as I start reading. It goes blank and my eyes follow the lines on the page but it's like I don't remember anything I am reading. 

I hope this makes sense to people reading.

****Edit

Thanks for the support everyone, it's nice seeing that I am not alone. 

 As a teacher with ADHD- you need to annotate. What you are doing is passively reading the text, as in you are reading over the words but not doing anything to put the information that the words represent into long term memory. When you read a passage of text that you are not particularly interested in, the sentence first goes into this thing called working memory, and that information only lasts for about 10-15 seconds if you don’t make the effort to do anything with it. In order for your brain to place information into long term memory it must be repeated (to reactivate and thus strengthen the neural connection) or you have to make the effort to connect the new information with prior knowledge (connect to an existing set of neural pathways). Annotating a text forces your brain to rehearse the information. 

Try summarizing each paragraph into 3-4 words in the margins. 
 Yes, my psychiatrist said that this is a very common symptom among people with Inattentive ADHD. I do this all the time, even when I am hyperfocused on reading, I still have a hard time processing the information. It caused many issues when it came to college for me because I couldn't use textbooks to learn material and I would use online sources and videos to learn but as I got to upper division classes online sources and videos became scarce. That happened to me growing up. I could read whole chapters and realize the entire time i was thinking about other things and cannot recall anything i had just ‘read’ Yes. I used to be a voracious reader when I was a kid, the kind parents would yell at for staying up past their bedtime reading under the covers. Then somehow in high school I just kind of lost the ability to read like that. Probably because of the executive functioning load I have to deal with as an adult, makes it harder to devote mental energy to reading. I wish I could read the way I used to as a kid again. > That and always having a "movie" in my head while "listening" 

This, big time.

It's only through repetition that I can absorb reading. So that means re-reading pages, paragraphs, chapters of books.

It sucks. One of my best friends reads two books a week. I would love to. But it takes me weeks to read a book. If I finish it.

If anyone has reading hacks, I'd be very interested. Sometimes reading out loud can help. It might feel silly, but it forces you to digest the content. Is it still possible to drift while doing this? Absolutely. But I have found it more effective than anything else. I often joke when I get book recommendations that I can't read. I've been reading Lord of the Rings for like, 10 years. Every now and then, a book will grab my attention in the right way and it will be done in a day or two (work be damned!). In school it was rough, because I could be in a closet with zero distractions and still read a few sentences, then just stare at the wall for an hour. I'm in the process of getting a diagnosis now, but one of the big drivers to see a Dr was "I just want to be able to sit down and enjoy a book"

As a side note, I have found that an Audio book + text is a good way for me to consume this type of media. It's how I finally got through Harry Potter. I just had to get over the idea that I have to have someone read to me.  I'm not going to lie, I have this badly and on meds I don't  Short answer: it makes perfect sense... with some forms of ADHD.

You should find a developmental optometrist in your area and get tested. A developmental optometrist is not a regular optometrist.

It also might be useful to get some learning assessments done too.    You'll find out your strengths and weaknesses more than "a cure." Yes, that's why I don't read books anymore. Mostly reddit, for anything longer I try to get an audio format. Non fiction is easier as my intellect remains engaged more of the time but it's still hard.  If it’s a book i am enjoying, i will hyperfocus and won’t put it down. “One more chapter” until the sun comes up and i think, “fuck, today is going to suck.” Or I’ll read it while walking to class and continue to read it during lecture. 

If it’s something boring... I’ll read a page, get to the bottom and then realize i wasn’t paying attention at all. Not fun. 

If it’s something with a ton of words i can’t pronounce (like chemicals/behentrimonium or like biblical names/characters i can’t keep in my head) it might as well be in another language. 

I have a difficult time remembering things by listening. I can watch a 2 hour movie and as soon as it’s over i wouldn’t be able to tell you the main characters names. I’ll know the face, what they’re wearing, etc. same if i meet someone new. Even if i repeat their name out loud or to myself, after the conversation is done, I’ll realize i don’t remember their name. I think bc making small talk with new people makes me anxious so my brain is in overdrive trying to figure what to say, how to make my face look like I’m not completely uncomfortable, trying not to say something dumb, saying something lame and then mentally kicking myself for it, etc.  Most definitely for me. My reading habits themselves are pretty haphazard - I tend to skip ahead a few words or even a few sentences, then my eyes dart back, focus on some words in the sentences I missed and then forward again. I absolutely loved reading as a kid (still do, just can't find stuff to read that interests me as much anymore) and would devour books regardless of this habit, but once I started *having* to read stuff for school or work that would usually be super dry or term-heavy then I found myself reading a single paragraph over and over again with absolutely no information retention. Might as well be reading the whole text in another language, except I recognise the words, it's just that once I get to the end I realise they mean nothing to me when strung together like that. Story of my life, my mind wanders and I end up down a rabbit hole of semi related ideas.  Yeah... I usually end up reading the same paragraph over and over until I give up. It’s either I devour a whole book at once or I can’t get started. 

I think this is also similar to how I can drive somewhere and not remember doing it cause I was thinking about something else.  I find that starting in the middle and latching onto whatever happens to be the most interesting/easiest to read helps. Then I just go back and read from the beginning in order to fill in the missing info once I feel like I'm invested enough in what I'm reading. Hah happens paragraph by paragraph to me. I went to a speed-reading camp when I was little and that seemed to help. Normally people read at a pace that is similar to their speaking rate. But most people can read much faster than that. It helps to put your finger or a pencil on the page and you'll surprise yourself at how quickly you can read if you keep your finger moving at a constant rate. The reason is because half a sentence can trip someone up and cause them to reread it, when if they just read the entire sentence it would probably make more sense with context. 

Like if I just put this word. Read. You don't know if that's past tense, present tense or a command. Because we are context learners and benefit more from getting the whole picture first, then going back. It's better for textbook reading and boring stuff. You eventually read faster than the thoughts can intrude. Every goddamn day. Meds help but it's still an issue even with stuff I *want* to read I suggest after each sentence/paragraph, go back and think if you actually gathered the information. if not, re-read it. Keep doing it for each sentence/paragraph until you get through what you're reading. It will be tedious but you have the capability to understand the material better than neurotypicals. Use it! Not so much chapters but pages.  So often I'd get to the end of a page and realize I was thinking about something entirely different and skim back to some part I recognize and start reading from there again.

Diagnosed at 43. This happens to me often but I usually notice quickly. I only go at most a paragraph before realizing that I wasn’t paying attention.  Yeah this happens sometimes when I'm reading books. I tend to think 'wait, I didn't understand the full meaning of this one single unimportant sentence, let's read it again!' I can't speak for others, but this is one of the biggest things for me, 100%. It is SO HARD to explain, too. It's like your eyes follow along from one word to the next and your brain is processing it to a degree. But none of it makes it to your conscious thought. You're on some other track, a line of something your mind has latched onto, or maybe you've just zoned out, so now your body is doing the work, going through the motions, and your brain is playing along... but at some point you realize that you lost your awareness somewhere along the way and none of what you read has made it to your conscious thoughts, let alone your memory.

Definitely a sign of inattentive-type, if you ask me. I'm sorry... adhd is one of the worst things in my life. If it's something you're struggling with too, you have my deepest sympathy.  This happened to me just reading the title I use to read upside down, I'd have to concentrate more on what I was reading.  I find that the best way to learn this sort of material is to sit down and literally write the whole thing out in your own words as you go. You'll soon get used to which parts you can skip or thin out, and the key points you DO write down can be used as quick reference for later.

This sounds like you're going to end up not remembering it because you're rote copying, but you won't just rote copy a whole book. You'll want to find shortcuts so that you have to do less writing, and the only way to do that is to actually make sure you understand what you're reading so you can attempt to condense it. Congratulations, you just tricked your brain into focusing. So many books they made you read at school I'd have this happen.  Usually by chapter 3 I'd realize I don't know who a certain character is, or that I have no idea what is actually going on.  Starting over was to daunting. I've been diagnosed for 3 decades. Medicated or not some stuff is just boring. Other stuff I can't put down. Maybe ADHD is part of the problem but remember - not everything that's been written deserves to be read. 

It becomes easier as you age out of academics and start to read because you want to, not because you have to. I probably finish 1 in every 3 books I start but I have no regrets. 

Oh, and audiobooks. God bless audiobooks.  I used to have a real problem with this back in school. Now that I only read for pleasure it only happens when a book is boring me.  I can read a bunch of pages and forget how far back I can remember and turn a few pages back looking for the last thing I remember.. Yes. It's normal for us. Dude same. For me it feels like my brain is overloaded with the words and information and at some point I space out and everything feels blank in my head. It’s like a fog. I have to take a minute to reboot. And sometimes I can’t continue. Makes cramming in last minute study time impossible. All. the. time. Only if I intentionally write down what I wrote- will I absorb anything.  I’ve learned that when it comes to learning, videos are the only thing that really stick with me. I literally can’t learn shit from reading.  That's typical of reading. At any age. This still happens to me. I'm 31 and in college. You just have to remind yourself to read and understand what you're reading. I have to reread things still. Not because I don't understand, but because of my wandering mind  Yup I have this also, master of unfinished books. Does medication help with this???  I used to have this issue, and I still do if I have to read with my eyes. If I listen to an audio book though, I can sometimes adjust the speed to 1.25, so it goes fast enough for my level of patience, without loss of fidelity, and then I can have my hands busy to keep the go go go part of my brain occupied. I stopped missing important parts of books. It is a little harder for studying, but there are textbooks that have audio versions, and there are text to speech functions that dont sound awful for ebooks. I read on reddit last night the suggestion to read while listening to the audio book at twice the speed. This is not applicable to scientific literature (due to there being no audio books), but could be worth a try for other books.  THATS WHATS HAPPENING TO ME RIGHT NOW. I just read a 30page chap for my psych class and realized I didn’t actually grasp anything at all I just read... 
It sucks because reading takes me extra long because I’m a slow reader, so just spent an hour “reading” so I could take this 12 question written exam, and do homework elaborating on 5 videos on the subject and using “information from the book” to discuss about the videos...
AND I HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER HOUR REREADING THE SAME THING I JUST TRIED TO READ. 
UGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! 
 There was a post a few days ago that claimed doors worked like memory loss triggers, which is why you sometimes walk into another room and forget what you were about to do.

I have the same with flipping to a new page.  This happens to me during conversations that I’m actually part of.  Lol it happened to me with your title just itself ... so typical.  I have never gotten to the chapter point, 

Most common is I read a paragraph, then read the same one... over and over until i realize that i made no progress put it down and try again later

less common i get through 2-3 pages, then hit a paragraph that references something that just happend and realize this is working, move my bookmark back and try again later There are so many books that I read in childhood that I simply walked my eyes over the pages and in hindsight don't really remember the plots. I've been thinking of giving them a re-read.... This happens pretty frequently for me.    Especially if i have no intrest in what I'm reading. Adult in school here. This happens to me quite a bit. I have also found a bit of correlation between how much sleep I'm getting and how well I can focus on reading. If I get 8 hours of restful sleep a night, I tend to have better concentration skills. I've been using a fitbit to help remind me when to go to bed, and to track my actual sleep with positive results. Hope that helps! >My mind usually starts wandering as soon as I start reading. It goes blank and my eyes follow the lines on the page but it's like I don't remember anything I am reading.

I frequently did this as a kid and as an adult before medication, and it was especially prominent in university, all the way up to my masters degree material. One issue there was that I had a lot of material that we all had to read, I wasn't necessarily as interested in it or I lacked a context for the material, so my retention did suffer.

These days, I am in a PhD program and I am also medicated. For the hard reading, when I'm zoning out, I will go task switch (which, let's be honest, can involve procrastinating on Reddit or elsewhere on the Internet). I do encounter hard material frequently, but it's mostly by choice - much of it is statistical literature for my dissertation, and I do have the luxury of having a dataset that I can attempt to apply the papers to. So, learning by doing really works for me. I bet it works for many of us.

If you don't have the luxury of being somewhere where you learn by doing, but you do have to read something that's causing you to zone out, then others have already given you sage advice on how to cope. Yup, sometimes I have te read a line ten times before I actually notice what it says.  *Cries* I thought that was semi normal!!! Yes, this is actually what prompted my parents to get me tested as a kid. It was the cause of soooo much frustration, anger, and failed classes in school.  I have the same problem. And whenever my teacher tells me to stand up and read loudly. I just read loudly and can't understand a single that I just read. I don't even know where my mind is wandering at that time.  >Try summarizing each paragraph into 3-4 words in the margins.

TY so much for this practical tips. I need those because my mind was blanking at what I was supposed to do while "annotating" :) To go further, what aids in memory retention is the process of “effortful recall”. After summarizing a few sections, close the book or look away, and try to remember the summaries you’ve written down and how those points relate to what came before. 

It’s important that you don’t have access to the source material during this recall exercise. the recall should feel difficult, and that’s ok. Going back to a section after trying to remember and failing is part of what creates the long term memories.

Part of what we struggle with in ADHD is a low tolerance for frustration. Unfortunately, the difficulty necessary in effortful recall also generates frustration! 

Just know that frustration and learning go hand in hand - experiencing frustration is usually taken as a sign that we are failing at the task, but in truth it’s actually a sign that we are exerting mental effort and failing at recall, which is very necessary for durable learning! Yes! This! Reading a textbook would take ages, so now I have a notebook where I draw a messy map of what I’m learning as I read it, and talking to myself while learning is helpful too. I've been struggling to finish a book I really want to read because my mind waders. I going to try this.  Without medication, I wasn't even able to get any info into my working memory, never mind annotating.  You are a goddamn saint.. I tell this to my students but rarely do it myself. What you say is true. Thanks for the reminder that we need to continually practice metacognition. I've done the same thing- if the topic I'm reading about isn't of interest to me (so if it was for a class I had to take or whatever) then while I'm trying to read my brain won't absorb the material that I'm reading. 

Along with the tips from [Gandalfandbilbo2018](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gandalfandbilbo2018), another thing I have found that helps is if you can access the reading as an audio book & find mindless things to do with your hands (like doing the dishes or cleaning) I have found that I absorb reading better that way. This method is really helpful for when I really want to curl up with a good book, however I can't focus on the reading because my brain is in overdrive thinking about all the things I should be doing other than reading. As a student whose teacher preached annotation but never showed it, I could live without it Also happened to me growing up. Still happens sometimes. I was super afraid I was actually just really dumb gallavanting around as someone who was not dumb. Fear not, though,
I am able to read actual books and even graduate level physics papers - but only sometimes. When I can read, I don’t just read one chapter, but actually all the chapters. Absolutely.

I was a huge nerd reading tons of books from the school library.

Now I’ve been out of high school for a year.

After 20 pages I feel exhausted. I feel like I barely read it and even if I’m interested in the book and it’s subject I can’t focus like I used to on it.

I don’t take ADHD medication anymore so I don’t know if that has any relation though. mentioned in another comment, but for me, Audio book + text (physical book or my wife's Kindle) has been really helpful at tackling the books I have always wanted to read but had difficulty sitting down and reading. Plus, audio books while doing other fairly mindless things helps me actually get them done, like cleaning and cooking _Sometimes_. I was reading a children's book to one of my kids, and part way through, he asked why a character in the book did something, and I had no idea what I had just read, out loud. My mind went elsewhere, but the words kept flowing. Didn't realize one could do that.  Ive found that even just slightly mouthing the words helps me a fair bit  This helps me. Sometimes I even type out the pages... I tried this at university, but seems like I am actually very good at reading out loud without picking up the content.  My school librarian sister has always has lots of audio books and graphic novels for those less able to enjoy books of only printed words, particularly ADHD and dyslexic kids. She’s a big believer in finding a way for anyone to access a story and always tells the kids, “Find the way that works best for YOU.” It’s really opened a whole new world for a bunch of them. Whatever works! 

 Oh, what do you take? Can you describe what changes for you when you take them? Do you take other meds?

Feel fre to PM.

I am waiting for a meeting with a psychiatrist and the wait is killing me. I have been on antidepressants on and off for 6 years and I don't think they are helping any and the side effects are killing me. Knowing that other medicine exist and might help me give me the strength to get out of bed in the morning.  same here!  For me, I don't think speed reading would help given that I already read fast.  It's just as if my brain shifts focus to my thoughts instead of a "boring and slow book". The words get in, they just don't get the attention they deserve. This is giving me some hope :) It's even worse when writing. It reads like word salad and I get stuck in between ideas and the resulting moodge podge is not impressing anybody... This is the only way reading works for me with regards to clear recall.  [deleted] Yes. All the chapters. So true.  Oh yes!! I would read several chapters only to realize that I was reading but zoned out...couldn’t remember anything....I do this driving too. 

As far as “fit the type”, you would be very surprised at what ADHD actually includes...it’s not just bouncing off the walls...there are A LOT of other things that go with it that surprised me...when I started reading about it all I felt so much better knowing it was apart of ADHD and not that I was crazy (well.... 🤣). Look up RSD....anger issues....lying as a child....trouble sleeping/waking up....oh the list goes on and on  All of them My english teacher has ADD and he always made us do this. I dont know if it was cause he was lazy or what but every book we read he would either put on a audio book version or read it in his loud... LOUD voice to keep us attentive. It honestly helped a lot, as I normally end up looking summaries of the book 5 minutes before a test, but I actually was able to remember what was happening in the book. Btw I have this problem with meditation too. I'm doing the exercises mentioned in audio/video like breathing and focusing on my shoulders , or focusing to different sounds around me but my mind can still wander at the same time. Weird shit Antidepressants notoriously do not work with adhd but that is just my opinion. I take vyvanse but I have trialled all adhd meds other than strettera and changed for different reasons, it's been no easy road. 

I also have PMDD and BPD(feel free to google) which make medicating my ADHD very very touchy and difficult as adhd exacerbate both these conditions. My pmdd(hormone related female disorder) is now treated with a contraceptive, and my BPD with DBT intensive therspy and I have retried vyvanse and now with those factors taken out it is going brilliantly. 

I honestly can't say the amount of things it changes. It's mind blowing I'm not going to lie. 
I do not feel constantly irritated or bored and a sense of calm I've never felt is just washed over me. I kept a job comfortably for a year when I never have, as soon as I was medicated, and within a month of quitting meds I quit my job so that says a lot. 

They calm me, make me less irritable and aggressive toward my partner and family, I can keep hobbies and do them for a while and not feel bored, and my life doesn't feel pointless and hopeless anymore. I am more engaged in conversation, I don't cut people off when they talk as much, and I can read or hear paragraphs and remember what they were about. 

They are life changing. It's a hard road, don't expect to try one med and it just work. It took me 12 months to get my meds down and I fully quit meds then retried but it is purely life changing.  My girlfriends dyslexia and confusing left and right dissappears on ritalin until it wears off.  I know, right? But hey, we’ll manage and we’re all awesome :)) I just got my diagnosis a few weeks ago and I wrote a [blog post](https://adhdinwoman.wordpress.com/2018/06/16/background-how-i-got-my-adhd-diagnosis/) about it, I hope it helps a bit. The website is still under construction, sorry for any weird-looking bits. Not committing to the paid wordpress until I prove to myself I can keep it up for at least a month haha.  For me: medication is good, but it's part of the process. I can go days without medication, and I feel a lot more useless, but understanding and applying coping mechanisms while in the medication is the main part of my treatment. I'm therapy because of the oh-holy-trinity-of-hell (adhd, depression, anxiety), and while it is kinda helping (it is that Freudian one, I forgot the name), maybe behaviorist would be better (I can't switch right now).  It's different for everyone. Without meds, I personally am not able to function at work (where I'm responsible to structure my tasks by myself, and where I have to keep my attention focused on boring tasks). I tested it again and again (often by just forgetting to take my meds). At school however, I had zero problems, as long as I sat in the front row, where my attention wasn't divided much. School only became difficult in the very last year when I had to read a lot by myself for history exams, and when I had to do a project by myself. I wasn't able to structure the work at all, and focus on a task without external guidance.  I feel your pain. 

*sits down to meditate*
*mind wanders and remembers something I need to do in the other room*
*gets up and heads in the direction of that thing*
*likely forgets why I went in particular room*
*remembers an hour later that I had sat down to meditate*

The struggle is real

Edit: spelling  Thanks. This brought tears to my eyes. Good ones.


 Do you mind clarifying what you mean about taking 12 months to get your meds down and then fully quit? 
Do you mean like, you finally found what meds helped most and then you stopped taking them? Or do you mean you finally found the right medication and then quit everything else? Or something else? Sorry, I’m just curious as I am considering changing meds from Concerta as I don’t feel like it helps me much, but I’ve never tried anything else before. [deleted] >the oh-holy-trinity-of-hell (adhd, depression, anxiety)

This is exactly what I've been struggling with- if you ever need to talk hit me up! Psychoanalysis  It's a big hard journey but it's worth it, I promise you. I was diagnosed at 24 and I am 26 next month and it's been the craziest worst and best year of my life but I promise you it's life changing if you can be patient. Feel free to PM me, it's something I'm very passionate about now. I feel like I finally woke up after 24 years. The fog clears.  That's okay, I actually got about 3 months into every med and ended up suicidal (due to my other untreated conditions) so I actually quit all meds for about 4/5 months. I ended on Vyvanse which was by far the best med for me and it was working but making me overly analytical and emotional due to my untreated Borderline Personality Disorder, and I was also in an abusive household so that was contributing to a lot of stress that I was probably blaming Vyvanse for if that makes sense. I was having an intensely bad drop from Vyvanse also, every evening and became suicidal. It was horrible honestly. 

So I quit all meds, went into intensive therapy for my BPD, treated my hormone disorder(adhd meds can screw with or be affected by hormones etc), and sorted out my gut health (mental heath and meds are soooo reliant and affected by gut health) as I have a cow milk allergy so I finally properly cut that out and let my gut heal, and started taking multivitamins and some vitamins and supplements that promote and help ADHD, mental health and general health. I did a lot of research and these things are totally overlooked but make a huge difference. 

and I have recently started Vyvanse again. It is going brilliantly with hardly any of the negative affects of before because my comorbid conditions have been treated and managed.  Hah, yes, that's the main problem, isn't it... I'm capable of rambling on forever but getting through the posts is a nightmare! Going to go back and try to edit at some point, I think, maybe just keep the properly long-form ones just for me.  This, thank you!  Glad to hear everything is going well now! Thanks for the reply, I’ll have to have a look into other options. I would definitely opt for behavioural therapy if you want to work on your ADHD.
In my view and experience, psychoanalysis is more suitable for individuals who are highly functioning and able to manage their everyday life to their own satisfaction, but feel empty / unhappy inside.  Yeah. I highly recommend not overlooking things like comorbid conditions and gut health and vitamin deficiencies, they make so much more difference than people give them credit for. And a huge difference on how well your meds can help  I'm moving cities, I'll look for it. I'm not really happy with my therapist, she always talks about god and such, I'm an atheist, she knows, but still insists.  Doesn't sound like they are a good therapist anyway, Religion/atheism shouldn't play any role in therapy unless you have particular issue with it.
