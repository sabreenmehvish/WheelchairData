How do you guys relax, reboost your energy, etc Im in university, my dream is to get a 3.7 average.. but to even maintain a gpa of 3.4 to 3.55 I need to work/study about 60 to 80 hours a week. 

I feel stressed all the time, and I find it tough to get a little peace when I'm on any adhd stimulants. Actually it is best if I follow a routine of 2 days on, and one day off of ~7.5mg dexedrine spanulses. If I take it daily my brain power goes to shit, my performance sucks, I get quite the brain fog, I'm irritable, and so on.

How would do you guys reduce your stress if you're really exerting yourself? Honestly, the only time I can ever relax is if I go far from home and am incapable of doing the things I would need to if I'm home.

&#x200B;

There are always a million things hanging over me, house shit, school shit, bills, work shit, etc... all that need done, none that I want to, all that pile on stress. My only escape is to literally leave everything for several days, leaving behind laptop / work / etc. and then it fades over 2 - 3 days until I can actually just relax.

&#x200B;

but by then I am normally starting to stress about going back. Its a terribly viscous circle, I really never relax, I'm almost done with school finally, and looking to hopefully move in a few months... so then I'll only be stressing over work (hopefully)

&#x200B;

also: you are the only one that gives a fuck about your GPA. The vast majority of graduate programs just require a 3.0+ and if you aren't planning on doing a graduate degree, then you just need to pass. Literally nobody sees a difference between 3.7 and 3.4 anywhere, at any time with the exception of maybe getting accepted to a graduate program. Future employers will never even ask about your GPA. Your GPA will never come up in conversation, you will never be asked to provide an employer a copy of your college transcripts... literally nobody gives a shit. A 3.7 is a B. a 3.4 is a B. a 3.0 is a B, and a 3.9 is a B. Do not stress over it

There is an old joke: What do you call the call the guy who graduated with lowest GPA in his medical school class? Doctor Warm herb teas, warm baths, weighted blankets, maybe weed. Vodka. Too much vodka. It's a problem. But I'm working on it.  Relax with benzos and antipsychotics. Adderall 80mg a day for energy. RNR. Unless on tolerance break.  Yoga classes work for me.  Avoid alcohol, ask your psychiatrist about Modafinil. Changed my life.

ETA: DO NOT take amphetamines of any kind with Modafinil.  While this is true, I'm in the exact same boat but struggling through an Engineering program at a good university (surprised I was even able to get here), dumping my 60-80 hour weeks trying to even get to a 3.0 but barely below atm. Goal is ultimately to do a BS/MS +1 year program.  
 4th year anniversary of burnout, finally got diagnosed with an extreme ADHD inattentive, hope to try a medication by the end of the month. The stress seems to amplify the symptoms a lot.   
 Even barely taking the minimum course load seems too much at this point, and it is extremely frustrating.  


 I have to remind the kids here that the GPA ultimately only matters to their grad school admissions or if they are trying to go to a big 5 tech company with no work experience just after graduating. (work experience will always trump GPA in all cases, even if just a club project) but I'm barely cutting it myself, if i can even say that.  
 Interesting, so you physically remove yourself. Maybe I will incorporate an hour or two of walking again. I can see how a full day or two could work but I dont know how practical this is for me at thid time in my life.

As for the gpa, I have the belief that being able to obtain a higher gpa as an undergrad can increase my chances of obtain scholarship(s). I agree with what you say, but idk.. I just feel it's a good idea to really try and obtain the highest grades I can. I did not know weighed blankets were a thing now, thats a cool concept. Weed is something I'm definitely considering Numb from too much sake, checking in.... 80mg of adderall I think would ruin me, but I'll read more info about benzo's Do you find a diffdrence between a yoga class and doing yoga by yourself?

I havent tried yoga in a group, my first impression is that it might help comparedmdo doing yoga at home by myself I took modafinil briefly for narcolepsy (I had severe sleep apnea) and it also had the amazing side effect of helping me get shit done. Now if only I'd figured out back then I needed to get my ADHD diagnosed.... wait.. what?

" [Modafinil](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16962/modafinil+oral/details) reduces extreme sleepiness due to [narcolepsy](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/narcolepsy) and other [sleep disorders](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm), such as periods of stopped breathing during [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm) ([obstructive sleep apnea](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/understanding-obstructive-sleep-apnea-syndrome)). It is also used to help you stay awake during work hours if you have a work schedule that keeps you from having a normal [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-sleep-disorders-overview) routine (shift work [sleep disorder](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm))."

&#x200B;

and " Though it helps many people, this medication may sometimes cause [addiction](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/default.htm).  This risk may be higher if you have a substance use disorder (such as  overuse of or addiction to drugs/alcohol). Take this medication exactly  as prescribed to lower the risk of addiction. Ask your doctor or  pharmacist for more details." .. people with ADHD are like WAY more likely to be addicts, especially alcohol 

&#x200B;

and the OP is on " dexedrine 7.5 mg"... the full name for it is " Dextroamphetamine" ... it literally has  amphetamine in the name . Have you considered reducing your course load? I'm not sure where you are going, but 12 credits is considered full time.  That is either either 3 specialized courses, or 4 gen eds. If you focus on the specialized courses during the semester, you can leave the stupid garbage waste of money piles of shit fucking trash courses for summer. (I clearly feel very strongly towards gen ed courses) for summer or winter sessions, and hopefully reduce the work load

&#x200B; Rum and Whiskey here. Idk it's what worked for me , there isn't really a certain level of the dosage either. I have co-workers that some get 120-140mg scripted a month. I'll never go past 80mg. 4 times a day is good enough for me , and I try to keep dependency low. 


Definitely be safe with benzos , once your on that path you'll definitely become dependent and than you just gotta keep things in check mentally and stay disciplined with them and use only when truly needed. 

Overall, I think you'll learn and find out from what you read - to your MD and get on a legit treatment plan. Wish you the upmost best ! üòá‚úåüèª Yes! Because in class I actually go and someone makes me do difficult things slowly for one hour.. I think if I did at home myself I would probably give up after 15 minutes and not try as hard.

Plus the novelty of a new environment is good for adhd focus.

I spent an entire night up on Saturday and after Sunday morning yoga I slept like a baby mid day. Would highly recommend. Yeah I'm aware. I'm recommending an alternate regimen to the OP. Because OP isn't gonna get what he is asking for on amphetamines. If I was you I would get all fucking mad over people recommending alcohol. Cause speedballs are super healthy? I was a transfer from a community college, so only program coursework exists for my pathway. In general, half of the classes are considered high intensity and a typical student would expect 10-20 hrs a week for entirely (or 5-11 hrs for smart/quick kids), while I hash out 40 hrs+ outside of even studying (I blame the burnout more than anything).  


 So far I've gone a year with a trend of dropping 1 course midway, down to 2 courses per quarter and barely meeking out results with 1 high intensity course and a secondary course. Running out of secondary courses now, but finally making headway with the diagnosis. Honestly if I keep up pulling down to under full time, I'll probably get kicked out of my housing situation, so overall a bad time.  
 It was like reading a perfect character profile of everything in my life spelled out between symptoms, naturally developed coping mechanisms, and reading through other people's stories and experiences. (32 yr/male, had a lot of building up natural coping mechanisms and feeling like an absolutely a sub-par human for a long time.) So hoping medication helps mitigate symptoms and helps the burnout, i figure 50% mitigation per symptom would be a drastic success, but every little bit would be a godsend for me at this point.  


 I have no doubts i can finish the B.S. degree, which for my experiences is a huge milestone - but still trying to make that grad school objective and doing my best. Its unfortunate that GPA will be the lead mitigating factor, but even with the minimum GPA, I could probably pull half a dozen letters of reccommendation by now. I lead a lot of my peers in study groups and motivation... just not in ability to do harshly timed tests or elaborate work.
