Advice on improving reading comprehension? Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm sure most of you can relate, but I'm someone who can read a whole chapter then not be able to tell you anything that happened in the chapter. I'm handing this in undergrad, but I'm really worried about grad school, when classes are smaller and it'll be much more obvious that I don't comprehend the readings.

Does anyone have any advice for improving your reading comprehension as someone with ADHD? Thanks everyone. I’m the opposite, I can’t tell you anything that has just been said in a conversation. I put the subtitles on the tv I can actually understand what’s going on. Maybe try listening to whatever your reading at the same time, it might help it go in better! i think it’s a matter of interest a lot of the time. if i’m reading an article on something i’m in to, I gobble it up like it’s nothing. but if it’s something i really don’t care at all about/am being forced to read i can stare at a paragraph for 5 mins and get nothing. the best solution i’ve found so far is just finding a way to make it interesting to trick myself into becoming invested. I don’t know if it’s the best work around because usually whatever i thought about to make the reading interesting will dominate most of my thoughts, and the text will be read in relation to whatever that is
