The only way I could learn is by reading books instead of learning from the computer If I were learning from the computer, I would have about 100 tabs open and reading reddit all day. So, I got an idea! I went to value village and look for programming books like Java,Python, and etc. So far, I am on page 30 and going to turn up my laptop and try some coding then get off and read more.
