How do you feel reading comments on posts or videos about adhd on YouTube and social media? Whenever I see something about adhd usually I'm super happy (unless it's mean), but then I go to the comments and it hurts me a lot to see how uneducated and rude people are. I begin to hyperfocus and read a bunch of comments which makes me even more sad and angry. I'm amazed by how many people think that spanking is enough to help and all adhd people and they should be taken off of their meds. Be it ADHD or any other topic, going bellow the line to the comments is always going to reveal the utter dregs of society... There is a clear correlation between ignorance, stupidity, and a desire to share this with the world It's depressing. People can be jerks. ADHD is not something to joke about.
