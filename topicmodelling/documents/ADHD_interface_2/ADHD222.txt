Lets all share our ADHD hacks, tips, and techniques! Some of my ADHD management techniques are constant reminders on my phone and sticky notes on my mirror for extra reminders. What about you?  1) Never try to write an essay after 5 p.m.  My best writing happens early in the day.

2) Once the TV goes on, no valid work is going to occur.  

3) The best academic work is not even accomplished at home, because that's where I relax and play.  It's done at the library. 1. Do shit in the morning. Get up and fucking do it or it won't get done. Bonus, it will make you feel like a productive, task-achieving badass the rest of the day. 
2. Get enough sleep. Don't sit on reddit until 2 am, go to bed early. 
3. Feed your brain. You *can* survive on only gummy worms, but you *shouldn't*. Eat foods that will actually fuel your brain, it's crazy how it will improve your brain fog. 
4. Wunderlist is the best app ever. Tasks, due dates, sublists, organization. It is the only thing that has gotten me through school, and I own like 208403 paper planners. And put things in it. Don't say "oh i'll remember that" because you won't. 
5. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. Prioritize yourself! Don't get into the cycle of doing nothing then feeling like shit for doing nothing. Wash your face before bed, brush your teeth twice a day. Remind yourself how good you are doing!  [deleted] \- POMODORO METHOD

\- exercise before working helps me focus better

\- No devices that will serve as a distraction (cell phone, tablet, Nintendo, etc) unless you need it for working

\- COFFEE. I know it's not the best option, but as a person who can't get medicated, this is the most accessible type of stimulant I can get.

\- Take full advantage of calendar apps with notifications. I write all my events and tasks in to Samsung's calendar app and it's a lifesaver because it has notifications

Anyone have any advice on how to avoid the temptation of googling random things while working on your laptop? Not really a management technique, more of a medication thing. But using phenibut to manage anxiety, insomnia, and lack of appetite from Vyvanse has literally changed my life. 

I'm able to be productive and focused without really feeling cracked out or on edge. I really hate the feeling of Vyvanse on it's own, and used to dread days I had to take it to be productive. Unfortunately the dosage of phenibut I need isn't sustainable on a daily basis but feeling motivated and productive 3 days a week without horrible side effects has been incredible.

I'm not advocating this for anyone else, and you should really consult a doctor for your own situation. There definitely are serious risks associated with phenibut, namely it's addictive potential, tolerance buildup, bad withdrawls, and dangerous interactions with alcohol. I also have depression and anxiety along with adhd (non hyperactive though). But this has allowed me to meaningfully manage my adhd at least on days I really need it for the first time in my life. Keep a notepad with you to write down what is helpful and reinforce them over and over again Well, I'm starting this mindfulness workbook per my therapist so I'll let you know how it goes...it seems awfully silly. "Imagine a river floating by and notice all your thoughts flowing down it and then them flowing away..." -\_- Reading- I just bought an Oasis kindle. I avoided for the longest time because I hate reading on screens but I've been loving it.

One of my BIGGEST issues with reading is I constantly get fascinated by words, when I come across a new word I need to get my phone out and research the meaning....then the black hole ensues...and I've lost track of time...and now I dont remember what I was actually reading.

With my kindle I can immediately just highlight the word (and save it!) And look up the definition *as I'm reading* and since my oasis doesnt have an awful glare it still feels like reading a book. I also dont loose every bookmark I've ever owned! And I can switch books around more easily but I can also come back to the book I've abandoned more easily because bookmarking where I actually stopped is 100% easier and I have no way of actually losing my place then having to read the whole book over again (that is unless I've abandoned it so long I still have to re-read it...sigh). I've only had it two days and haven't been able to explore it fully yet but it's been great. I keep a bullet journal and grade myself everyday and write what I can improve. At the end of the week I compile it, at the end of the month I compile that. It helps me feel less stressed (which worsens the ADHD) if I feel a little bit accomplished or organized. Conversely, getting an F at life everyday can be a little disheartening. I try to use my grade as motivation though. It’s not super accurate bc I always forget to chart what I’ve done but it’s atleast helped a bit.

Also, carrying around that stupid book stops you from forgetting. I’ve conditioned myself so that I pick it up when I have nothing to do, come home, or stop to eat and then I remember oh! I have stuff to do. 1. Take notes. Keep a little notepad and pen (not digital because out of sight out of mind is real). Dont be shy, take notes during conversations. 
2. Make lists. With prioritizing hierarchy. Determine what needs to get done before you can relax and get whatever done whenever.
3. Slow down. Preface conversations prior to jumping into your thought...rarely are other people following the same path your brain took.
4. Retrack your thoughts whenever you find yourself going down the rabbit hole. "How the hell did I get here?!" Is actually a really fun journey.

I hope this helps you some. It's basically the only way I've been able to be mildly successful in my life... White Noise or just loud noise of some kind. I can focus better with a conversation in the background than any other way. 1. Audio books. I especially like Scribd.
2. Speechify app to voice read paper textbooks and electronic texts.
3. Apps to stay away from phone: MarsCraft, Forest.
4. Regular TODO lists and task-managers newer work for me. Gamified task-managers such as Habitica are much better.
5. Mindfulness meditation. I'm using Calm website and app.
6. Sleep 8 hours EVRY day. Ask your doctor for insomnia medication. Take your pill (I'm taking Belsomra), start another tree to grow (see 3), sleep.
7. Protein breakfast. Several eggs, oats, a spun or two of oil, salt. Put in a bowl and stir, microwave several minutes. I've tried many.  
I have a 4×2m (13'×6'6" for you people who die of cheaply treatable diseases) whiteboard in my most used room.  Update tasks, events and information on it, keep it rolling forward and it's a looming indication of life  If you are making a follow up or next appointment for a medical visit, put it in your phone while talk to the receptionist. Set the reminder to a day in advance, and then an hour in advance. If you're like me and the ADHD mainly manifests in forgetfulness, you need to write shit down IMMEDIATELY. Keep a notepad or notes in your phone. Any time you want to do something but can't do it immediately, make it a habit to write it down, and then check back hourly/daily. If you’re in a writing heavy course and have an upcoming assignment, talk to your professor about having a ‘draft deadline.’ I get anxious when a deadline approaches, so it helps me focus on getting it done. If I procrastinate until the last second, I can pull an all-nighter and try to get it done. If it’s good, you’ll have time before the deadline to finalize it. If it’s not, you have a base to work from. And if you forget about it completely, you still have an actual deadline to have a second chance.  1. Use bright white paper for notes, especially for materials that require visualization.
2. Make your desktop or phone background your calendar or schedule.
3. Dress for success, if you need to study or work on something dress professional even if you are sitting at home. * **Adjustable pomodoro timer:** I have mine set to 12 minutes on 3 minutes off, since that’s the level at which I experience only moderate resistance to starting one. During the break I stop working and review what I’ve done in the last pomodoro and what I plan to do in the next one.

* **Task anxiety explanation:** if I am consistently procrastinating on something I sit for a moment and write out what makes me afraid of the task. It usually boils down to fear of failure or fear of disappointing a respected person. I intellectually compare the strategy of doing nothing to the strategy of taking action, and 99% of the time it’s immediately clear that doing anything is better than doing nothing. I'm new, so a few things I have been.

1. Sticky notes. Write what I remember
2. Write any and all down. Copious notes!
3. Plan my work day out in outlook. I've the best week at work in a long time.
4. Bought this journal. Plan to transition to this soon as I have to learn it.
5. If I think of it. Do immediately. 1) Utilize google assistant. If an important reminder/task pops into your head while your hands and eyes are dedicated to something else, like driving: "okay google, write this down..." Mine is set to start a note in google keep. This also ensures that you won't dwell on the possibility of forgetting the reminder, which could be a hazardous distraction while navigating traffic. 

2) In the morning, stay within reasonable distance of an accessible washroom during the window that your stimulants first kick in. 1. I write every event on google calendar. Everything must be up. I also have to check it every morning and I can’t assume to remember what I have noted. Always check. Sometimes I still mess up by writing the wrong dates and stuff but whatever.
2. If I need to do academic work I have to study alone unless for discussion. 
3. Scrolling reddit helps me sleep. I battle to get enough sleep. My mind is always awake when it shouldn’t be. Reddit helps apparently!
 This is more of a lifestyle change but I stopped eating sugar and carbs, made my ADHD about 70% better. Im even concidering quitting meds after that change but I do not know if I can resist the urge of eating sugar and carbs without my meds. Hard call to make.  I find that doing homework in a school like environment motivates me to get work done. Going to a library has helped me a lot.  It’s more like never write before 5 pm, as it gets later the writing gets better for me. I'm the same way. I cannot be home if I need to work on something.   > Wash your face before bed, brush your teeth twice a day.

Dammit, I'm going. Thank you very much. Even if it's just tonight it's more than usual and that's worth it.  Ironically I’m reading this a 1:45 am when I have to wake up early tomorrow to finish packing/painting my apartment to move out. Another Wunderlist fan here!! Also, I've just been introduced to Trello which looks like it has potential. It's much more visual than Wunderlist.  May I ask what kind of art you do and put into a portfolio? I have started designing custom invitations and really need to get all the products I have made thus far together! I feel like I’ve done nothing but really have so much to showcase.  >Anyone have any advice on how to avoid the temptation of googling random things while working on your laptop?

This is probably my main problem while studying. In my case, I frequently study from books but have a laptop on the side to put music and a pomodoro app (Be Focused) and every page from what I am reading has something that makes me want to search on the web out of curiosity. This could be good but a big part of those searches end up derailing on 8 website tabs which consumes so much time and even makes me procrastinate for hours.   


What seems to work for me is to avoid those in-between searches at all and just type them on a stickie note app on my laptop or any piece of paper so that I can relax and know that I can do the search on another time, just not now. Not sure it would help you, but there are programs and extensions tjat block stuff for a certain period of time.   there’s a Pomodoro timer i use on chrome called Strict Workflow to block sites during my work intervals (25 mins work- 5mins break) so i don’t dick around when i’m supposed to be working. It can be used to block certain sites only which is what i like cuz i need to use google images to do my job (artist) but i cant procrastinate waste time on sites i usually do that on like reddit or tumblr. 

i also tend to focus more with ambient noises as well so Coffitivity is good for that. It’s an app and an extension where it plays gentle ambient/white noise stuff  I keep a notepad with me where I write down everything I want to google that doesn’t involve the task at hand ( I use this with the pomodoro method) then I google it later during the break What's your phenibut dosage? How many times a week do you take it? That's great that you're able to use it in control. For me, phenibut is in that class of drugs where I have zero control over my usage. The only way I don't abuse it for more than a week is when I just dump the remaining powder down the toilet. For that alone I've had to completely quit phenibut.

One of the worst parts of ADHD for me is the mind-numbing boredom that follows me every minute of the day. I used to think my drug usage was something along the lines of "I take drugs because I'm so depressed and empty" which is still kinda true, but the main reason is something more like " I take drugs to at least forget or escape the incredible boredom of day to day life. Thankfully Adderall/Vyvanse has helped a lot with curbing drug cravings, at least until they wear off.

So while I would try to get high on whatever is possible, phenibut takes the cake to be quite honest. I mean it's legal and easy to order online, cheap and possibly one of the best substances I've ever taken. At higher doses I would feel like I was becoming almost manic. I hear that Vyvanse/Adderall make these recreational benefits go up by 100x. Some phen users call it "God mode," which I can see because Adderall and phenibut by themselves already give me an inflated ego. I can't imagine them together. Anyway sorry for the long post. I'm sure you know all the risks and addiction potential with phenibut, especially since you have ADHD. Good idea!  I use my notes app, and then lose the file.  That is still better than my old method of writing it down and losing the pad. :) If it helps, I don't picture an actual river. I just treat my thoughts like a river, if that makes sense; let them come in and let them go without holding on to them. It is not easy at first, and you'll find yourself caught up in thoughts all the time. That's normal. Just catch yourself, and release the thought without judgement. Ultimately, you'll gain greater control over your mind and attention. Like anything worth doing, it's not easy, and it takes practice, but absolutely anyone can do it. Good luck! It takes a while for mindfulness to really click. It took me years of knowing it was a good thing, and then I had a panic attack a few times (anxiety isnt my main issue but for reasons I was struggling around a certain time) and since my SO practiced mindfulness I decided to give it a try since he constantly mentioned I should start, and after a lot of consistency and practice, it just started to "click" and I recognized how helpful it could be. For me, and most people I would say, it's not 100% all the time but it can give you a momentary pause in your thoughts that can help and give you perspective. (Just taking a step back and recognizing the situation or the thought patterns).

The whole visualization thing does nothing for me though which is why when I was introduced to mindfulness years ago it never helped. For me it's more about breaking up thought patterns and letting my brain have at least one moments peace. And breathing, which also never clicked for me until one day it did. 

I'm not sure about you and others but visualization doesnt help for me, I suppose with ADHD it creates more thoughts more vividness and expectations on my brain. I either thought it was silly or didnt help me because my brain was already hyperactive and it just didnt actually relax me. Because...I'm still thinking and creating? Nah I just want some peace and quiet. I already daydream 90% of the time lol. Teach me something I DONT know how to do (aka keeping my brain quiet). Ow did the workbook go?  Was it mostly cheesy, or was there good stuff later on? I do the same. Look them up and then write it down! Awesome. This!! Getting a kindle was the best thing that ever happened to my reading level and enjoyment! It also reduces the amount of time I spend impuslivly buying books and going to bookstores, due to large amount of free content...and other methods of acquisition. Pollito de miarma bendita, échate ahí chavalalito. And now I understand a little bit of this piece. Me too!! My husband thinks I'm crazy!!! This is a great list!  A high protein breakfast makes a difference other people can notice.

Could you share a little more about your experience with Calm?  Is there a time of day that works best for you? Weird question, but how do you manage your whiteboard? I have a 2x1m board, but mine's always a mess. I just can't seem to keep it organised. My notes and papers just go all over. I use it for all kinds of things though, not just tasks. And does it pay off to have such a big board (as compared to one about my size)? love #2 and will be doing this myself I really like #1 and think I may finally start using GA. May I ask about #2 as in why? Ive recently been put on stims and had a HORRID sugar addiction, I've noticed in the past 3 days, it's nearly gone. Is this common with ADHD? (The sugar cravings) Am the same, I can't produce anything until 11pm, a real shitty situation but as long as you get results, right? You go, dudeman! One time is better than zero times. You deserve it.  Try [Lanes](http://lanes.io) if you want a combo of Wunderlist and a timer and journal. I’ll have to check it out! I love how with Wunderlist I can basically put my entire syllabus in there and I can see it on my computer and my phone. It does have its downfalls though, so Trello is downloading as we speak :)  [deleted] Tried those. Worked for a while, then I just turned them off. Kinda work for me but its really easy to find stuff to get distracted on with the internet, even if social media and games are blocked. Usually 1.5 grams, three times a week. Which is realistically at the edge if not over what responsible usage would be. But I'm a professor and have my summers off and a month off in the winter, if I have to deal with withdrawls that's a bridge I'll cross once I have some time off without serious responsibilities. I only discovered phenibut about 2 months ago but haven't had any serious tolerance issues. 

One thing about phenibut is it seems to have very different effects on different people. Honestly phenibut without Vyvanse just makes me kinda sleepy, if it's a large dose it's kind of a slightly drunk feeling. I don't have much of an addictive personality, I've messed with a lot of drugs and the only one I've used compulsively is marijuana. I haven't had any problems with going overboard with phenibut yet, but I realize it's definitely something to look out for. Some days, mindfulness meditations improve my concentration dramatically. It sweeps out unnecessary thoughts which distract my from a task. And it also helps to begin a task. I usually do not have problems with mood an anxiety but it also helps with that. 

Any time of the day but before things should be done. Ideally, right before your want to begin to do something.  There are also special meditations for bed time.

Not a panacea but worth to try their free 7 days course. I have a subscription for two and ever I'm to lazy to to Calm meditations regularly I think those money are well-spent. Nice. Sometimes of course the problem is realizing that I’m procrastinating... Stimulants get the bowels moving my friend! It is usually that your food cravings go up when you stop with meds, that is not suprising since sugar gives you a dopamin hit. Since you are running lower on dopamin from meds you compensate for that by wanting sugar. just try eating other foods to fill those cravings. Thanks! I'll have a look. I love Wunderlist too, and especially so because I can use it to make shared lists with my kids (Both adhd) to help them with stuff like packing.
But I have to admit to being wooed by the sparkly shiny that is Trello 😁. I just need some time to explore it properly. Hope it works out for you.  very good to know, I'm only on day 3 lol Yeah I really need to..thankfully the medicine really helps with that. When it wears off though, like you said it comes right back. I used to go through a bag of 17 lollipops in one night haha horrible You're welcome :) It really comes to habit I do not eat sugar. When you stop you feel horrible a few days but when you come past that you don't even want sugar anymore! But you can't cheat or you will fall back and need to pressure yourself for 3 days again to break the habit!
