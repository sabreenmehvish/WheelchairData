Is Praying impossible? Reading the Bible? I can remember as a kid (13 year olds?) at church events ANYTIME we were told to pray, I just couldn‚Äôt do it. My thoughts were all over the place.  I remember feeling like it was sinful. 

And reading the bible was IMPOSSIBLE!! (Like nearly all dense reading).  Anyone else have this experience? Please share.


 I always used to feel guilty because my mind inevitably wanders during prayer. In the end, I figured that God knows my brain better than anyone, and he probably understands. I think it‚Äôs better to pray and get distracted than to not pray at all.  So, it isn‚Äôt impossible, but it‚Äôs obviously much more difficult for people with ADHD. I feel ya entirely. 

If it helps (I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre Catholic, but this is good advice anyway) St. Francis de Sales advises to do your best. Just try. If you get distracted or your mind wanders, it‚Äôs okay. It happens, so don‚Äôt get too worked up. Just accept it happened, and gently place your heart back in front of God. Even if your prayer or Bible time is filled with you getting distracted and gently bringing yourself back, you can trust that it was productive. Remember what God said about trusting him and not worrying too! He wants you to feel safe in Him. 

Hope this helps. :) It often feels impossible to me. And it makes me feel worse when I think about how I haven't been praying or reading, because I want to but it's just so freaking hard sometimes. Have you tried maybe listening to the Bible on audio book? I loved listening to books on tape while I was commuting last year.  Think how short the Lord's Prayer is and consider that God is more interested in intent then in long drawn out flowery prayers. Yes, I experience this every time I go to church.  It feels awful, but now I understand why I do what I do, and I dont think God minds since He knows our inner-workings.  Praying takes extra effort, and sometimes I just can't do it. But God knows the heart and what we need before we ask.  

I take prayers in small doses, keeping them sort and sweet and to the point. No extras here, otherwise I'm listening to the penclicks, snuffles, feet shuffling, etc.  Sincerity and honesty is key, and by me keeping it concise I can pray without the distractions getting to me.  The only way I've ever managed to read larger portions of the Bible was by scheduling a specific reading time in my planner and using a timer, and taking notes afterward. My prayers do feel all over the place also, so I keep a prayer journal for when I happen to remember to use it. I find it easier to pray when I'm in my car where it's quiet and I'm alone. I read a lot as a kid but fell out of it in high school and college because they made us read so much stuff that I couldn‚Äôt read in my free time. I was mentally tapped. I was just diagnosed at 25 a month and a half ago and I‚Äôm reading again and loving it. I‚Äôm actually reading through the Bible for the first time in my life and am really enjoying it. The Old Testament can be a bit dense at first but once you adjust to the style it becomes easier. The great thing about the Bible is it is written in small chunks. So it‚Äôs easy to read a bit and take a break.  The other side of the coin is hyperfocus. I read the whole thing. Then I saw it for what it was.  Me and my sister were just discussing this!   
I feel guilty not being able to stay focused on my prayers or the bible! But I know it's not on purpose, I try so hard. And making time to stop and pray and read the bible? How??!  Yes, I struggled until I got older and realized that Santa, Jesus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and God were all made up to make me feel better. And then I read about how the Bible was put together, learned about its authorship, and decided to focus on more meaningful and important things in life. 

Ever wonder why your prayers are answered at the same rate as random chance?

EDIT downvotes for starting a discussion isn‚Äôt nice.  [deleted] Explain. 

How did you come to the realization that they were made up / made up to make you feel better? 

How can we say if God is real or not? 

Any data? 

Pascals Wager?  This is /r/ADHD, so yeah, probably. Sure.  There is an infinite set of things can COULD exist. Within this set an infinite subset of things that DON‚ÄôT exist,  and a much smaller subset of things that DO exist. 


{could} = {don‚Äôt} + {do}

And that‚Äôs it - everything in existence in our universe is in one of those two sets. 

So for example, there could be invisible leprechauns living in my wall that come out at night and move my remote controls, steal single socks, and eat the last cookie.

When you study the scientific method you learn that we can‚Äôt prove things - we can only support or refute. You also learn the default hypothesis is ‚ÄúX does not exist‚Äù when it comes to questioning if something is there or not. NOT ‚ÄúX exists‚Äù - because the default (or ‚Äúnull‚Äù) hypothesis is the one more easily falsified. It‚Äôs very easy to disprove ‚ÄúX doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù than ‚ÄúX exists‚Äù - just present X and there you go. Its impossible to disprove ‚ÄúX exists‚Äù without a comprehensive understanding of the entire system X is postulated to exist within. 

Therefore, the only reasonable and logical stance on belief is to assume the null hypothesis for all things until disproven. So it‚Äôs not reasonable to ask someone ‚Äúprove god doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù any more than it‚Äôs not reasonable to say ‚Äúprove there aren‚Äôt invisible leprechauns living in your walls.‚Äù  You simply can‚Äôt disprove that. 

You already don‚Äôt believe in an infinite number of things - otherwise your mind would be overwhelmed at the sheer number of incredible things you believe in despite the lack of evidence. So not believing in your god - whichever one of the infinite versions you happen to favor due to your upbringing - is just one more item in an infinite set of things. And through simple statistics, the chance YOUR god happens to be in that tiny subset of things that ‚Äúcould and do‚Äù exist instead of the ‚Äúcould but doesn‚Äôt‚Äù set is very, very low. 

The logical mindset to any belief at all therefore is that of polite skepticism until evidence is presented to the contrary. 

So, what evidence outside of other similarly limited humans telling you what to believe do you have that convinced you? I can think of many pieces of evidence that suggest the opposite. One fun place to look is the life cycles of many insects.
