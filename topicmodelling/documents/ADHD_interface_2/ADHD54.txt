How I vastly improved my passion for reading as someone with ADHD, who initially felt very impatient to read Hi friends,
I know many of you have some impatience with reading, and yet still want to get into the habit of reading for enjoyment. I have found reading to be one of my most rewarding and satisfying hobbies in my life.
Personally apart from Harry Potter and books I was forced to read for school, I hadnâ€™t really read anything much until about the age of 18. I found reading initially to be not so engaging for me, and around that age, I was a very slow reader and never quite understood the enjoyment of reading for personal satisfaction.


The first thing I learned is that if you want to build a reading habit, you have to find VERY ENGAGING books to read! If youâ€™re not feeling it as youâ€™re reading, then immediately stop reading what youâ€™re reading and move on to something else that might better engage you. There are millions and millions of books in the world to choose from.


Second of all, I began to use softwares like Spreeder Pro and QuickReader Pro on my iPad to feel more engaged with what I was reading.
Even though these are speed reading softwares, you donâ€™t necessarily have to use them for speed reading. What helped me most was to use the pacer in the software that Highlights and moves along a group of words and down the page, which allowed me to keep up the momentum of reading without regressing and going back on the page. 
In a way this made reading feel like it flowed more in my brain, and it kept me more engaged during a reading session.


I also liked how these softwares give you an estimate of how long it will take to complete a book. Over years, using these tools helped my reading a lot, and now I find that reading is one of my favorite activities, something that I didnâ€™t think was really possible when I was 18!


Accessibility: You always want to keep reading material, books, or your ereader/tablets/phones close by and accessible, so that itâ€™s not too much effort to find something to read. Personally Iâ€™m a really spontaneous person so I sort of let my intuition guide me to what to read next, but you could make lists as well. Again, just want to restate that if youâ€™re not feeling something youâ€™re reading, never force it and just let it go. Maybe itâ€™s just not the right time for that particular book, or maybe thatâ€™s just not the one for you, and thatâ€™s totally fine :)


Audiobooks: since often I feel like I always have to be doing something or moving, using audiobooks was a great discovery for me!
Lately I like to draw or sketch, or sometimes play mobile games while listening to an audiobook. Iâ€™ve noticed that this keeps me in a flow state.
Some individuals with ADHD, like the actor Will Smith, like to listen to the audiobook and read at the same time. So if the other tips donâ€™t work for you, this might!


I genuinely want to help people who are like me, find this amazing love of reading within themselves, so if my post helps even one person, Iâ€™ll be really happy :)
Itâ€™s never too late to build a habit of reading!
Good luck, and message me if you have any questions, Iâ€™ll be happy to respond


 This doesn't quite apply to me because I've been fortunate enough to have adhd but also have reading as the thing I hyperfocus on haha I'm a huuuge reader even growing up and I definitely agree about finding the right story that'll engage you! 

Also mediums like audiobooks are my lifesaver when I feel like hitting a reading slump cause I can just up the speed and get engrossed in the story faster ðŸ˜„ congrats on finding your love for reading! Do you have any amazing book recommendations? Gotta love that hyperfocus ðŸ˜‚  What kind of books do you like to read? I'm kinda sucky at recs just because I tend to forget everything when asked but I'll try ðŸ˜„ I like to read everything from self help to sci-fi to mysteries
