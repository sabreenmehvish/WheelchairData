Reading too slow Can NOT keep up Here it is WEEK ONE of school and ALREADY behind. This fun prof wants us to do the home BEFORE class. I can‚Äôt do that. I need to read it, hear it, see it - 3 mediums - AT LEAST. I often manage to find some video tutorials as well BEFORE doing the homework. What a stressful weekend I had. 1st had to read 2 chapters discussed in 1st class and attempt THOSE questions. Seriously struggling. It literally takes me 30 hours to do what‚Äôs likely ‚ÄúNORMALLY‚Äù 4 to 6 hours. And I brot home work from the office this weekend which REALLY needs to be done tomorrow for a meeting. Another class starts tomorrow night and the next prof only gave us reading and q assignment late this afternoon. That one will not happen I‚Äôm afraid. Not looking forward to next 3 months of no sleep. Oh and I think my son has measles (YES we‚Äôve been vaccinated) but he just presented with a weird rash. Squeeze dr appt for him sometime tomorrow too üò≠ Please talk to your professors! If they are good professors they want you to LEARN and the earlier you talk to them, the more likely they are to be able to help you figure something out!
