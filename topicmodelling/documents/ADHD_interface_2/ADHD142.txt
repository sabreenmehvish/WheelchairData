How do you manage technology addiction/hyper-focus on technology? Ive been using technology since I was young due to a sensorimotor disability which impacts my ability to physically write. Since then Iâ€™ve become sucked in. I hyper-focus on my phone, laptop, technology, etc. I need to find a way to cut down my usage. I get anxiety when Iâ€™m away from technology. Itâ€™s real bad. Anyone experienced anything similar? Any tips on how to cut back? Find another non-technology based hobby that you enjoy In my experience, it requires a shift in perspective regarding the purpose of technology use. Technology use *should* have a purpose, even if it's a recreational purpose.

This is what's been helping me manage my technology usage:

* Decide on a purpose or goal for using your tech *before* you start using it (ie. find study material on youtube)
* Only engage in activities that help you achieve that goal (ie. open up youtube, find most relevant videos)
* If you find yourself tempted to start an activity that's only tangentially related or completely unrelated, do not start it
* Decide whether or not it's helping you achieve your immediate goal
* If it isn't, then make note of whatever it was somewhere. If it's that interesting or important, then you can come back to it later. If it isn't, then it isn't even worth doing now. (ie. related videos that pique your interest)
* Only come back to it when you have leisure time.
* Decide on a limit of your consumption before you engage in leisurely activities on your device. *Do not let yourself find reasons to justify more usage than your predetermined limit*

You have to be strict af about this, otherwise you'll just fall back into old habits. ADHD minds are not built for moderation. You have to strictly impose moderation.

Every time you do this successfully, count it as a success and let yourself feel proud about it. If your goal is to implement this kind of strategy, then it will be rewarding, and it will likely even be far more fulfilling than watching an endless stream of related videos on YouTube.

When you can't think of a valid reason to be using your phone or computer, then don't use it. Tell yourself that the boredom and anxiety you feel when you're not using it is a *good* thing. It means that your brain is adjusting to the new behaviour. Boredom is an incredible source of inspiration if it's not spent on useless shit like YouTube videos. Practice mindfulness during these periods

Think of most of the information as useless, because it is. Be cognizant of what types of information you're letting into your head Take a class in something that interests you. 
If it's something physical you'll get a bonus boost of dopamine. ðŸ˜‰

Even if you get bored and switch to something else frequently, it's still better than only being on your phone or computer. 

Example of classes I have taken over the years: swing dance, salsa, hip hop, middle eastern dance, conga dumming, zills (aka finger cymbals), yoga, pilates, kick boxing, rock climbing, sewing, cooking, painting, ceremics and pottery, and basics of singing. 

Other non class activities I do include swimming, hiking, baking, coloring, and making crafts. 

I am currently taking guitar lessons, and I practice 2-4 hrs a day right now... I really love learning new things, and being a sort of Jack of all Trades. ðŸ˜Š Go on walks, do chores/groceries/shopping, go to work without your phone if you can. There are apps to use which seem to benefit some people. A generic search where you get apps should find them. Arrange your apps and phone in a way that only what you need is on it, and only things that require an action send you a notification. Get rid of entertainment apps (Facebook, Spotify, whatever), get rid of games, get rid of your web browser. Have one home screen which has everything you need to get things done quickly. I think this feeling of anxiety when we aren't constantly "connected" is pretty common these days. A difficulty for me is that almost every aspect of my life is tied to my computer or my phone. I work from home ... on my computer. I like to write for fun ... on my computer. I chat with my friends on twitter/discord/etc. ... on my phone and computer. I have seen people propose like a complete technology "purge" where you don't use your computer/phone at all for a period of time. But I absolutely can't do that. Even just not checking my email could have serious professional consequences. And then if I'm already on there doing stuff I have to do, it's way too easy to get sucked into everything else too. 

I did have one success, which was getting my phone out of my bed. I used to stay up too late on my phone and then take forever to get up because my phone was right there to entertain me. So I bought an actual alarm clock to use instead of my phone alarm. I put it across the room where I have to get up to turn it off, and I put my phone on charge right next to it. I have to be really strict with myself to keep this going. It was tough at first, but I really love the freedom of not being connected and available for a few hours. I like to read in bed, and it's really nice to get lost in the story without keeping on my on my phone all the time.  I do stuff, work (I love working), the gym, hanging out with people, but I swear itâ€™s a straight up addiction.  Thank you! Iâ€™m a college student now and have tried to find clubs I like within my school, maybe I need to look elsewhere. Or go to the gym more.
