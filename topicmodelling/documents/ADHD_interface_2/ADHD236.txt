Any books about dealing with constantly changing passions? You know when you get excited, passionate about something new, but when the exciting part is over, you lose interest quickly. Is something written about dealing with that? Or any methods that helped you stick to it? I can think of a bunch of strategies from a bunch of different books that might help, but I'm guessing you don't want a never-ending reading list. And the methods for dealing with it depend on how long your "passion cycle" lasts and why you lose interest. And, the great capstone to this, most of the answers are going to be things you've heard beforeâ€”planning, prioritization, environmental design, and lifestyle design. There are also likely to be a number of negative thought patterns you've developed around the repeated failures and losses of enthusiasm.

So, uh, yeah... lots possible issues to deal with, and not necessarily a good place to find a comprehensive answer. I totally understand your dilemma though, because I pick up ideas and drop them once the novelty wears off a lot, too.  In fact, this post gave me the idea I should write a book about the topic, and I already have a page of notes on it. In lieu of my unwritten book, I'm going to give you the overlong reading list anyway. This isn't comprehensive, and some of it might not be relevant to what you're struggling with, but the topics they deal with are all interrelated.

* ***Refuse to Choose*** **by Barbara Sher** may help. It's specifically for people who struggle to stick with their passions, and the author has ADD.
* ***Willpower Doesn't Work*** **by Benjamin Hardy** is an excellent resource on goal setting, prioritization, planning, and environmental design. One of the best books I've read this year.
* ***The Dip*** **by Seth Godin** is a tiny little book about when to stick and when to quit. The 'dip' he talks about is basically that loss of enthusiasm when the fun wears off and the work kicks in.
* ***So Good They Can't Ignore You*** and ***Deep Work*** **by Cal Newport** are about developing skills in a single, specific area, so this might not be what you're looking for. But in terms of thoughts on choosing a career, they're worth reading.
* ***The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck*** **by Mark Manson** is rather enlightening. The book really needs to be considered as a whole, but the chapter on rejection and commitment is particularly relevant.
* ***The Happiness of Pursuit*** **by Chris Guillebeau** is about following a passion as a long-term quest with a definitive endpoint. For example, the author's quest was to visit every country in the world, which he did. He also has ADD, and the rest of his books on lifestyle design and entrepreneurship might also help if you're looking for a career or a side income. If you search "chris guillebeau annual review", you'll find a blog post he wrote that's the basis for the system I've been using to plan my goals for the last few years.
* ***Level Up Your Life*** **by Steve Kamb** is pretty good for prioritizing and goal-setting, especially if you're into nerdy stuff like Legos, Lord of the Rings, and video games. There's a lot in here about diet an fitness, too, and it's enough to get started improving your health if your ADHD has let you slip on self-care.
* ***How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big*** **by Scott Adams** should be higher up on this list, but I just thought of it now. Just read it. It's fantastic. The title is descriptive enough to stand on its own.
* ***Understand Your Brain, Get More Done*** **by Ari Tuckman** is an adult ADHD workbook that will give you a how bunch of ADHD-friendly strategies for all areas of your life. In case you might benefit from dealing with ADHD issues in all areas of your life.
* ***The ONE Thing*** **by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan** is another good book for prioritizing and determining the next bite-size step you should take towards your goals. I have no suggestions on books but i have a suggestion in general. You cannot change changing passions in my opinion because wanting to do same thing for 40 years is frankly boring. I was as worried as you (still am but not as much as before) because I have no expertise in any field but constantly find myself jumping and taking big risks (masters student changing majors) . As people with ADHD we are very good at connecting dots so believe in yourself cause this is what you have to do and this is what I'm doing right now and seems to be working

To be more specific , I have changed my masters major because I was quickly bored with what i originally came for. My second major , seemed exciting in the start but soon the enthusiasm started fading and i went into depression, had anxiety , got panic attacks .. yadayadayada . Then i started mixing these two , connecting the dots. I feel excited again to study both of my majors because i am dealing with intersection of my previous interests . This one might have been easy as both relate to my career . But I have confidence that I will in future keeping adding my interests directly or indirectly like beads on a string. And I think in 10 years I would want to start fresh

Good luck , hope you find this helpful Wow. More then I could wish for! Thank you so much
