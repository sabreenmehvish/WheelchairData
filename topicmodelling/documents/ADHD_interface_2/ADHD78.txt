Failing college I'll keep this short. I'm a college freshman. My classes have been harder than I anticipated. The first two weeks went relatively smoothly. Then I started missing assignments and now at the end of semester I am drowning in missed work. Every day is hell. The stress is absolutely paralyzing. the further behind I fall the more difficult it is to get work done. I tried getting homework done over thanksgiving. Nothing. I've sat here for five hours trying to work tonight. Nothing. I'm fucked. I have nowhere to turn. Nothing I've tried has helped at all. Adderall only made me twice as stressed. I took it for two months and am off it now. I feel somewhat better. This will sound pretentious but all I think about all day is philosophy or a novel I read. My dream is to be a writer. That's all I want to do and I feel at odds with my passion for reading and the crippling stress of school. I don't know. Sorry if this didn't read well i'm in a very low place right now. I struggled with my 1st year as well....up until my junior year which took me....7 years. I kno, too long of a story, but you might be able to learn from it. I was on academic probation twice, verge of getting kicked out for a semester, lost/wasted most of my financial aid and Grants....and I graduated with honors in high school and pretty much my entire high school years I was just quiet, shy, and kept to myself most of the time. When I went to college, everything threw me off. First was financial aid and grant. I never really had a lot of money....but college gave me a lot of money.....(1st problem). The structure of college is accountability in which was never taught in grade school for example, homework was enforced throughout high school but college, not neccessary so I didn't do my homework (2nd problem). 3rd problem that I encounter in college is the freedom to skip class....overall, I didn't even party or do crazy things. It's just that college was a whole new world. Like in high school, teachers would always be on your ass, but in college, they only talk to u when u talk to them. You really are treated like an adult...and clearly I wasn't an adult yet... First of all, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Been there - cycled in and out of depression for 5.5 years and even failed out of college - twice! - because at that time I was undiagnosed and didn't even know I had ADHD. Now I've switched programs, gotten diagnosed, and just got on the Dean's list, so there's hope.

ancolie's advice for catching up is pretty spot on. Some other stuff I would add - when I am super behind, I make a huge master list of all the shit I'm behind on. This is gonna seem super overwhelming, I know. But then I take a good look at that list - not everything I've missed is essential to do right here right now! There may be some readings that I should have done in Week 2 on the master list, but maybe there's no test in that class on Week 2 materials. Or maybe I kind of understand the Week 2 lecture that covered that reading and so it's not worth it to waste time trying to do the textbook readings. Either way, I go through and strike out some tasks that aren't worth it to complete anymore. Whatever's left, I rank - things that are *SUPER essential must get done ASAP =* 5 points, *sort of important/not as time sensitive* = 3 points, *would have been nice to have done but not a priority =* 1 point. And then it becomes a game. I set rewards for myself worth 10, 15, 20 points etc - rewards I can actually do and just gamify getting shit done. Maybe at 10 points I let myself read a novel for an hour, or watch a movie, or buy a caramel macchiato. Idk. Whatever floats your boat.  The point is to make it a game, and to also realize you're not gonna magically do every single thing perfectly at this point. That's not even the objective anymore - you're going to have to let go of doing all the things and start picking just some stuff to get done.

The broader life thing. I would suggest getting through this first semester or full academic year and then exploring a couple options. If your interests lie in philosophy and literature, are those your majors? If you're committed to exploring them and they're not your focus areas of study, is it feasible for you to switch? I switched from engineering to social sciences after a bunch of hemming and hawing and just being more interested in my classes has helped me care more about the work itself (not always - and this is important!! Even though it's my dream field, a bunch of the work is still boring drudgery that sucks. That's life. The idea that following your passion = never working a day in your life is garbage. Dream careers often require a bunch of boring difficult tasks in between the exciting bits. See more below).

Alternately, maybe try to take a semester off after this semester or school year, if your school allows. Even if your school doesn't allow that, you can at least do the following over the summer holidays: get a part-time job for bills and commit to writing **daily**. Even if you've worked an eight hour shift at a coffeeshop, commit to writing something every day the way people like Murakami did (he writes about how he ran a bar fulltime and wrote his first novel late at night after closing, or after waking up early in the morning in his memoir *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*)*.* Like *really* commit to daily writing - find an accountability partner to whom you can show what you've written at the end of every single day if you're worried about not being disciplined enough to do that. Daily writing is the first step to being a writer and pursuing your dream.

A thing to consider with regards to writing. Every single writer in world says that the key to writing is writing *even when you don't feel like it*. You cannot just wait for inspiration to strike. Whether you're blocked or stuck or tired, you need to try to write *something* and just chip away at it whether the muse is there or not. Why? Because it's this chipping away slowly that builds the muscle of writing and often, surprisingly, gets the writer on a roll and inspired even if they weren't at the start. Also every writer says the actual process of writing (putting words to paper or screen) sucks ass and is super difficult. You will feel just as uninterested in it at times as you do in your schoolwork right now. It will seem like drudgery. It will seem boring. So. You can take the fact that your current schoolwork sucks ass and that you don't wanna do it and reframe doing it as practice for being the novelist you want to be. You're gonna chip away at this slowly even though you don't feel like it, because this is going to build the muscle for doing that with your writing in the future. 

Sorry for the novel I wrote, and I wish you the absolute best. I'm also Going Through It with exams and essays right now, but the chat is always open if you have more questions or need some support. Best of luck and I believe in you! Had the same issue in my first year of college (before I was diagnosed with adhd, although my school psychiatrist suggested it; he wasnt allowed to treat it though).

Totally fucked up my first semester, and my regular depression turned into a major depressive episode by second semester. I'd absolutely hate to see anyone else end up as low as I did (not leaving the bed unless I needed to pee, extremely suicidal; lasted over 6 months). I was always a pretty self-driven student before, too. Ended up taking a last-minute medical withdrawal to avoid flunking out of uni. It was incredibly hard to decide this and tell my parents, but at that point it was either use ALL of my allowed late-class drops or withdraw entirely.

I dont know what your situation is, but withdrawing was seriously the best decision I could have made. I withdrew mid-May this year and found a job that I love working at about a month later. Got a psychiatrist in my hometown, got my diagnoses sorted out, and am now trialing different meds. I am by no means "cured", but I'm a hell of a lot better than I was one year ago. Planning on starting up one or two community college classes soon and slowly build back up to a full schedule, then transferring the credits to uni (my school has no limit on time off from withdrawal, but most schools usually have a specific semester/quarter limit they allow off before you're not considered a student anymore).

Taking time off can be a huge relief, but if you are worried that you wont find the motivation to go back once you leave, consider taking a lighter course load if possible. Dont compare yourself to other people/being "on time", this is another thing that added unnecessary stress for me.

Unfortunately, this situation seems to be common across us ADHD-ers and it can feel like the world is ending, but I've seen lots of success stories, so I think we can make it through too! Feel free to PM if you are feeling stressed and need to vent. Hey friend! I more or less bombed my first semester of college, then stopped going to class at all in my second... so I've been there, and I get it.

If you're interested I do have some things that work for me in terms of catching up with missing work (which is a constant battle, even now that I'm on reasonably better footing academically) - mostly, it boils down to doing whatever I have to in order to shake my brain out of its usual weird fog. It's helpful for me to study in a totally new place (quiet cafes, libraries that aren't used as often, empty classrooms) that I don't associate strongly with either relaxing (like my room) or procrastinating and getting nothing done (like the library I'd usually study in). I also listen to a lot of music while I study, generally without lyrics, and use the length it takes a song to play as a good gauge of getting stuff done. I.e., finish a sentence by the time it's finished, then move on. Or a paragraph, if what I'm writing is flowing well. 

And sometimes none of that works, and I still end up cramming full assignments into the past-midnight hours of the last week of the semester. Stress can reach a breaking point and turn into a powerful motivation, even if it temporarily drives you nuts in the process.

But in general, all these are personal coping strategies meant to trick my particular brain into doing shit, not one-size-fits-all solutions. The more general things to focus on are to _not stop_ no matter how far down the hole of missed work you get, to keep communication with your professors open (and beg for extensions and mercy if necessary), and to realize that one semester, however horrible, doesn't have to define the rest of your college experience. 

Long term, you might want to explore what options your school has for accommodations for learning differences and disabilities, as well as consider whether something like cognitive behavioral therapy or a different medication might help. But again - there's no one-size-fits-all solution there. Best of luck. <3 All to say, this is the transitional phase you are experiencing from high school bullshit stuff to adulthood and work life. Yeah, its tough, yeah it's a struggle, but you're not alone. I'm sure I can't speak for all that u are going through but I can say that this transitional phase thingy is a part of it. Is ok to fail,  as long as you learn from it and keep going,  that's how the real world works unfortunately. Life and time doesn't wait for no one. You can sit around,  but Don't sit around too long. By the time you kno it,  7 years will pass and you will be like me.  Oh my god I feel like I’m reading my own words. I’m in the exact same boat as you, that’s exactly how my semester has been. I feel like every waking second is a nightmare of pileups and deadlines. It’s 4:30 am almost and I was supposed to get soo much more done today than I did. I have to wake up at 6 to finish some homework before class then finish something else I’ve barely started before midnight tomorrow. My mental health has steadily declined over the last few months. Anyway you’re definitely not alone, I really really feel you and it sucks so much. At least it’s almost over for a month or so, that’s how I’m going to get through this week lol.  Hi, 

first off: I live in Germany, many things are diffrent here.

After what should relate to high school in the states we either go to university or we make an apprenticeship.

I cant imgagine doing anything academic because the dry frontal schooling just kills my brain. And the self organization and motivation is a big problem for me as well.

Currently I am doing a apprenticeship in a IT firm and even though I dont want to do that forever (another aspiring writer/storyteller here) I actually learn to organize myself in a forgiving un-soul-crushing envoirenment. 

So If you can find something simmilar. Non academic, more practical. That still gives you a bread job / fallback career you can live with. I highly recommend it!

(I got to say I have no Idea what college is for ^^' I could be missing some Important insight)

I FEEL YA! I'm in my first year of college like you and I had the same issue. I had my diagnosis at the beginning of the semester but went most of the semester untreated and tried to just work hard, which didn't turn out to good for me. I had the work ethic but not the focus to actually be successful in my assignments and in studying leading to my grades being less than ideal. Then I decided to try going on medication and with some trial and error I've found what works for me and my grades are starting to reflect that. If adderall wasn't good for you then don't be afraid to talk to your psychiatrist and try something else, because odds are there's something out there that will be a much better fit for you, sometimes it just takes some trial and error. But if you're adamant about going without medication, then there's plenty of things you can do to reduce your symptoms such as exercising, eating healthy, meditation, and DEFINITELY sleep. It won't fix your symptoms but reducing your stress the best you can and keeping yourself healthy will have a BIG impact :) I'll also add that I've heavily considered attempting to forge my own way as a writer independently, but I feel that my poor work ethic would quickly bring the downfall of that dream.

also if anyone has tips on combating sleep deprivation I would love to hear that as well Thanks to both who replied so quickly. I appreciate it a lot. Hearing you stories is comforting and I will do my best to use the tips you gave me. I cannot give nearly enough thanks I was reading your post I n a bookstore and turned to my left to see Murakami’s biography so that was weird. 

Thank you and everyone so much, I’ve used some of these tips today and they have been helpful. For those who said they were aspiring writers what book are you currently reading? I’m reading 𝘎𝘳𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘵𝘺’𝘴 𝘙𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘣𝘰𝘸 which has been super difficult but rewarding, I just wish I could devote more time to it. > Dont compare yourself to other people/being "on time", this is another thing that added unnecessary stress for me.

This, exactly. Recently now I'm starting to feel like I should take 4 courses a semester instead of 5, as one always falls by the wayside. As evidenced by the only two 50s in my transcript... Honestly, I've started coming to terms with it because university is not a race at all. Speaking with others about it has helped solidify it. Even speaking about this to my counsellor, she's said she completed her undergrad in 5 years vs 4.
