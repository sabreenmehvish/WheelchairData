I'm reading "Delivered From Distraction". Author says he hates quiet. Is this normal? He says he finds quiet reading rooms hell. He concentrated better in loud environments.

I'm the opposite. I have SO much trouble concentrating with ANY noises around me, unless it's birds chirping, or crickets, or a train far away.

Are there others who are easily distracted by noise, or are most ADHD people like the author?

Thanks for any feedback. [deleted] Iâ€™m kind of a mixture. If Iâ€™m at school and reading I will get distracted by any kind of noise, I need it to be completely silent. However when Iâ€™m at home, I hate just reading, itâ€™s so boring, I usually put some music on. Doesnâ€™t help me read better, I just hate the silence and only doing one thing bores me. I know it doesnâ€™t make sense but thatâ€™s just me ðŸ˜‚ I am completely the opposite of this author, for real omg That interesting. Thanks so much!

Also, when it IS quiet I totally go into my inner world. The problem with noise is I canâ€™t control whether that gets my full attention or the book Iâ€™m reading, project Iâ€™m doing, etc...

Same with talking. Itâ€™s hard for me  converse with someone if any other conversations are going on. It takes a Herculean effort for me to keep listening. I think itâ€™s why I hate noise so much. It gets in my way.

Iâ€™ve thought Iâ€™ve had misophonia all this time. Or maybe I have both. No that makes sense.

I know white noise and music without lyrics doesnâ€™t distract me. I put that on with headphones to drown out talking, plastic bottles crinkling, typing, or other specific stuff that makes me feel furious.
