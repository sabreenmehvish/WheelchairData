I feel stupid and brain damaged I was an intelligent child, and I excelled at school without ever having to try. In high school I grew extremely depressed and anxious, and this coincided with me feeling like my brain was broken. I couldn't remember a damn thing.

About a 18 months ago I was at the end of my rope, so I finally swallowed my pride and went to a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADD (inattentive type). I'm now on effexor and adderall.

And I feel even dumber than before. I'm in my last year of college, and I feel like I haven't learned a thing. I read and re-read, yet I can't seem to retain information. I used to be in the top of my class throughout my adolescence, but now I'm average at best. My education over the last 7-8 years has seemed to have gone in one ear and out the other.

My quick wit and my intelligence was my identity growing up. I was the smart, charismatic kid who excelled with ease. Now I'm emotionless, stupid, and dysfunctional. It's really demoralizing to look backyard and realize that I've absorbed and retained so little information and memories.

I'm sorry for the sob story, but I have no one to share this with. Has anyone else experienced this sort of mental decline, and did you find a way to get your brain back? Sometimes I feel like I'm past the point of no return... Brain fog. You're experiencing brain fog which is a symptom of anxiety, depression, AND ADHD. Meds help some ppl with this, other times it doesn't help. CBT can help, a healthy diet and exercise can help, a good support system can help. Vitamin deficiencies play a roll in making brain fog worse, so make sure you're getting ALL your essential nutrients. (Remember the 100% rda amount is the bare minimum for optimum human functioning-- as in you need AT lEAST 100% of of the rda for each nutrient each day. Magnesium is a big one people don't get enough of, you're supposed to get at least 400mg but I think the average Western adult gets like 100mg a day.)

I hope this helps but in any case remember YOU ARE NOT "stupid" or "brain damaged", it's just a symptom of multiple disorders that you have that makes you feel that way.  Oh yeah, don't feel alone. I had insanely high potential, I've put in tons of work to get to a better future, but I have nothing to show for it. I have very valuable skills but no ability to sit down and use them. I've only started getting help in the last few months, but the rate of improvement is painstakingly slow. It doesn't help that I forget about appointments all the time, even when I set reminders. Try cognitive behavioural therapy with a psychologist or other mental health professional with cbt training. Depression and anxiety take on a life of their own after a while and this therapy method is super useful in learning how to challenge depressed or anxious ways of thinking. There are even therapists that specialize in adhd. 

Medication and therapy together works best for depression, anxiety, and most mental health disorders. This is like reading an autobiography. I have the same three diagnoses and the same major concern-- my memory.

\[tldr; think about Vyvanse, talk to someone specifically about memory\]

My mom died when I was in seventh grade, and after months of really struggling the adults in my life finally brought me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with GAD, major depression, and inattentive ADD. It made a lot of sense. Early in high school, I was prescribed Vyvanse and it really helped me, not only with my ADD but also with my depression, except that it at one point gave me a panic attack.

For that reason (panic attacks are terrible), I went off Vyvanse my senior year and suddenly realized that I couldn't remember anything. What I ate the day before, what we did in class, plans that I made, where I put my phone. Any information I want to access is inaccessible and I can only remember things incidentally.

I was so confused, and I was convinced that something had happened. I thought that maybe I somehow had Alzheimer's, I thought that I might have a brain tumor. I thought that something must be going terribly wrong. It was terrifying, and it's still terrifying. Whatever focus I can muster on a daily basis, whatever productivity I can wring from myself, it's like nothing happened because I can't remember any of it.

I know that much might not be helpful. One thing though, something I've been thinking about, is that I never felt more normal than I did on Vyvanse. It made my palms sweat, but I enjoyed life, I was deeply interested in my hobbies, I kept a regular journal, I did well in class and my classwork looked freaking awesome. Not to mention I can remember more about the time period during which I was taking Vyvanse than any other. I think the issue I had with Vyvanse had to do with the dosage. I never got the chance as a kid to talk to the psychiatrist about it because he offended my abusive father and we never went back. I found an effective solution for my panic attacks (Ativan, a life saver) after a particularly bad one brought me to the ER. Now that I'm in college, I'm trying to work up the motivation to see someone so I can talk about my symptoms and possibly try Vyvanse again, in some hope that my mind can return to normal.

Beyond that, I personally want to get a professional's opinion about my poor memory. I'm wondering what a therapist or psychologist might have to say. I want to really emphasize that while I might have a lot they'd like to discuss, my greatest concern is my memory. Someone has to have some idea as to why this happened.

Sorry, that was a lot. Best of luck to you. I'd love to know if you find something that helps. I have heard patients complain about the extreme dullness of their mental sharpness & of their physical body on Effexor. I’ve heard patients say they hardly feel anything from the waist down-as in a female patient said Effexor could be used for bladder spasms because she never felt like she had to urinate while on Effexor, just never felt anything in her bladder or anywhere in that region. All people react differently to all meds. It usually takes a trial of a few meds or different doses to see what works best. 
Good luck. You’re not stupid.  This is literally me. Have chronic depression/ anxiety, been taking SSRIs on/off for half my life, and only just got diagnosed with add. I feel stupider than ever, since I can hardly remember anything over my 4 year college degree. 

Can’t remember anything.  Stupid, no.

Brain damaged, pretty much.  That's why it's a disability and not just a disorder, your brain is literally not functioning the way it's supposed to and areas of it are deformed. It sounds like those meds don't work for you. For some people, it takes a few tries to find the right meds. Everyone's brain chemistry is different and everyone reacts differently to medication. I have an ADHD friend who tried strattera and it didn't do a thing for her, I tried it and it works perfectly for me. Ask your doctor to try something else.  I have ADHD inattentive type as well and antidepressants made me feel dead inside. Stimulant medications actually vastly improved my depression which I had developed partly due to constantly feeling incompetent because of my ADHD. Taking stimulants makes me feel competent and intelligent as long as I take them regularly and I will never take an antidepressant again due to how it made me feel.  But the meds will also never make up for the years I went undiagnosed and unable to hold on to memories. It's very difficult for me to remember things including happy events, childhood experiences, and details about places, people, etc. But I do feel that the meds have significantly improved my ability to store new memories.

Did you start both of your meds at the same time? If so you may not be able to differentiate between the side effects of each one, but I would bet the antidepressants are not helping you based on what I've read abut them being ineffective for ADHD. And it is also likely that the cause of your depression is your ADHD, not the other way around. So it makes sense to treat the ADHD first. Check dosage on your stimulant meds. If they're working you will feel more effective, alert, and happy. If you're taking too low of a dose or if you're taking the wrong stimulant for you you may get side effects such as trouble sleeping, excessive irritability, loss of appetite, constipation, etc. Or your symptoms may not improve.

Medications are amazing, but it sucks that sometimes we have to experiment for so long to find what works. A month on a particular medication and dosage usually gives you a good baseline to know if it's working or not. And your dosage may need to be increased over time or you may need to switch meds eventually.

I wish you the best in figuring out the best meds for you as fast as possible. I feel like that now; I think part of it is you get to a point in school or work where all your previous compensation methods are insufficient. Lots of people have great responses, so I’m just going to narrow in on one detail you said. 

Feeling like you can’t learn or remember- I can empathize. I *just* realized that since I’m on medication for the first time at school, I need to learn new ways to learn. Before, I had to write notes constantly so I didn’t get distracted. Now (w medicine,) every time I write something, I am no longer attending to the teacher talking. I have been adjusting my note-taking ratio and it is helping how much I understand during class and remember after. B/c now I actually *can* remember things w/o writing it all down, and *can’t* remember things if I was writing instead of listening, where before, I could write AND listen. 

Recording lectures is an easy accommodation that can help more immediately than examining and possibly adjusting your student habits, such as note taking. 

Sorry you feel badly. “Smart” is the work you put in to get you toward your goal, not where you started :-). You are amazing! You’ll get through this!! I feel like I'm reading my own biography. I used to pride myself in my memories and my quick wit. Now I'm just a broken man. im so sorry that you are going through this :,(.. have you tried antidepressants ? Have you try a different combination of meds? I totally feel your pain. Depression has been a big struggle for me for decades along with ADHD.

But you're definitely not past the point of no return! Maybe it seems that way but it will get better if you keep fighting.

Being severely depressed makes it impossible to retain information or to be charismatic or any of that. And being depressed also makes everything seem hopeless and impossible and way worse than it really is.

It takes a long long time (weeks for me) for Effexor to start to take effect. Not sure when you started.  And maybe it just isn't right for you anyway. There are several other options available, thankfully.

I think advice on here for therapy is spot on. And work with your doc and therapist on the right med combo. Hang in there. I'm really sorry the struggle is so tough.

 I relate a ton to your experience of being smart and high functioning as a child but performing less and less as time goes on.  and yet explaining your adhd symptoms as ‘well I guess I must just be a moron - that sucks.”

The turning point was literally realizing how smart I still am. To work on my feelings of i herrent incompetence my therapist had me keep a list of the character judgements people have vocalized to me - like you’re so resourceful/creative/good with words etc. Then one day I was Skyping with an old friend - things got deep and I explained the experience of discovering my adhd and that I literally thought I was just stupid my whole life and now I understand why. And my friend retorted with a clearly genuine, somewhat indignant “you know you’re very intelligent, right?”. Because I know her so well, I knew she wouldnt say that if she didn’t mean it. That’s just how she is - she’s a radically honest person. I trust that completely. So when she went “you’re a Smart Person, actually, my brain went “omg you’re right”. It was that simple. Some switch was flipped.

My memory may be terrible, and I may often struggle with follow through without artificial EF coping mechanisms, but I have so many strengths I now have a better shot at accessing now that I know what the problem was and that I can make the struggles easier to accept and deal with by rearranging my environment (with star charts, stickies, planners, other tools small children use, I don’t give a f 😂) and yes things still really suck sometimes but learning to give yourself kindness in the face of suffering helps it suck a liiittle bit less and it will help get you through, trust me.

If you haven’t watched the lecture in the faq section of this subreddit (or the “start here” section or whatever it’s called) I’d recommend watching it. It will help you understand the disorder. And For me, understanding the disorder with sufficient  nuance was the key to accepting that it’s NOT MY FAULT and I might as well cut myself some slack when my lack of EF wreaks havoc on my life. Shits pretty damn hard to go through, and whipping the horse to death sure isn’t going to help anything anyway, so maybe I’ll give it a break and say some soothing words instead.

One more thing! Have you heard of the idea of being “twice exceptional?” It means you’re both intellectually  gifted “ (prob had very bright future as a youngster/were or in gifted classes or were a high performer) AND disabled/have a neuro dev disorder like autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, or ADHD etc. So you kindof just turn out looking average but living with these very specific struggles. Like this nagging sense of underachievement that follows you your entire life. Frustration that you’re clearly smart in some ways so why can’t you finish LITERALLY ANYTHING before the ninth hour? So you begin to incorporate being an Incompetent Person into your identity. And you have to surgically remove that thinking to free yourself.

Anyway it was very helpful for me to read about so maybe it could help you too. I’m sure you’re smarter than you’re giving yourself credit for, and it’s not your fault! But you do have the power to change your situation so keep trying different coping tools and try try try to cut yourself some slack. Be a friend to yourself <3 good luck hope things get better soon :)
 How long have you been on the antidepressant? sameeeeee I study methylation and take a shit ton of vitamins. Really was life changing for me.  Do you take your effexor properly everyday? I'm on it and it's an absolute bitch if you mismanage it. Maybe your meds? Hey, I’m the same way! Speaking from experience, don’t abuse ambien or benzos because it will definitely make shit worse and you will contemplate suicide constantly as a result 👍🏻 One thing to add to what others have said, I had these exact problems while I was in school for years. Once I had finally graduated (at 32) and started in the field I loved, it was a different ball game. Something about actually getting to do what I enjoyed rather than learning the abstracts behind it in a school environment really woke me up. Medication has obviously been key, and I would keep searching for the right one, but don’t forget about how taxing the education environment can be for some people. I can’t really explain it well but maybe others will understand.  Damn sorry to hear man, I share some of the same feelings.

Unless I'm hyperfocused on something that needs alot of focus ain a high pressure situation, I  generally don't have the mental stanima and feel lost. I have two version of me, the ADHD and the one on meds, it's kinda sad but its better this way.

I had to go through drepression and anxiety in my early twenties to form what I guess is a new identity to how I used to percieve myself when I was growing up.

It was much easyier to manage my ADHD, (basically going unnoticed) when I didn't have all the adult responsibilites. **CBT helped me a TON for all three things—MDD, GAD, and ADHD.**

**Talk to your doctor!** Tell them you’re feeling sluggish and stupid! If things have gotten worse then you might need different meds or to change your dosage.

**I know it is really hard and scary right now**. And you’ve had your whole life to practice negative thought loops and beating yourself up. 

But, your symptoms *are* treatable and you *will* get through this stretch of your life.

**Therapy**. If your school’s counseling center can’t help you, see if your school has a clinical psych graduate program—they sometimes offer cheap therapy on a sliding scale where you work with a student therapist-in-training. **The university where I did my graduate degree even had an ADHD support group for undergrads that taught you coping mechanisms and tricks to work with your brain instead of against it.**

I am so sorry it is so difficult and exhausting right now but **you’re not alone in what you’re feeling and experiencing and things can change for the better with treatment. Much love and good luck.** This is a super long story, so sorry, but in the interest of empathizing: I was smart as a teenager but didn't apply myself (not surprising...) and did the bare minimum to still be considered a decent student. (And I, too, felt that my quick wit and intelligence were some of my more present, attractive qualities.) I really amped up my school work ethic in college (after a year off between high school and college) and started making grades a priority (better study skills didn't necessarily come immediately...), so much so that I was panicking over A's that *might* be B's at the end of the semester, even though I was getting pretty consistent high A's. Anyway, I was a double major and had finished my first major (psychology) and was in my 9th semester (fall) to finish my second major, math. I was in my 4 hardest/final classes at the same time (Discrete Dynamical Systems, Numerical Methods, Ordinary Differential Equations, and my senior seminar course--I could barely remember the names of the courses when writing this, if that tells you anything...), while working 2 jobs. I have never been *the* brightest kid in the room, but maybe in the top 35% brightest kids in the room? 

ANYWAY, in my senior seminar class (which is where you sort of outline and wrap up with a nice academic bow the shit you've learned in your major) we had to do a presentation in the beginning of the semester on a mathematical concept as if we were "explaining it to a sophomore math major." My teacher posted this assignment in the middle of the summer before the fall semester started, so when I looked at the assignment in summer and checked the list of mathematical concepts that we could choose from to dilute down to a sophomore's understanding, I was like, "I don't know what half of this shit is, and another quarter of it I know what it is but I don't think I could explain it." Then came the actual presentations...for more than a few reasons, my classmates' presentations were not all satisfactory in my mind. Poor presenting skills didn't help, but most of them talked about a concept that was actually new to me, and I left the presentations feeling like I didn't know fucking anything at all...as a senior! I just felt like the smartasses in the math department (there certainly were a few) had just stood in front of me and spoken Ancient Greek and left feeling proud of themselves that *they* understood what they said. That feeling just snowballed for the rest of the semester. 

Instead of exiting my last college semester with a great GPA, two bachelor's, and a smile because I was done, I left with a great GPA (\~3.65), two bachelor's, and rock-bottom self-esteem, feeling hopeless, waking up in the middle of the night to continue panicking and crying. Most of the semester I found myself saying, "I'm the dumbest person in the math department," over and over again because I felt this profound feeling that *everyone was understanding this complex, degree-polishing material, and it had gone in one of my ears and swiftly exited the other ear.* It was a crippling feeling. I pushed through it and asked as many questions as I wanted, regardless of how much it slowed any of my classes. (Sorry to be that person, but if you can afford to not pay attention in class, then you can afford for me to spend that time going over problem 1 fourteen times.) Eventually one or two people in my classes said to me that they admired my relentless question-asking because they also didn't understand and were too afraid to speak up about it. It also didn't help that some of my teachers' teaching methods were not so much of teaching and more of reciting from a textbook and offering no further explanation. That compounded the issues I was already having. It really just felt like everyone knew what was going on as soon as it was presented to them while I was over here with my finger in my nose going, "huh?" I felt like my mental acuity had been robbed from me overnight before the semester started.

&#x200B;

So when you say your brain is broken, I feel that every day. I'm 2 years removed from graduating college and, unfortunately, the broken brain feeling hasn't gotten better...it just presents itself in new situations (I've also gone through different medications between high school, college, and now, and also stopped exercising and stopped really making friends in the last 2 years, which has not helped me feel like I'm reaching a good place with my ADHD/depression/anxiety). When I got an accounting job after college (after the anxiety saga about finding a job, of course), I came home hating myself every day for the first two months because I felt like an idiot (because I was learning so much new stuff and couldn't make sense of it immediately). Meanwhile, my boss was singing my praises to his boss because he was so impressed with me. It was a very strange dynamic for someone to see me as excelling, while at the very same time I felt like my mental abilities were deteriorating in real time and I was forced to live through the breakdown process inside and save face on the outside. Unfortunately, when I feel like all I can say is, "my brain is broken?!" the only thing I can do is remind myself that I have felt this before and that I have to carve out my own path of appreciation and success within it. What does it take for me to feel confident in what I've learned (been told)? Or remember any of it? Do I need to spend 8 hours with the textbook? Then fine, that's what I'll do. Do I need to make a binder of repetitive notes? Then fine, that's what I'll do. I have a horrible memory and can barely remember what I ate for breakfast, but if writing everything down is what it takes to not feel like shit all the time, then I guess that's what I have to do. (easier said than done)

&#x200B;

When I feel the things you've described, I feel like I'm a lukewarm potato in a world of super robots. It's most days. It can get better, though. Know that you are worth more than you feel, and that others probably see more in you than you do in yourself, *especially* when you feel emotionless, stupid, and dysfunctional. Hang in there, and don't hate yourself for what you have to deal with because of your ADHD. On this note, electrolytes are super important for brain function as well! Great, now I'm thinking about Joe and the Volcano.  PSA: if you supplement magnesium (firstly: avoid oxide, shoot for glycinate) also supplement calcium, because your body may confuse excess magnesium for calcium. I just wanted to say that I’m glad you found Ativan to help for your attacks. I’ve been to the ER four times now for severe attacks and Ativan has been the one thing that keeps them at bay (as needed - not a regular dose). I keep some at home, in my car and at my office at work. I recently decided to try a new antidepressant in the form of Prozac as an every day prevention for the attacks, and I have been amazed over the last several months at the changes from it. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve had to take my Ativan since the Prozac started working - and those were just preventative doses that I took because I knew something particularly anxiety-provoking was coming up. I hope you are able to get back to a psychiatrist and ask about further meds. I finally decided after years that I needed to not give up on them, and I’m so glad I did. Good luck.  I completely relate with this, wasn’t diagnosed until last year (at 20y.o.) and while I know I had a good childhood full of fun, most of what I “remember” is foggy and intangible, often I realize I’m just remembering a family photo and sometimes reliving a memory only makes me notice how many details I’m missing and it drives me crazy. 

There’s something I’ve done forever though that started helping after I got adderall to help lock in anything new coming into my mind - anytime I’m on my own somewhere I act completely insane and imagine random fake scenarios to distract myself from real life. But, if any imaginary conversation triggers any sort of memory then I tell it to myself, acting like I’m telling the story to someone with infinite patience and interest in me. 

Because I obsessively stress about wording, I’ll rephrase bits of it over and over again until it feels right. Not only does it lock the memory better, but if that story does ever happen to come up naturally in conversation, I’ve already practiced telling it and won’t get stressed about the right word for something weirdly specific because I already spent 30 minutes in the car thinking of that word. Overall I tend to over share because I’m too excited just to _have_ a story from my past, forgetting to determine if it’s interesting or not, but I’ll take what I can get.  Wow, I had problems with exactly this and just felt so lost and regretful after graduating. I literally feel like I have to start everything all over because I didn't really "learn"/retain everything in the 4 yrs I did. How did you figure out what worked for you? I didn't get medicated til after I finished school, but I want to go and do everything well. What about with studying and reading textbooks in a given amount of time? It is what it is...I suppose it's my cross to bear. I'm currently on effexor (an SNRI), so yeah.  I haven’t figured it out yet; it’s definitely a work in progress. I got diagnosed after undergrad, and now I’m back in graduate school. For the whole first year I was convinced I had hit my ceiling and wasn’t smart enough to get a PhD.

I’m a little different than you b/c I remember lots from college classes when I was unmedicated, but was having trouble learning new things in now, with the medicine. One of my theories is that my ADHD brain doesn’t memorize, but it learns things by connecting them to other things I know. Once I have those connections, I remember big ideas well (though not details, lol.) However, I might miss the last 3/5 things the prof was teaching, b/c I was busy mentally making connections w the first 2.

Now that I have medicine, I am hearing 5/5 things, perhaps storing them in short term memory, but not making connections- therefore, limited deep learning or long term memory. I felt myself forgetting, so I’d write notes frantically, a habit that previously helped in school, but (I gradually realized) was now hindering me. 

In terms of studying and reading textbooks, do you mean pre diagnosis in college or now? B/c pre diagnosis, I just didn’t do much of what I saw as “extra” work, anything that didn’t have to be handed in, like reading and studying. My major luckily emphasized projects over tests, and conceptual tests over fact retrieval tests, so I did okay. Now I can actually read and study, which is awesome.

My reading speed has decreased, but I didn’t read the words carefully (wouldn’t know the main character’s name by the end of the book; didn’t pay attention to unknown words, neither for pronunciation or meaning; wouldn’t stop myself if I didn’t understand something.) Now it takes me longer to finish non-fiction text, but I get more out of it, so it’s a tradeoff I’ll take. 

I’m a little confused about your tenses. Are you going back to school and want to improve your learning habits? Or do you want to refresh things you learned in college? Or both, I suppose. I feel like I might have missed exactly what you were asking in terms of what your goals are, and want to make sure my answer is relevant to your questions :-).  Don’t give up looking for one that works. It takes time to see the full effects, but once that time has passed and you’re not seeing the results you need, talk to your psychiatrist about possibly trying a different one. I made the mistake before about this and it kept me from finding a life changing med until years later.  Sorry about that, I finished my degree last yr, but I want to return to grad school. Thank you for your well thought out post! I didn't have the best undergrad experience(When I took summer classes at other universities, it made me really how much was glossed over at my school...), it also didn't help that had bad habits and once the work got harder 2 yrs in when I needed to do the invisible work(Reading my textbooks and practicing problems, it became a problem...) I didn't get medicated until after I graduated and have yet to try school with the medication. I guess wanted to know how improve my learning habits? 
When I was in college I'd remember the information for the time I needed it, but what I really needed to do was make the connections in my learning to retain it. So having that "long term" and "deeper" learning  is what I wanted to have in order to do graduate school differently... No problem! That’s what I first assumed, but then I was second-guessing.

I think the best way I found to improve the depth and length of my learning was to make studying as active as I could. I had a leg up b/c I taught special education between finishing my last degree and this program. I don’t know if I would have made it through w/o knowing so much about improving learning for people w various challenges.

I’ll jot down a few ways I kept invisible work active and maybe some will help you!

Basic examples: writing flash cards, highlighting/annotating texts, making and reorganizing outlines, returning to notes and putting a summary at the end of each day (see Cornell note taking,) going to office hours and study sessions

Literal examples: walk while studying flashcards. Say the answers to the flashcards out loud. Exercise bike while listening or watching a YouTube video on the topic. 

Higher effort & higher payout examples:
1) diagram, draw, or visually represent systems, physical constructs, or anything you can think of. If it’s a system you have to learn, draw it (w labels,) copy it, then cover it and try to draw it again. You won’t be able to, but you’ll get some of it. Cover it again and try to draw as much as you can before you have to look again. When you finish, cover it and repeat. Once you can replicate it two or more times from memory, do something else for 5 minutes, then do it from memory again.  If you can’t, peek and repeat the “learn to draw it from memory steps.” Keep extending the time before recreating it. Do it right before bed and/or once in the morning. 
2) sort as you study flashcards. Ones you know fully, w/o peeking, go face down on the desk (that way, they’ll be the first ones you see when you start and you’ll get a boost from success when you restart studying.) place ones that you sort of knew back at the back of the pile. Tuck one that you didn’t know in the front/middle of the pile. (a) If you have lots of new words, try to learn 3-5, not all at once. Gradually build your pile. (b) be wary of recognition. This is why I say the answers out loud. Sometimes you sort of know the answer, flip to the back and say, “oh yeah, I knew that” and then are lost on the test. 
3) google tests from previous or other classes and take them, don’t just read the Q&As. After you finish, use a different color pen to correct your own answers by finding the correct answers in the book. 
4) try to find a song or mnemonic for any list you have to straight memorize. Practice the song and any motions along with YouTube, even if you feel like a fool. 
5) ask a friend if you can explain a concept to them. You might discover a flaw in your comprehension when you get to a point you can’t explain, or make a connection you hadn’t noticed before. Some online advice says to just “make sure you can explain it,” but if I’m not producing something tangible, written or orally, I don’t actually have a clear grasp on whether I know it well enough to explain. 

These were mostly study oriented, not project planning or critical reading or any of the other skills that are important to learning, but tests are the hardest thing for me. Also, you mentioned being frustrated with memory, and these will help with that, test or not! I hope they’re useful, I still have a long way to go. Good luck!
