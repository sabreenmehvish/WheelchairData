Wanna cry I can’t focus I’m at lunch rn 


Also I’m at school


I take adderall btw 


My meds haven’t been working today :(


My mom said she would run me over another pill but it’s been hours since she said that so I’m not keeping my fingers crossed 


We’re doing a project in history and I can’t concentrate or focus I try and try but it’s not working 


I wanna just go cry in the bathroom 😔 Teachers are very understanding about these things. If it is too scary to tell him/her you can always send them an e-mail. I hope your mood will improve. Best of luck kiddo! Thought I read ‘mum said she’d run me over” at first glance. Glad that wasn’t the case!😂 Sometimes the guilt and insecurities are the biggest distraction of all, so don’t dwell on the fact that it’s a ‘bad’ day. Today is a good day and tomorrow will be better.

Even as a self-employed adult, I notice that my editors are appreciative whenever I communicate my difficulties with them. Teachers are apparently more ‘in the know’ than they were when I was a kid, so don’t be ashamed to say something.  Tell your teacher? Maybe he/she can reschedule the group date. That's what happened when I was at high school and when there was an issue with a group presentation.  I have a crazy suggestion: you did prepare before-hand, right?
If so, this happened to me in high school:
I had an individual presentation about a book in our reading programme (Saramago,blegh) and i was panicking because 1, it's defnitely not my type of literature and 2, the auther, despite the nobel prize, is absolutely awful. So i tried my best to organize all my tasks but eventually forgot. I snapped, I had a panic attack the hour before class because I hadnt started reading the book and my part was at least 4 chapters in. Solution? I took the obvious subjects to approach and created a sort of debate, which got my classmates talking at me as I "presented", and wrapped it up in about 10 minutes. Got an A and they said I should have had taken longer, or so I heard while I ran off to the nearest bathroom How you doing? Vyvanse > adderall
(For me at least) Thanks  Lol  Yeah ok thanks :) It’s a individual project  We were just doing the project in history I wasn’t presenting I’m out of school now and couldn’t get any work done in any of my classes including the history project  I’m fine I’m home now from school I’ve had such a bad day :( Well :/


Idk I’ve never taken whatever the v thing is called only Ritalin and adderall That's even better! Just go and talk to him/her about the issue you face. They will understand and they can't really do anything about it since it's you were diagnosed with a mental health problem. Just get the courage to talk to him/her. 

Asked them in class to speak with them outside of the class about an issue. Then tell him/her. If u can find him/her before class and the teacher is free, thats even better.

If you don't have the courage to tell the teacher, then go to the office and request for your parents to be called to leave the school for an issue (says you are feeling sick if you don't feel comfortable with them know about your mental health problem) and then email your teacher if you have their email.

You can also go early in the morning and find your history teacher and tell him/her. They will understand 1000%. I am at university and my profs understand. Profs are even worst than teachers! If they understand and are willing to help, teacher will definitely be better than the profs! Try and talk to your teachers, you have a diagnosis to back yourself up, if today was a bad day, tomorrow will be a good/better day, you'll see, keep at it dude! (I say while I procrastinate when I should be studying and taking care of uni assignments xD )do as I say and not as I do. If the going gets rough, squeeze the last sparks and see if you come up with something creative that could work, giving up is never the answer I carry an extra pill on me in my wallet. I just tuck it inside a cough drop wrapper.

in case I ever get drug searched I also keep a picture of my prescription on my phone. 

hope this trick helps in the future.


I have had those days and they are the worst Yeah ask your doctor about vyvanse it is far superior. But I recommend taking it as prescribed and not double dosing cause it sounds like you do that with adderall sometimes. It’s strong.  Ok thanks  Thanks I appreciate it :) Yeah they are :(


Thanks for the advice maybe I could put a extra pill in my backpack in a zip lock bag or something  Ok thanks
