LPT: If you find getting in to reading difficult try books based on movies you've seen. I've always read a lot but as I've gotten older I've found it more and more difficult. Even getting into movies and new tv series can be challenging. I find myself re-reading and re-watching things over and over instead of getting into new stuff. 

The problem for me is familiarity. If I don't connect with the character or plot right away I get distracted and lose interest. A trick I've learned (if this sort of thing happens to you) is reading books based on movies I've seen. It's a new experience (most books are usually different and better than their movie counterparts) but I adjust more quickly because I'm familiar with what I'm going in to. 

Give it a try and let me know if it works for you :D I don’t really read books but I read a lot of fan fiction. I get obsessed with specific characters and want to consume any media involving them. Some fanfics are better than a lot of published books. I use to buy the superhero book adaptations of the movies (Spider-Man, Transformers, X-Men...) it really was great I could visualize the characters very easily and the books added more depth because it has internal thoughts and such.

I thought about trying Game of Thrones, but those are big books and I haven’t sat down and read in a long time. I find it more difficult to actually finish the books... I have lots of half finished books!

But I would also suggest doing this. At least I think it’s really fun! That’s still reading though, just not in book form.
