I’m sorry to be a downer, but I’m tired of reading about how ADHD can be/is a gift. TL;DR: Just a rant about ADHD being shitty to have. Like why can’t I do stuff? I know how but I can’t DO it!! 

I get it, we get hyper focused on things we care about, we’re passionate and impulsive which can lead to a lot of creativity. 

But how many of us actually can get to a point in our lives where we can use that creativity at work? Where it matters? My life so far has been a cycle of fucking up all the time and having zero grit to finish anything. It doesn’t even feel like I don’t have motivation or focus, it feels like I literally can’t just do a simple thing that is important. I’m back to the point where I’m wondering if I’m just fucked in the head and don’t really have ADHD. I’m letting people that I love down, and that makes me really fucking sad and now they’re at a point where they see me as a lost cause because I can’t get a job, and haven’t had one for months.

My god man this shit is no gift, it can be a gift if you can get through the bullshit hoops of life and college. But if you make it to that point, can you even say you have ADHD? I’m sure a lot of you have/can, now that I think about it. I’m just so sad and angry right now about how easily discouraged and sensitive I am. My girlfriend even said I have no grit, and it hurt so bad so I fought back, but man she’s right! I don’t! Fuck...

I dunno. I’m just pissed off and ranting. Love you all. I just really needed to type these things out and put it in a place where I know people will understand, no one in my life does right now.  It is a gift

A gift from satan The gift mantra was concocted by Ed Hallowell over 20 years ago. He has written books etc. He has rode that horse and now it is dead. He never moved beyond this and he has not done much research. he has ADHD also. I attended a conference that he was the keynote speaker 20 years ago. I was not impressed. However, I also was fortunate to hear Dr Russell Barkey speak about ADHD and executive function. He was amazing. If I could, I would get rid of my ADHD in a heartbeat. It’s done nothing but screw me over in life.  Honestly, I don't think anyone can talk about how ADHD really makes it easier or harder to live unless they've lived without it and with it.

It's just like any other neurological or neurodevelopmental disorder: we can only guess how different it is and how much it would make life easier or harder overall. Sure, some are more clear-cut than others. But I don't know what I would be like if I didn't have ADHD. This is also something I've considered recently: how much of _me_ is my ADHD? Can I tell what's normal, what's ADHD, and what's my personality? The fact that they're all intertwined in my head makes it really hard for me to tell. I think my life is harder with ADHD, but I don't know what "benefits" I have over the normal person are from the ADHD or from my natural state.

Either way, it's more like a Fallout-style trait/perk where some things get a benefit and some things get a detriment. The difference is you can't choose it and you don't know what you got. I feel this. I’ve not had a single second to myself in a week to try and get everything to just shut up and I’m becoming borderline useless at both jobs because I can’t focus due to a lack of sleep which just aggravates my symptoms more.  [deleted] What do you all think of the Faster than Normal podcast by Peter Shankman?

He's got some interesting interviews which *are* a good listen, but the "it's a gift, don't medicate unless absolutely last resort and basically never kids" message he breathes is really frustrating IMHO.

I see where he's coming from, and he means well, but... It's very unscientific, but always presented as a morally sound "opinion" I've noticed.

Oh, and people like Shankman never seem to realize they're speaking from an already proven success and bias of it. It's like successful actors giving tips akin to "just work hard and follow your dreams, I did and see where that got me!". I am literally having  a fight with my gf about this right now. it fucking sucks. I just wish for one second I could experience what it's like the be normal. it's so fucking hard to do.

hyperfocus is fucking shit when youre trying to share a moment together. Ever watch a movie start analyzing it, focus in on a sentence the character said and try to figure out why they said that? only to find out that because of focus your girlfriend is feeling like you aren't interested in the movie?! fuck that shit. God hyperfocus sucks.  Feel like that a lot. I am a bitter man and it shows in my writing. I don't wanna be like that. But I feel I am on the downside of ADHD and like you said, for whatever traits we might have, I cannot apply them. And sometimes I see what people can do with their ADHD and I think...

... that the saying in a way turns out to be true, that 'God doesn't give you more than you can bear'. For some of us they have a fart of ADHD and complain how bad their life is. For others there is a thunderstorm and they can't get anything done. But it all scales with the person. 

That is when I wonder why I haven't capped my own ass. Apparently I can still bear it. 

But being this defective I fear one thing a lot. That on my death bed I will have nothing to look back on. What have I achieved? All I can say is that my defiant and standing on on the sideline of life has brought me some perspectives that are somewhat unique. There is a measure of wisdom. But that too can't be used.

This is no gift. So I'll share your rant.

Because ffs I can't see a positive to it all. And I cannot express something positive when I don't feel it.  You know, I agree. ADHD is a **bad** thing to have. Honestly I don't wish it upon anyone, which is why I won't ever have children of my own: I consider my genes flawed and don't want to risk having a son/daughter with ADD/ADHD. We are, indeed, unlucky to have it. And I'm sorry you had to go through it.

 However, in the face of the adversity created by ADHD, we do tend to develop pretty amazing traits. We can use these abilities for our betterment, and frankly, I think this is more meaningful in a way: The good things are **our merit**, not our genes', while the bad things? Those aren't ours, those are just an unlucky event that we happened to go through. Yeah, all it does is make life 10x more difficult. Agreed.  Fuck neurodiversity. I understand you're upset about the struggles you face, but yes, even if I finish college (and graduate school next week) I can say that yes, I really do have ADHD. I'm naturally bright and academically motivated, I'm very grateful for it.

However, I have few friends and have a good deal of behavioral issues. I will be 40 this year, and got diagnosed 1½ years ago, starting off (as many do) with depression. If anything, for now, it has made life more complicated. Many more appointments for a diagnosis, medication, help groups, trying to get people (family, colleagues) to understand, to even listen. It has answered some of my life questions, but has raised a whole lot more. What if's, although totally non productive, causing a cycle of depression and doubt. Everything I thought I knew is now up for re-evaluation, it's caused a serious life hiccup. Now having to come to terms with everything and discovering the person I should be, instead of the person I thought I should be, the personality I hid away to get through life without being ridiculed has to be rediscovered and tamed. It does explain some of my choices, behaviour, addiction etc, but I always thought "one day I will get my act together", knowing that this day will never completely happen was a heavy blow. I know also have the feeling that I have to start over, and don't particularly have a positive side to the symptoms. For me, it's other people that think I am great at what I do, I just feel like I'm just surviving and it costs me a great deal more energy to do what I do than a 'normal' person. This and the fact that it costs a great deal of energy to act 'normal' trying to navigate through relationships and life in general. Maybe one day my perspective will change, I don't know, but in my position it certainly does not feel like a gift.  I would consider the gifts of ADHD as consolation prizes. They in no way make up for the difficulties of ADHD but they have their moments. Stop trying to be normal.
 
I'm not saying we have a gift because we don't, we do have a disability. One that makes us function very different from "normal" people.

Our brains don't work like "normal" people's brain do, so we are expecting a great deal from ourselves by trying to join the ratrace that is every day life in our society. Maybe far to much to be frank. Why else do so many of us have the same problems. One of our issues is that we lack a filter that helps our brain sift out information in our brain not needed for the task at hand. So we have to interpret 100% of stimuli coming into our brains instead of 20%. That means we need more time and energy to process all that extra information. And that's just one way in which our brain works different.

Yes we can learn to work around it, but that will require some effort from your part. Look at it this way, your trying to live your life with the wrong instruction manual.  You are an Apple, and you were given an Android manual. They are very similar, but it will cause major problems in execution nonetheless.

I was in the same place as many of you are in this sub. 
Angry! Angry at myself for always walking one step out of beat with everything else! Angry at people around me because they didn't want to/couldn't understand me! Angry at the world for being  cold, harsh, unforgiving and denying me a place in it!

I kept fighting it. Went to therapy long before I got diagnosed, kept going after the diagnosis. I was struggling through school. In the end, I lost my GF with who I lived together for four years and in that same process turned homeless, lost all my "friends", failed to pass my exams, was a general fuck up in life at age 33 and even got a major burn-out to deal with after all that other shit...

Now it's all the opposite. I'm in a loving relationship, I've found work that suits my needs, it's the life I've always wanted to have but was never been able to reach. How?

By embracing the fact I have ADD. I know, it sounds counterintuitive, but that little fact has been such a life changer for me, because I was finally able to accept myself fully for the first time in my life! And not being able to accept myself fully is what was holding me back and was making me so angry.
Again, I'm not saying it's a gift because it isn't and it is neither an easy process, but it's worth it. 

For me, solving my negative way of thinking first kickstarted the healing process, along with stopping regular meds. But that's my road, there are plenty of people who apparently do well on meds. I'm just not one of them.

I wish I could make you know, feel and see what I do. Life is so much better now and I wish that for all my fellow AD(H)D'ers. But this is a road you have to find and travel for yourself, since it's a different road for everyone. 
What I can say is educate yourself. Read everything about the subject, talk to experts (either educated professional therapists or fellow AD(H)D'ers), do what you can to learn about yourself and the way your mind works and how it differs from "normal" people. Give yourself permission to fuck up once in a while, you don't have to be perfect. 

And please, stop comparing yourself to "normal" people, stop blaming and hating yourself you can't live up to their standards, because you can't. I've tried for 33 years and it got me nowhere fast! I know it's difficult when you see so much people around you succeeding where you fail, but remember the wrong instruction manual...

Hmm, this turned out rather lengthy. My apologies for the long read. I hope I got my point across and didn't come over as some know it all asshole. I just wanted to share my experiences.

Edit: I'm not saying I'm not having any problems anymore, I certainly do. It's just that it's not all negative all the time anymore. If I experience a symptom, it's that, a symptom. I didn't fuck up, I'm not dumb for doing it wrong, just had an ADD moment and that's ok. No need to chastise myself over it. i have never heard this for some reason and have been down on myself for believing i have a disability. can anyone point me to some of this "its a gift stuff" The only sense in which it’s a gift is that it’s an obstacle to overcome. And I do believe that overcoming obstacles can be good for you and build character and recognize the struggle inherent in life in way earlier than life hammers some other people. But honestly I’ve also seen people who got hit by a car, got paralyzed, and say that experience made them live far richer and happier lives. I believe that. But one would hardly call being hit by a car a gift.  I guess it can be a gift in certain specific situations(different specific jobs etc) but most usually not... * I can sort of see how the way I think can be a gift. I've always been good at seeing connections and approaching things from various angels.

But idk whether that's because of ADHD or not....

* ADHD has also taught me to compartmentalise. But simply because I'd be... Idk. In a **really** bad place if I hadn't...

* But what I suffer from most is probably procrastination, being chaotic, careless mistakes and ADHD induced anxiety. Treatment has helped but they're still there.

These things aren't gifts. There is **no** positive spin I could give them. They suck.

* The loneliness, feelings of inadequacy, shame, self-doubt, the money and time (oh gosh, the time!!) lost to adhd and the health issues aren't positive either. And I've also disappointed / hurt others. Due to things that did indeed come from an undiagnosed ADHD (imo.)

So yeah, I agree with you.

 It's a difficult question, because no one really knows what parts of a person are the ADHD and what aren't.  Without this there's no way I'd say take away my ADHD, because I don't know what I'd be signing up to.

Those that say it's a gift are obviously successful, and are assuming the things that have made them that way are part of the ADHD.  No one knows though. This needed to be said. I get that people are tryna be positive, but I'm sorry but ADHD is anything but a gift.  I'm happy I found the meds that work for me, don't take my meds away or my life will crumble  I, like some (many?) here, share your frustration. I was having this exact argument with a friend of mine the other day - she thinks ADHD has perks and that the problem with our brains is entirely social. So basically, there is no problem with our brain. I don't think our friendship is the same after learning that...

Having ADHD has ruined a lot of stuff in my life. It has also forced me to learn a lot of useful things in order to cope, sure, but in itself it brings me no good. It has played a major part in ruining every single relationship of mine (romantic or not). I think it makes more sense to say that ADHD is a disorder that comes with gifts.  The ADHD is the bad part of the package.

Maybe there is a better way to word that. THANK YOU. I feel this way about my ADHD and other mental illnesses. They're not a "gift" or a "special ability" it's burden and an inconvenience and I would be in a MUCH different/better place in my life without it. I've come to terms and accepted it but that doesn't mean I have to love it. Those who say it’s a gift don’t understand the struggle that comes with it. I don’t see it as a gift, but I don’t see it as a curse, either. It simply is what it is.

That being said, living with ADHD is all I know, so I really can’t say anything about living without it. I think those things that give all the "positives of ADHD" are usually to give some positive light on the people with ADHD to not completely hate themselves. An example is like "I hate ADHD, but at least I'm creative because of it!" I see what you mean, and I'm not disagreeing with your statement, because part of me does feel the same way. Because in the end, ADHD sucks, a lot, and it shouldn't be viewed as a superpower, because its far from that. My point is, yes, ADHD isn't something to want, because it absolutely is terrible to live with. There are some positive traits, but the cons largely outweigh the pros for sure.

Also, I hope you can find a solution to ur problems. I truly hope you can find the light at the end of the tunnel, and not stay stuck in this situation. Good luck! Let’s not forget that back then it was a gift. People with ADHD were more alert at all times and survived better than “normal people”. It is only this way now because of the way humans have taken control of the planet. Now were supposed to focus and do everything like them. It can still be used as a good thing..just less now than it was back then. One of the worst things is having to wonder "is this a condition? or am I just a chronic fuck up with nothing to blame but myself?"

Pretty hard to deal with when you're tacitly told all the time that what you're going through isn't real.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBA6ev5HMe4 This is the most realistic view of the "gift" approach. You actually made me lol.  Upvotes for you! I watched one of Dr. Barkley’s speeches about how ADHD is actually an Executive Functioning problem. I only watched the speech on YouTube, but that man really knows what’s up, probably one of the best public speakers I have ever listened to. 

I think he has a more realistic outlook. It’s not a gift, but a disability. But like any disability you can work around it and do what you can, but you have to be real about it. Barkley is very informative but he basically says that we're less human.  

ADHD *is* a disorder but the people who have it aren't straight up inferior.  We're different and the disorder is part of the differences. Despite how a lot of people on here think of them, Hallowell and Barkley are not opposing forces in the ADHD world. While Hallowell does emphasize the "gift" potential and Barkley the impairment, they are both clear about the fact that for any individual person it's not as black-and-white as either/or. Barkley's main work is research and focuses on the impairments affecting populations with ADHD. Hallowell focuses on the individual as he works as a practitioner with patients and has to help them navigate and take a perspective that can help them accept and learn to work with their ADHD. 

They joined forces for a discussion at a CHADD event in 2011 and the summary helps to clarify and correct the way people tend to pit them against one another: [http://www.chadd.org/AttentionPDFs/ATTN_02_12_NeitherGiftNorCurse.pdf](http://www.chadd.org/AttentionPDFs/ATTN_02_12_NeitherGiftNorCurse.pdf) Everything you is your ADHD. Everything you think and are is affected by it because who you are for the largest part is your brain...and how it functions..or lacks function. There is no trait that won't be affected by it. All the things you are good at, without ADHD they would be better. The things you are bad at, are made worse by it.

How can you be another you when you will never be another you. The whole concept of making this Devil's Advocate logical fallacy...hmm...interesting....I'll call it that from now on... seerves nothing but double think in an inconsistent way.

Because see, *when it is* ***good****, it is my special ADHD ability, an ability enhanced by it which gives me an edge over others, when it is* ***bad*** \- and now the terrible conclusion \- *it must be a character flaw.*

Oh but wait. We don't like to say that about ourselves. Hence the inconsistency, because then you get: *when it is* ***good****, it is my splendid personality, when it is* ***bad*** *it must be my ADHD.*

And so you can take the first good and swap it with the second and do the same with the bad. So basically when it is good it is your ADHD and when it is bad it is also your ADHD. And when it is good it is your personality and when it is bad, also your personality.

So what have you actually gained or lost? Nothing.

It is all affected by ADHD. So let go of the intertwined. There is no such thing. It is a seamless whole. There is no distinction. 

*Even if you had a personality not being influenced by the brain, apart from the brain, what does that gain you?* 

Precious nothing. Because all people on Earth can boast about their marvelous personality traits. But when you cannot express them because of the typical ADHD impairments, inhibitions, anxieties, co\-morbid dx's and so on and so forth, they are all but vague and hazy notions. Things get real when they can be of service. 

Take me. I feel empathy for people. I have a 'big heart'. But I can never give a hug, put my hand on a shoulder in support or understanding. It is a *hidden trait.* As such, just a potential thing. Not of use to myself or others. If this is so, is it really a trait or just a fancy notion I like to maintain about myself?

If we all start talking about personalities we are all genuine Ghandi's. When it comes to wisdom, genuine Buddha's. When it comes to IQ: 

"A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep."

\-\- Saul Bellow

“No one is satisfied with his fortune, nor dissatisfied with his intellect”

\-\- Antoinette Deshoulieres

And cue in Dunner\-Krüger.

When people oppose good to bad they see only half the world. Every good must be counter\-weighted by a bad and every bad, with a good. It is like cross\-wise multiplication. There are two numbers above the divide\-line and two below it. 1/3 X 4/8=? How do you solve this. The 1 must be equalized to the 8. The 3 to the 4. Only then you see reality as a whole.

There are good sides and bad sides, but every of those had in it as well its own opposite.

You can be a loving mother. But also smothering with love. You can be impatient. But also have a quick wit or comeback. But as you smother with love, you can be protective and when you have a quick wit, you may also put a foot in your mouth.

And so on, ad infinitum. 

We must all stop thinking in terms that recognize only half the world. We are not machines built of parts. We are a seamless transition, a process of becoming and forever a temporary conclusion. So there is no ADHD apart from you nor is there a division along personality traits and abilities. I love this! That analogy is really cool (because I love fallout) and it makes good sense. I get you about not knowing what it’s like to be regular, but your take on it is more positive than mine at the moment haha. I wonder how different it is? Maybe it’s like a blind person trying to understand color or something. I’ve asked my girlfriend if her mind races too, she says she doesn’t think about anything most of the time. I don’t know if that’s normal, but I’m jealous if that’s really a thing. I can not imagine not thinking every waking second of my day, it’s hard to explain what I mean...it’s like a person with 3 legs trying to imagine life with 2 legs. 
I can’t even comprehend what a quiet moment in my head would be like, I mean what would I be thinking about?! Ha! It’s weird, I actually seem to focus a little better when I’m sleep deprived. It seems like my brain is a little quieter and easy to work with.  And I get you on the “shut up” part, man it’s fucking annoying. I’ll be thinking about something like Dolphin intelligence, I wonder if maybe they could have had a civilization? And then I realize I’ve spent 20 minutes on the thought and I have shit to do! Haha This has been my experience too. People find the ‘quirks’ very interesting, and tend to create positive associations because of them.

That said, I only feel the benefits when I’m managing to deal with everything well, which happens like, half the time. 

I feel like there’s a good balance of ‘ADHD is a gift’ and ‘ADHD is a disability’ posts on here, so whichever one I need at the time, I can find. If I’m doing poorly, I just ignore the ones about ADHD being amazing, and it’s not hard to find support and advice. When I’m already doing kind of well, the posts about ADHD being great give me a boost by making me feel better about myself.

I would never dream of criticizing one type of post over the other, because they’re both useful to different people in different places.


It’s also important to consider support networks; I’m going to finish college (knock on wood) and I’ll still have ADHD, but I also have supportive parents who help me through the rough spots, and people in general are more willing to help me and accept my faults because of the way they think of me, which I think is somehow linked to ADHD and the fact that I’m a petite tomboyish woman.


When I’m already doing great, I know that thinking ‘wow, I sure do have a disability’ isn’t going to help. Thinking, ‘now that my ADHD is well managed, I’m able to benefit from it’ does. Whether or not that is actually true. The other option is reckoning with the possibility that I would be just as smart, just as creative, just as curious, and therefore more successful without it. That line of thinking will never be productive, so at some point in management (which I have so far found to be non-linear) ‘adhd is a gift’ posts become valuable. In small doses, quirks can be endearing.  In larger or more frequent doses, they annoy, frustrate and/or piss off everyone.  Nice humblebrag  It's pure bullshit. Any single person who is succesful and writes a book about how to achieve it based on a population of 1 is delusional.  :/ it would drive me crazy if my boyfriend picked fights about such things. Fortunately he knows a lot about adhd and is patient with me.
 I think we don’t lack the ability to learn. We just don’t do well in super cookie cutter environments like schools and I’ll be homeschooling my kids. Like, i know ADHD is bad, but I honestly don’t know anyone who hasn’t inherited some whammy from their parents, like an elevated risk of breast cancer or Alzheimer’s. I know I’m pretty healthy outside of ADHD, and to each their own, but I don’t think having ADHD is worse than developing breast cancer. In other words, it’s bad in my opinion, but it’s not so uniquely bad that I shouldn’t reproduce.  I’m not personally closed to the idea of having kids that could be passed my ADHD, only because I would have no problem with treating it early on. I wasn’t diagnosed til 21, and I didn’t really know what was wrong with me until I was a sophomore in HS. That led to a lot of other problems that are probably worse than ADHD at this point. I see ADHD as kind of a “gateway drug” to other, much worse mental problems. Especially if you don’t know that you have it all through school, or your parents refuse to treat it like mine did. I like your point though, it’s something I’ll have to consider if I’m ever at that point in life. 

I love your outlook though, the merit part is really sweet in a way. I’d love to do something meaningful with the good traits I’ve developed, I just don’t know where to start anymore. 

 Read 'Scattered' by Gabor Maté. ADHD is not all genetic, it's more determined by early childhood experiences, which tend to get passed on through parent behaviour, more than through genes. Also the traits we struggle with are the same ones that Google's AI program is working to make obsolete  I could not think any more different then you. I believe that ADD is the way of the future, I believe that we will see more and more children having ADD in the future as it is the evolution of the human brain as it adapts to the hyper stimulating environments we are living in with so much information coming at us. Technology is changing our environments at such a rapid pace and there are more and more things coming at us, I have actually found it easier to live with ADD as time progresses. I know a lot of people are quite negative in this thread towards their condition, but I have thrived due to my ADD and I think there will be more like me in the future. The problem I see with ADD is that society is still at a crossroads of the tech revolution. Soon I see our education system adapting to be videogames and VR which can teach us at a much faster pace and are more geared towards those with our conditions, not paper and books that many of us tend to struggle with. Our education system simply runs too slow for many of us to keep our attention.

We develop amazing traits in the face of adversity. So true, the problem is that the education system as it stands is not geared towards us and often does not stress or challenge us enough to press that adversity and make us develop those traits you speak of. Fuck people who are trying to normalize real mental issues that plague people's lives because BIG PHARMA.  This. We need to stop trying to force ourselves into the lives we *think* we should live and find the lives that works for us and our brains.

Your brain doesn't let you sit at a desk for 8 hours a day updating spreadsheets? Then *don't*. Work on finding something that you like and your brain lets you do, and accept that it may not be the same thing 8 years from now. To be honest, the central issue of my life all seems to be about feelings of shame and anxiety that I'll never be able to secure a career that I can get on with without getting too stressed or bored. Seems like there must be something out there suited to someone with ADHD, which pays decently and doesn't require mountains of study. I'm on a degree course to be a speech therapist at the moment (almost finished 2nd year, 1 more to go) and honestly, by this point I thought I would be happy I was on the path to achieving this goal, but I spend more time than ever fantasizing about the kind of life I want + envying others I see who've achieved financial security. I just don't think I'm suited to doing something like this with the need to constantly be organised and interact with a lot of people and keep a million things in memory. What job did you do and what would you suggest? Honestly I’ve heard it and read it in so many articles and speeches that I can’t name anything off the top of my head besides the ADDitude website. They have a lot of great content, it’s all ADHD related. But some of it is that “gift” bull crap that is spoken by people who may technically have ADHD but it really doesn’t affect them that profoundly. Reading that shit is like looking at the productivity sub. A bunch of “you can do it! I did !” Type shit. May I ask which med worked for you? My main issues are also lack of motivation and anxiety-driven procrastination. Hopefully if something helped you with those symptoms it could do me a solid I've not heard this before.  I've heard more that ADHD people were less likely to survive, but saved others and helped develop understanding by being the dangerous risk takers. Yes! I think that it most likely was a good trait when our lives were centered around hunting and gathering, life or death type stuff. I have worked in fire, and as much as I’d love to do something “smarter”, I have never excelled more anywhere else in my life. In fire (wildland) I get to hike around and see cool shit, and there’s always that danger to be aware of, I love it. I hope I can do something else some day, I’d love to be an astronomer or engineer. Too bad I suck at math Have you got any sources to back this up? I can see some logic in it but honestly, people like us are just more likely to die and teach others a lesson (look at where you go when running or you might just fall into the cliff after the tall grass OR that cute dotted animal (aka jaguar) is not be poked, as we learned from that crazy mate who did just that and died horribly). I remember seeing another post here saying the fact no one tends to recognise or even know about these difficulties is one of the hardest things about the disorder. You're not alone, I feel the exact same way I get it. It sucks monkey balls. I also have to manage it alongside severe depression and anxiety. I don’t see it as a gift I see it as a reason why so much shit in my past we’re sick a clusterfuck and why I can’t keep my damn house clean. 

But then you got people think you’re using it as a crutch or excuse. 

I think all you can do is treat it how you feel is best (medication, natural supplements, counseling, whatever it may be) and try not to let it control you. 

Yeah it’s hard as hell, but you CAN take your life back. I promise.  He is amazing. I have all his very expensive books. They are filled with current research. I used them in my doctoral program. One is signed. There are a group of ADHD researchers and they collectively are known as the grey beards.  Also take note of Thomas E. Brown if you like Barkley. Similar perspective, slight differences or emphases. Yes, Hallowell is a practitioner. However, his line is no longer accepted by CHADD. I don’t think he has been invited back since then. I have been involved in CHADD and was recognized as their Teacher of the Year. I am well aware of CHADD becoming more research oriented in their approach and moving far away from the ‘gift’ approach to dealing with ADHD it’s diagnosis and treatment. Yes that is normal. And I can't comprehend it. Or maybe cognitively understand. But not experiential.  I mean, *cogito ergo sum*: I think, therefore, I am. If I were to stop thinking, what would I be? I'm waiting for this effect right now.  1:21 in the morning, and i'm hoping that soon my fatigue will hit a point where I only have the strength to do one thing, and then I try to make that one thing be my work.  It is miserable, having to wait until you are almost too tired to function, just to be able to function... **magic hour** ; my eyes are currently blood shot from irregular sleep patterns because the only time I can focus is around this time(currently 1:00am), I’ve stopped trying to fight an uphill battle of doing freelance illustrations in the day, as I always feel fatigued and useless and trying to force myself feels like an actual impossible task. I flounder about trying to sleep and fail to sleep and then the quiet hours in the dead of night when my mind can finally work, and I’m half asleep. 
**magic hour** 

I absolutely hate it to be honest but it is what it is 

 Can confirm: I work better sleep deprived  I like what you said here. I think I’m in a rut at the moment, I’ve been in the same place where I’m looking through the “ADHD is a gift” perspective. But that’s when things are going well. I hope that some day, I can be somewhere in the middle. I’m getting tired of not being able to manage anything with true consistency in my life. I’m hopeful and optimistic that the day will come soon. 

Congrats on college btw!  I totally agree with your reasoning that if you think it's only a detriment you'll just pity yourself no matter how successful you are.

Additionally, I just realized that I should try and see if my "quirks" are seen as such by others. One quirk I know I have that is very rude and I absolutely hate is that I often interrupt people when I (think I) know what they're going to say (I'm often right) or I try to complete their sentences; it makes me feel awful and others get angry because it's really rude but I try to apologize and explain that I'm not trying to but luckily it's mostly with people who know me. [deleted] she is patient with me, it's been 6 years and I've known her since childhood. it's just understandably exhausting.  If you caught ADHD in your children early that doesn't mean they can be shielded from the impairments and the pain. Maybe you could medicate them and shield them somewhat. But what if they belong to the group where meds don't work *at all*? Which is iirc around 30&#37;.  Exactly this indeed!

But that's more easily said than done. It took me a few years to build the confidence to do just that, but it was well worth it!  >I just don't think I'm suited to doing something like this with the need to constantly be organised and interact with a lot of people and keep a million things in memory.

This is what got me also. I was studying to be therapist for people with psychological disorders. And I was very good at the therapy part. It was all the planning, organizing and dealing with my colleagues that got to me. I didn't do really good at school neither. Had trouble finishing assignments and such.

First off, I'm from the Netherlands, just so you know. 

For me a job with a lot of physical activity is preferable. I know it's not a pathway to a successful career where I can make lots of money, but tbh I don't care about that. If I can make enough to earn a decent living for my family, I'm good!

Atm I'm recovering from a burn-out. I work 20 hrs a week, learning the bicycle repair trade. It's the Netherlands, so there's a plethora of bikes here. The town where I live doesn't have a bicycle repair shop and plenty of school going kids with bikes. 
The rest of my time I now spend on learning how to mod PS controllers and consoles. When I've learned that, I'm moving on to Xbox.

The point is, I'm doing what makes me happy. I love tinkering with and repairing my own bike. I've been gaming since I was 7, I turn 37 in 2 weeks so you could call that a passion I guess lol. 
The therapist thing was something to start a career, I was good at it. But it wasn't making me happy. 

I can't suggest a career choice for you. All I can do is say look into your hart and find something you love to do and go with that. Life is too short to spend your life trying to fit into a society not build for us. Find out your strengths and weaknesses, your passion and trust that those thing are enough to get you to a place where you can be happy and pleased with yourself. 

I do have to ADD (lol) that I first had to work on my debilitating problems. Indirectly caused by ADD, my insecurity and the gift to turn évery thought into a negative one were remnants of my 33 years of living with the wrong instruction manual and one of the reasons foir my burn-out. And they were still so pervasive that they were hindering me in my progress.  Yes, people use themselves as the measuring stick against which all others are laid. ADHD is a spectrum in terms of symptoms but also in severity. Methylphenidat helped with many issues.


things are just... Easier. It takes less mental effort to do things / get myself to do things. I'm also much more clear headed and am much better at concentrating. )

But what helps just as much is structuring my environment and removing pretty much everything I could use to procrastinate. And sports.


Things like cold turkey and similar app / website blockers are helpful as well.

Being extremely bored does tend to make me more productive. 

Boring my procrastination habit to death (basically) https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-is-adhd-an-evolutionary-advantage I mean, part of the struggle is that it IS your life. Unless we can cure it, you're stuck with it. So it's like recognizing that your world is going to be very different from everyone else's and trying to cope with that. > I don’t think he has been invited back since then.

As professional organizations go, I'm not sure that's a useful indicator. They can't just keep inviting the same high-profile experts every year. I have no idea how much CHADD ever endorsed the gift perspective, but in their [weekly newsletter just last year](http://www.chadd.org/Understanding-ADHD/About-ADHD/ADHD-Weekly/Article.aspx?issue=d2017-01-19&id=234) they were still writing about the overlap between Barkley and Hallowell and reiterating the overlap in their perspectives (also citing the 2011 piece). Yeah it is. I think a lot of it is the stress of being tired and knowing how it might affect you. For some reason it helps a ton, but man, so unhealthy  It really didn’t come across that way to me. I also say I’m a smallish cute woman because.. well.. I’m a smallish cute woman. Having a bit of confidence and self worth isn’t bragging lmao, you do you! That's really awesome. Good that I avoided making any assumptions about your girlfriend  It's <10%. Not refuting your argument though. Thanks for writing this. It makes me happy to know a person out there struggling from similar issues has made a situation where they're happy in themselves and not having to force anything that isn't natural and comfortable. Thanks for the link!

Didn't watch the video, but reading the sources they all seem to base the beneficial evolutionary traits in the gene DRD4, and there's strong evidence that changes in this gene are *one of the* causes of ADHD. But that gene alone doesn't tell the whole story of ADHD... What do you think?

This is what I'm reading:

I'm also gonna mention that Dr russel barkley briefly mentions this [in one of his talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCAGc-rkIfo) (which is very long and I don't remember exactly where he mentions it - but it's worth watching anyway) and he totally discredits this.

(edit: formatting)  Yup I 100% agree with you. I take medication for mine which helps, but not all the way. I think educating people about it is all we can do, really, which is near impossible sometimes. 

But you’re not alone- so have some comfort in that :) It feels like to get to everyone else's level I deplete all my mana, and never have enough left for the super moves in life. And that’s one of the hardest parts for me I’ve realized. You're welcome! I keep trying to tell my story, hopefully inspiring people in this sub and trying to say that even though things seem shitty and unbearable at times, you can make it work. But not without putting in effort yourself... 

May seem unfair, probably is, but that's the way it is... one more, with another perspective: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1578754/ Ahaha I didn’t watch the video either, my ADHD wouldn’t let me lol. I will read up all of your links later! This.  Whoa.. videos are hard sometimes! no pressure to read the sources, although it'd be nice to hear the thoughts of someone that has more faith in the possible evolutionary benefits of ADHD, and is also willing to do fact checking!

cheers
