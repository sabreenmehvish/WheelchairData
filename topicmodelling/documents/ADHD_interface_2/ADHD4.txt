Professor inadvertently told the whole class about my accommodations and I’m super embarrassed Today was my first day of college and in my freshman writing seminar we were going over the syllabus.The teacher went over her tech policy which is basically ‘no tech unless we have a conversation about it first’. Well I had already had a conversation with her about using my laptop for note taking and she agreed to let me use it as an accommodation. A classmate also asked for a technology accommodation in the form of a voice recorder. Well while reading the syllabus she mentions that 3 students are allowed to use technology accommodations and only them because they had learning disabilities. Cue to the whole class looking at me and the classmate with the voice recorder while the third student hides their laptop. I feel so embarrassed and I don’t know what to do. I kind of want to never use my laptop in that class again but I wouldn’t be able to learn a new note taking style that works for me fast enough. :( What the hell is wrong with people? I'm a high school special education teacher and I do everything possible to minimize stigma for my kids. I would definitely bring it up with him or his department head - if not for your sake but for the poor souls taking his class in the future to prevent this from happening again. I'm sorry this happened.  Maybe go to your disabilities office and speak to whoever helped you get your accommodations set up. I think someone from their office should have a conversation with your teacher, what she did was really inappropriate. It sounds to me like the instructor made an honest mistake of tact. That's not excuse, though, so I hope they're reminded somehow that what they did wasn't really OK. That said... Cat's out of the bag. People will judge for one reason or another regardless of whether or not no someone had a learning disability. Do you want to make it through school or cave to the embarrassment? Seriously, I think the best thing you can do now is own it. Hell if you DIDN'T use it some people may think you never actually needed it and/or your grades could suffer badly.


I'm sorry this happened. It's not how this is supposed to go. It sucks. But it'll pass and everyone will get used to it. Look ahead and take good notes, ON YOUR LAPTOP!  First off - that sucks to hear. Your teacher has gotta learn some tact.  


But this might be a blessing in disguise. I needed accommodations in college too but I didn't like the social stigma. When I did finally start using them, people didn't care that much and actually it helped me make a few friends. 

&#x200B;

Embrace it, use it to your advantage, and keep your head up :) If people ask about it, just be humble and say you're a bit slower than average. People will start rooting for you once they get to know you :) College professor here. Trust me when I say that most students are so busy just trying to succeed in the class that other people's accommodations are really not that big of a deal to them.

Additionally, my students with accommodations stand out to me because of the extra effort they are making to succeed, and the courage it took to admit to themselves in the first place that they needed them. You're climbing the same mountain as the rest of them, but with asthma. The fact that you can get there is a testament to how much stronger you can be than any of them. That sucks! Tell her how it made you feel. She wont make the mistake again and added bonus will be sympathetic learning!

BTW interesting to hear you use your laptop as assistance. When I was at Uni laptop = distraction As an adjunct professor (aka a somewhat real one), this professor of yours definitely made a mistake. A couple of thoughts:
1. Hope it was an honest mistake (maybe she/he is new? Super nervous? Idk? As an adjunct i didn’t get any proper training on basic things like this which doesn’t make it right but just cool to note) and based on what your natural personality is, it might be productive to help educate him on the what his actions resulted in. Based on their response hopefully you feel better. If they seem like a dick, yeah, go to the dept head. 

2. I agree w the people here who take the notion of, this is what you need and that is what matters. This is your education and your sole and full attention on that no matter what accommodations is the most important. 

Good luck and chin up!  She. Fucked. Up.  I’m so angry for you.  

1. I would go and let your Office of Student Affairs (or whoever it is that houses your disability service center.)  she is not allowed to disclose that information. 

2. Technology is a universal accommodation, screw her for taking it away from others. That’s shitty teaching at its finest. 

3. Don’t forget that this disability is a part of the wonderful person you are. You are not any less of a person or  any less capable of learning because you need a computer to help get you organized. It doesn’t have to be embarrassing... but she doesn’t get to make that call for you.  Hey, listen. You DO have a disability. It's nothing to be ashamed of, and it's nothing to be embarrassed about. You have a disability in this area, but I imagine you have so many other talents. Use your laptop with pride, allow yourself to accept the fact you're being accommodated so that you can SUCCEED, and to hell with what anyone else may think. Who knows, maybe you have given someone in your class the courage to speak about their own disability and also make use of the accommodation rule. USE your lap top, do well, ace the class, do you at all costs. Do NOT let your peers or otherwise make you feel as though you should be ashamed for needed assistance in a world that is geared towards people who function in a different way.  I feel like she should have just left out the “because of learning disabilities” and maybe not included an exact number. “A small group of students have outstanding circumstances, and have been admitted to use electronics” would suffice.

Aside: I hate when teachers just flat out ban any electronic for note taking. All of my classes at least have a tech zone.  my professor did this in front of a lecture hall sophomore year. long story short, go to your dean of students and have them deal with this because this is not a small matter. this professor needs to know that what they did is not okay in order to ensure something like this does not happen again. UPDATE: I had a talk with the professor after class today and she was extremely apologetic. She said she didn’t realize that it would be something I would be embarrassed about but she understands now that I want to keep it private. During the conversation she tried to talk to me about that I shouldn’t be scared to hide and that using accommodations is common. I feel a bit better now and I don’t plan on bringing it up to my disability counselor unless she slips up again and makes another comment about my or another student’s disabilities. Thank you everyone for you kind comments and suggestions I love this subreddit and how supportive it is :) As regards everyone looking at you, please don’t assume they think it’s a big deal. A fair number of them will have ADHD, dyslexia, depression, Aspergers etc etc.

Some will be thinking - whoops I forgot to ask for a laptop... maybe I should up my meds.  

I got my knickers in a twist about whether to tell people or not - honestly 95% of people I tell either have direct experience of mental health issues or have a first degree relative with mental health issues.  Don't let it get to you, man. You do you and everyone else can piss off. If it helps you be better at your studies, take it. Do NOT let other peoples judgement take that away. 

Fuck to the no.  I've found that in college, there are probably many students who are supportive of you and whatever you need to do to get through college. What the professor did was still inappropriate and honestly, they probably weren't thinking. But if you are worried about your classmates, I'm willing to bet that they don't mind you having accommodations. College is hard enough, you know? Do what you gotta do to make it!  probably an honest mistake, and i understand why you're embarrassed... but don't be? what's so embarrassing? i openly tell people about my accommodations for exams and stuff, people always ask why i'm never in the main venue so i just tell them.

also genuinely no one cares at uni/college about disabilities/problems/mental health/disorders. no one's gonna take the piss.
only annoying thing is calling it a learning disability when it technically isn't Seems like a violation of privacy Yeah that kinda sucks, but you should just own it! Everyone has issues, yours is adhd (same with me). You aren't any less of a person for it, you're going to college and overcoming your challenges!! You'll do great but don't worry about it :) That sucks. I would have been embarrassed as well. Remember your intelligence, you got into that college which makes you a good fit for that class.  So fuck that professor.   


Also, college is not like high school. People were much less judgmental in college than they were in high school.   Best of luck.  I know it sucks now and you'll think about it for a while, but it will be just this semester and you'll most likely never see any of those people again. Also give it another week or two and the class will probably be half empty anyway and the other half will forget.  honestly this was an idiotic mistake by the professor that should not have happened. but people are idiots and all you can do is control your self and your future. the other kids on the class honestly probably dont give a shit, you will have many more classes, many more opportunities to meet people, and move on from this. own what you are and let people think they know about you. it doesnt change anything. be strong and carry on, youre there for your education not to control others thoughts about you. Good Luck! blek.

Personally I feel a pocket notebook is the best for my ADHD. But I grew up in the 90s - a wasteland of technology. wha...why?! that is like inconceivable thoughtless. Additionally, I don't understand why adult students would instantly turn around to try to figure out who their disabled peers are. Yep, The teacher messed up, but it could be an honest mistake.

Just remember that you are the one that is you who is going to draw the value out of the class. If you need a laptop, a recorder or an emotional support ferret to get the most out of it, please do so. Remember that you are paying money and time to get an education so you shouldn’t be embarrassed. 

Go kill it, get an A and enjoy it! 

Friendly advise: just ask but don’t expect such accommodations in the “real world”.  This has happened to me. It was pretty mortifying I teach college. This is a completely unacceptable violation of your privacy and possibly even *illegal*. Still, it was most likely an honest mistake. I'd definitely bring it up with the instructor. If they are apologetic, I'd let it drop. If not, you'd be doing the right thing to pursue this. (This should be freaking obvious, though! As a first-year grad TA I had more sense than that...)

The correct phrasing for the instructor to refuse to say "no technology outside of exceptional circumstances". Then, if any student asks why someone else if getting this (this has never happened to me) just state that you cannot discuss details for other students. Believe this is against the Title rules ...contact your disabilities counselor. 

Note: I'm a professor at a private university and I'm not allowed to disclose any disabilities to other students or staff/faculty.  Lol, I feel like professors do this to make sure that other people dont make excuses. But, I don't understand the whole no tech rule in the first place. The hell with the rest of them. You're there for YOUR education. Don't stress what others think. You might not even see any of them again once you pass this class. Take care of yourself first.

Not saying what the professor did was good or okay.  Rub your laptop use in everyone's face and laugh all the way to an A+ That's awful. I'm a senior in college and have NEVER seen a professor do that regarding my accommodations (or anyone else's in the classes I've been in).

​

I did have a professor that used a cane for walking/standing give me shit about taking the test and returning it to his hands in the classroom before the class was over and not sliding it under a door due to his physical disability. This doesn't seem unreasonable at first glance, but two of my accommodations are extra test time and a reduced-distraction environment. I couldn't start my exams early because I had a class right before this professor's class with only a 15 minute break in between, which meant that I couldn't have extra time in order to hand-deliver my test back to him before the class was over and would actually end up having ***less*** time to take the test than the rest of the class. He wouldn't accept it being delivered to his department mailbox despite it being height-appropriate to where he wouldn't struggle to bend over and pick up the test like he would if someone were to slide it under his office door. I decided to not use accommodations for his class (differential equations and linear algebra) and ended up with a lower grade than what I normally get with accommodations. I understand his disability-based need, but am still frustrated with his inability to be flexible in a way that was able to accommodate both of our needs. I didn't bring the issue to the attention of the DSS office because I didn't want to cause any problems during my first semester at the university, and I wasn't really aware of what my rights were at the time.

​

What the professor you are dealing with did is unfortunate. While many of us with ADHD have no problem identifying openly as such (or disabled), many of us are still uncomfortable with it because it continues to be widely stigmatized and misunderstood. If you feel comfortable enough, I recommend you approach this professor in private to discuss what happened. At the very least, she needs to be educated. If you don't feel comfortable talking to her yourself, report the incident to the DSS office. If you don't feel comfortable with either approach, just try to brush it off. Wait, it's 2018 and you can't take notes in class with a laptop?  And not even a voice recorder, even though the benefits are completely obvious for everyone?  Why?   People like to think that ADHD meds and accommodations give those students an advantage.  That’s like thinking that giving someone asthma medicine would give someone with an advantage in a race.  Be proud of who you are and what you’ve accomplished. If you don’t make it a big deal, others won’t either.  UGH! 

It's astounding how mindless/mind-blind some of the most educated individuals can be.

As the others have mentioned take this up with the student services office responsible for accessibility matters. Don't go to the Prof. yourself as a it might not turn out as you'd like it to.

If people target you, or "resent" you then you know that you don't have to invite these people in to your life. Work with them on a need to basis, and don't make time for them or their opinions.

**be aware** that some people's interest in your "situation" may come from an interest in what medications you are on. This happened to me in a recent class where someone approached me with "I noticed you use a laptop and a recorder in class, is this because you have adhd?" and then followed up with "Oh I may have that too, what medications are you on?" I've seen far too many examples (both here and personally) of people interested in ways and means of getting access to stimulant medication when they do not have an adhd diagnosis. **You don't need to reveal your diagnosis**, and it may be best to not discuss your medications with anyone outside of your family of medical professionals.

TL;DR Keep your diagnosis and medication information **Private** it is business of anyone other than anyone that already knows about it already. On a side note, I really don't understand why technology is banned in some classes. If having technology is distracting for a student, then the student can choose for themselves not to use it. If it's distracting for the staff, then they need to work somewhere where technology is not in use. If they want to encourage verbal communication in the session, then that's a skill that the staff need to learn; I've been in just as many silent classes where the lecturer struggled to engage their audience where tech was banned as I have where tech was allowed. That’s low eh? I always say diverting meds is like peeing in the pool but worse because it’s a hydrotherapy pool. 😂 It's none of your business what people think of you!  Oh my rage would have sent me out of that room so fast. It's kinda weird that they're calling it a learning disability, we're perfectly capable of learning like anyone else, we're just terrible with paper and we're easily distracted..

Is ADHD actually considered a learning disability? So weird That was unthoughtful of the teacher, but it would have been obvious very quickly anyway.  You're making too big a deal of it.  You should go to the dean/ombudsman/student affairs now and report that professor. What an absolute bitch to do that to you and the other students.

&#x200B;

And most other students are going to forget soon about your accommodations soon anyway. I second this. My counselor says to immediately let them know if you have a problem like this. They can also make a note so that if it happens again the professor will get reprimanded.  I’m really nervous about owning up to it though, in high school a lot of my ap classmates resented me for getting extra accommodations and I was really hoping to avoid that with my fresh start in college. I know my adhd is apart of me but I don’t want to be perceived as different if that makes sense I turn the WiFi off and I have a privacy screen to make sure no one else is distracted by it. I have to take notes in a very particular way which is much easier to do on the fly with my laptop than it is to write it out. If my notes are at all messy I know I won’t read them so I try and be very through with them.  >Technology is a universal accommodation, screw her for taking it away from others. That’s shitty teaching at its finest.

I'm curious about this point you made. I've never heard of technology in the classroom described that way. 

Based solely on my experience, of course, 9 times out of 10 when I have an open laptops policy, the ones who bring them spend the hour on social media, YouTube, even (I shit you not) Steam. Aside from the pointlessness of them being there, they're a distraction to those around them. I want to accommodate people with disabilities for sure, but I need to know how to do that without opening the floodgates for tech abuses ruining my classroom. There has to be some way. this.

and since i didn’t see any one post it, this is in part so unexcusable because it’s pretty impossible to get a phd without learning the basics of student rights and nondisclosure etc. either the professor has some serious ableism issues or they are REALLY dense... While it is not tactful to say to all students "some students are allowed to use computers because they have learning disabilities," to my knowledge this is not an unlawful redisclosure of a disability. She didn't point to a particular student and say "for example, \[so-and-so\] has ADHD". It was just done in such an insensitive way that it seems like it should be illegal.  


Teachers in these situations are caught between a rock and a hard place. If they tell the class that they must request permission to use a laptop/recorder and may do so privately, they will have to deal with a multitude of individual requests at the beginning of each semester, each of which has an opportunity to devolve into a "that's not fair" argument. If they fail to announce it and rely on the syllabus, it would present an opportunity for a substantial disruption down the road when students failed to read the syllabus and half the class shows up with laptops. If they point out an obvious accommodation for a legitimate reason, which is not illegal, but certainly not sensitive, it can be extremely embarrassing to the student.  


Administration should deal with this by addressing it during training. To that end a complaint might help other students going forward. Someone’s professor is too much of a judgement all, ignorant douche to believe in ADD. I’m so sorry.  I agree with number one. There are rules in place. They’re not allowed to disclose that you have a disability. When I was a TA they were clear in the fact (and I always emphasized to students) that we as instructors can not disclose someone’s disability, we cannot ask the student what their disability is. The student can disclose it to the professor if they want but are not obligated to.  I agree. Absolutely no reason to say "because of learning disabilities." There are plenty of ways to phrase that without making anyone feel embarrassed. OP's professor is either clueless or just an asshole.  Well didn’t she blow some sunshine up your ass? Let me tell you something. I was the victim of a violent incident last year (100% caused by someone else) and people are trying to use my ADD diagnosis to blame me for what happened and deny me medical care for my resulting injuries. Just because a few people are compassionate doesn’t mean everyone is.   When I was in college, I kept a tight lid on it simply because I didn't want people constantly trying to buy (or, worse, steal) my medication. I had an entire month of meds stolen once, and it was a pain in the ass to get it replaced - doctor basically said he would only replace my meds once, so I needed to be more careful. After that, I didn't tell a soul about it, and kept my shit in a safe.  > This should be freaking obvious, though! As a first-year grad TA I had more sense than that...

I can totally see myself accidentally doing this.

"I ban electronics in my classroom"

*Oh wait... there's obviously going to be those people who will use them because of accomodations... I don't want people to think that I don't enforce my rules...*

"... except for those three people who have accommodations because of disabilities"

*Shit.  I should not have said that... should not have said that.* > But, I don't understand the whole no tech rule in the first place.

I get it.  Honestly, the vast majority of people do not use technology well and distract others.  Phones and laptops distract others.  Often people are far more likely to participate, etc. if technology isn't hindering it. There’s a study that showed students around a student who was misusing an electronic Device during class actually did even worse than the student who was off task.  So there is a very real reason to be concerned about using laptops and phones in class.

I know that I personally struggle if I’m sitting behind someone who’s watching YouTube or playing games on their laptop.

Most of my classes had a tech aisle where you could sit if you want to use a phone or laptop. Big Caveat- you can sit wherever you want if you’re using a laptop in tablet mode (ie: you have it flat or at a slight angle and are writing with a pen) So what?  You're there for you to learn and succeed, not to get the approval of people who are judgmental of your disability.  The people who judge you aren't worth your time - the rest will be impressed by your confidence in owning who you are. I’m not trying to minimize what you’re feeling, but honestly, if I was one of the other students, I would briefly note that some of the students got to use tech as an accommodation, then go back to freaking out about how much more work there is in college.  I’m sorry your high school classmates were assholes about your accommodations, but by the time high school ends, you’ve all been together for so long and everyone is up in everyone else’s business - college really is different.  
However, your professor needs to work on her understanding of confidentiality.  Not that ADHD is anything to be ashamed of, but it is private medical information.  She should have left it at “no tech without talking to me about it first”.   But the thing is, when you have ADHD, getting those accommodations ISN'T giving you an advantage over your classmates. It's leveling the playing field for you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot because your classmates are potentially ignorant.   


"Needing help isn't the same as not being able to do the work. If I were stupid I wouldn't be in these classes. You want all the crap I deal with by having ADHD, then you can have a laptop too."  


I think most people still think of ADHD as the hyper kid on the playground and have no clue what it's really like. People generally care a whole lot less in college.


You should mention something to the teacher, maybe even the school, depending on how that goes. That was way out of line. If you feel like you want to switch out of that class, telling this story to the registrar's office should get you out into any other class you want, even if it is already "full." Extra accommodations really aren't that dramatic. They make things tolerable not wasn't Actually, I think ADHDers work better together. Not that I have any proof, but we have a lot of overlap with shortcomings and strengths. One person's boredom is another's hyperfocus. So maybe next lecture, you three could sit together? Not that you all have ADHD, but you could secretly be best friends and don't know it yet ;) Wow nice! That is a great system. I wonder if i was diagnosed at Uni I could have done that. I used to try turn the wifi off, but within seconds I just turned it back on!

It would make it a lot easier to have a system of notes like you seem to [deleted] Are you a teaching at the college level? At some point you have to be responsible for your own learning. I took a class once where the syllabus said “if you’re going to do something distracting on your laptop, please sit in the back”

Laptops are so helpful for so many people, even at the high school level I have to make my classes interactive enough that students can’t be on their computers to do anything other than research or note taking. I bring an iPad for note taking. I always sit in the front row so the professor knows I'm not surfing the web and because sitting behind others distracts me. If I'm sitting behind someone, I start paying attention to what the people in front of me are doing instead of what the professor is doing.

&#x200B;

You could always add a policy to your syllabus that laptops are allowed, but if you catch someone doing something other than work the privilege will be revoked for the offending individual(s). You'll know when someone isn't doing school work on their laptop by those around them paying more attention to that person's laptop rather than your lecture. It's not hard to just say in private you need accommodations  That’s low eh? I always say diverting meds is like peeing in the pool but worse because it’s a hydrotherapy pool. 😂 Exactly! Your prof endangered you by putting your private medical information out there like that.  Well in high school it makes sense, but it makes less sense in college. I understand why they do it, but I feel like limiting students is not the best idea, even if it makes some people pay attention, it penalizes everyone else who could be benefitting My classes seem to have an unofficial one of those tech aisles - it's the line of seats nearest the wall, where there's power points :-P

Having said that, I usually watch my lectures online rather than go in in person, because I can speed it up and not get distracted by the five conversations going on in the seats around me :-/ It took a lot of trial and error to find something that works for me, I’m just lucky to have been diagnosed early enough that I had plenty of time to find a system that works for me :) Weirdly, I didn't notice this post was in ADHD, as I'm also a college instructor and subscribe to /r/Professors and /r/highereducation. I thought I was over there for a sec!

At my age, having a laptop to take notes definitely helps, but I've learned to manage my ADD (learning I had it at all was a big step!) If I were still 18, I can see it doing the opposite. When I was a young person in college, we didn't have anything like laptops or phones with all their distractions. I had to make do with doodling and staring out the window lost in thought. :D

I just want what will help my students the most, but often I find they don't really know what that is. They might *think* a laptop will help, but it will only help in the way another hit of smack will help a junkie get focused. 

I'm perfectly happy to work with anyone who goes through Disability Services, though. Haha, great way to look at it. It's even worse knowing that after being liberated from my desk I'm sure it was promptly snorted by some frat bro as a performance enhancing drug for a goddamn beer pong tournament.  Oh yeah - I feel like in college at a certain point, you just gotta say "you guys are adults, deal".

That being said, I did agree with some teachers that basically said that everyone with a laptop had to sit in the back half of class which I think is a really nice option. I think it might actually be a university wide policy. I try to grab a front row seat anyways. It’s easier for me to pay attention in the front of a lecture hall. The first few lectures that’s hard, but by the third week of class it’s usually half empty.
