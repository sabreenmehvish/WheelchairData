I love how productive I get when I'm avoiding a task I don't want to do The bathroom is clean, my bedroom is clean, sent Christmas snail mail to my best friend, packaged a return, did my laundry, labelled some boxes in my closet so that I stop forgetting what they are, now I'm on to the kitchen...


I'll get around to the other thing later... Last year instead of studying for my finals I repainted my room. For some reason my dumb ADHD brain decided that painting a wall was a lot more important than reading about cellular biology. i wish there was a way to hack this tendency!  Instead of cooking dinner I went out, bought a kettle, variety of teas, snacks and made a tea corner. Now Iâ€™m hungry and itâ€™s too late to get anything. I donâ€™t even like tea that much.. I deep cleaned and decluttered my entire apartment in a day. Still haven't read those articles for my finals tho.  "You know, this desk drawer needs some dusting and reorganizing..." Literally me last week when I didn't want to do something tedious at work.

This should be an ADHD joke. "How many people with ADHD does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They're off doing anything else so they don't have to." I know it to wellðŸ¤·, but to see the positive side of it: we CAN be productive! I wish my ADHD would turn to chores when I'm avoiding things. My brain just goes into overdrive thinking about anything and everything unrelated to what I'm avoiding, while I sit there staring blankly into the distance. Then nothing gets done at all This is why my house was so clean when I was in finals. I wish I could get other shit done when in not getting work done. I feel like I've wasted half of my life doing nothing.  2 years ago I binged every season of Itâ€™s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (I think it was 11 seasons back then) in about 2 weeks instead of studying for finals. ðŸ™Š Still did okay on the exams though.  Boy if this isnt my life lol I feel like this is me every day.  If I want to do it or at least understand what I need to do, I can get it done. If I hit a snag, cue to checking reddit/tumblr/all the social media and not doing the thing. I wish it were easier for me to recover from snags more easily.  I am good at tackling single step chores. The moment I try to turn my attention towards a task that requires the investment of time and muli-step planning I get anxious and procrastinate by doing small chores again.  But why do we do this??? What if we procrastinated about our procrastination to fool ourselves about what needs to be done.  OH YEAH

My Friday was me staring at a screen most of the day producing no code.

Today, Monday, during a meeting where a teammate was giving a presentation on the core parts of our business, I nearly finished my ticket.

It never fails. I once took apart my computer, cleaned it, and put it back together rather than studying  I do this at work so hard. I didn't want to sit outside my nice office with my bully of a coworker, so I've been sorta taking my time shipping orders, doing returns, working on the backlog of stuff that needs relisted... Anything so I can be alone in here and not working out in the warehouse.

On the bright side, my boss likes this. So.... Win win I guess? Did the painting turn out well? Cuz in that case it for sure was lolol It's called... being neurotypical ðŸ˜© Well, just one that has other important things to do (: I tend to clean everything else when I'm avoiding doing the dishes. I cleaned my bathroom sink, the toilet, took out the garbage. Dishes are still in the sink! Classic xD Because the ADHD brain is wired to be driven by interest and not by importance or priority like the neurotypical brain.  Because of you I edited my question here --> [https://www.reddit.com/r/mensa/comments/9ql4np/what\_are\_good\_jobs\_for\_gifted\_generalists/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mensa/comments/9ql4np/what_are_good_jobs_for_gifted_generalists/)
