Recently diagnosed ADHD: PI and on concerta...self-doubting ***Skip to the bottom for my question if you don't want to read me describing my ADHD***

&#x200B;

I've always done well in school, I have a 3.4 GPA in college rn.  However, I've always procrastinated.  I've always been easily sidetracked (supposed to be doing homework right now that's due tomorrow, but here I am on here instead), I've felt that whole 'read a page/paragraph but not actually read it/absorb what it said so you go back and read it over until you do' feeling, I talk loudly and over others and interrupt others (if I don't get out what I'm thinking now and wait my turn, I'm gonna forget what I was saying when they come back to me to say it), I'm impatient and hate waiting in line, waiting on time to pass, waiting for packages to arrive.  

I have road rage really bad because I have places to go dang it, why aren't you going faster? lol  and while I'm driving if I pass someone, I like to look back and see how far away they are to see how much better I'm doing since I passed them and then OOPS -- almost ran into that car in front of me because I was paying attention to the car that I passed.  I get lost a lot because I can't remember for the life of me where I came from (did I turn left or right here?  What street did we start on? I better pin my location on my phone so I can find my way back to my car later.   Another example is forgetting where I parked in a parking garage at college and looking up and down for like 30 minutes to find my car lol)

Everyone who goes out to eat with me already knows to tell the waiter/drive thru person "one moment please/yes we need more time for the menu" because I can't decide what I want.  I usually get \_\_, but what about trying \_\_ today?  What if I don't like it though?  I should probably just stick to what I normally get.  I want to look over the whole menu though in case there's something I want that i missed.

The reminders app on my iphone is my best friend.  "take pills - 7:50am" "take biotin - 8pm" "get mail after work - 6pm" "cat food, hair stuff, deodorant - 6:10pm" "set alarm early for tomorrow's meeting - 9pm" if i don't put something I need to do on there, chances are I'll forget, and then not do it until something sparks my memory/someone says something that reminds me that I need to make that reminder.  I'll go to my closet to pick out clothes to wear that day and I catch myself just standing there with a song in my head and then I'm like crap, I need to pick out clothes.  But did I wear this this week already? I can't remember...  I'll walk into a room when I get the idea that I have to do something, then once I get there I'm like "wait..why did I come in here?" go back to the first room, do something else, then remember what I was supposed to do in that other room in the first place.

I have anxiety pretty bad, everyone knows that.  I have depression I guess too.  I \*want\* to take my macbook with me to a coffee shop and get homework done, but that means i have to get out of bed. shower. do my makeup.  pick out clothes. pack my stuff for it.  drive 30 minutes....I'll just stay in bed.

My point is, I thought everything I did was normal.  I went in for a checkup on my 20mg of Fluoxetine and she asked about racing thoughts or something and I told her "Oh I always start a story and it branches to like 5 other stories and I forget what story I started with in the first place" and **she gave me a screener for ADHD.**  I scored a 3 (on a scale of 0-3) on most of the things on it, with the exception of the hyperactivity parts.  My boyfriend who was with me and helped me answer them was laughing with me at how ridiculously accurate the screener was.

My family physician has a specialization in obstetrics, however, she told me she has ADHD herself.  I have a good connection with her because I used to work with her kind of, so I'm worried that what if she diagnosed me ADHD as a like favor?

I'm on 27mg of generic Concerta (round little gray pill - no hole) and today is my 11th day.  All I've had is bad side effects.  Trouble falling asleep, loss of appetite/hunger (although it seems to be slightly better now), I had a higher heart rate most of the day the first couple days, my anxiety seems WORSE, and I almost feel more forgetful.  I have not felt more focus or concentration.  I'm worried it's not working because what if I really don't have ADHD?

**How long does it take for meds to work?  Is it normal/accurate to be diagnosed by a family physician? Please help as I'm struggling really bad with anxiety around this.**  

Can fluoxetine offset the effects of concerta? 

&#x200B; You should feel the Concerta’s positive effects within like a day or so of taking it the first time. I’d definitely call your doc and let them know.  And fluoxetine hasn’t had any negative interactions with Concerta for me so I’m not sure about that  It may just not be the right med or the right dose. Having side effects doesn't mean you don't have ADHD!

Let your doctor know it's not going well, and they can help you find something that works better. That's what I found on the internet so it makes me worried.  I told my doctor's assistant (who also coincidentally is on adderall for adhd) and she said "to give the meds time to work; it's not a miracle drug".  I have a one month check up appt for it but I'm impatient and want to feel better now /: Yeah I can't stop thinking about what if I don't have it and that's why it's not working.  Literally almost every spare minute I have this last week or so, I've been researching ADHD and googling everything under the sun about it. 

I have a one month check up for the generic concerta and I let her assistant (who works closely w her) that it's not working other than bad side effects and she said to give it time to work.  I mean I’m not gonna pretend to know more than someone who’s actually *in* the medical field but I’ve never heard anything about meds suddenly working after a month.  It was about 2 weeks until I felt any benefit from Adderal.  Stimulants don't need "time to work" like an antidepressant - they're either effective or they're not.

You may need a few days to adjust to the effects - the first few times I took Ritalin it felt bad, it wasn't until about the 3rd or 4th time that I started to appreciate the effects - but within a week you should be able to tell if a stimulant is working for you if it isn't. Try doing something you normally have trouble with -- reading for school, cleaning your home, etc. -- that's when you'll really notice if it's making a difference.

Concerta is a very strange extended-release med, because it's based on the idea that you build resistance to the effects of the med throughout the course of the day. So it gives you a low dose in the morning, and then a higher dose in the afternoon, [like this](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Pharmacokinetic-profiles-of-sustained-release-methylphenidate-and-newer-extended-release_fig4_9030063) (it's the line marked by triangles). For some people, this works really well. For me, that meant it didn't work in the morning, and gave me a racing heart and anxiety in the afternoon. I felt a lot better after switching to Ritalin LA with a lower overall dose.

There are also entirely different med classes out there - amphetamines, Strattera, Provigil - that you haven't been on yet. Not everyone responds well to any given family of meds, sometimes you have to try a few different kinds before you find the one that works for you.

I *hated* Adderall, and it's one of the most popular ADHD meds out there - doesn't mean I don't have ADHD, just that I don't respond well to Adderall.

If you think you have the symptoms of ADHD, your boyfriend thinks the ADHD screener was written to describe you, and a doctor who herself has ADHD also thinks you have the symptoms of ADHD... it's pretty darn likely that you have ADHD. A bad response to one medication doesn't change that. was it not generic?  I'm wondering if the fact that what I'm on is generic has any effect on whether it's working or not.  I didn't take it today and I feel no different.   Yeah I guess that's true.  I guess I'm just a skeptical person and ever since my diagnosis I've been like observing people more and noticing how they forget to do stuff sometimes and they butt into convos etc. and it makes me like wonder if everyone then is just like this?? But then all of my research on ADHD says that yeah, everyone has symptoms of it \*sometimes\*.  It's just when it affects your life.  

And my bank teller job I'm at right now, I literally got put on a 2 week probation period if you will after being there for less than 3 months because I couldn't remember how to do all the different functions.  I would listen and write stuff down on how to do them, I would genuinely want to remember them, but as soon as the moment came up for me to remember how to do it, it's like I couldn't remember or I only remembered partly.  So then I would ask someone to remind me/help me do it, and that led to everyone "baby-ing me when they shouldn't have to".  My written report literally screamed ADHD after i read it after being diagnosed.  

&#x200B;

I also previously wasn't able to work a 5a-1pm shift at one of my jobs because I was hours late to show up for it two times in one week because I just couldn't get myself to wake up that early, even if I gave myself 8+ hours to sleep.  

And obviously in my relationship, my boyfriend has to remind me to do things all the time and he gives me \*the look\* when I interrupt him when he's talking, or he knows that if I'm reading something and he's speaking to me, I can't do both at one time.  I have to either be focused on reading, or focused on talking to him.  

&#x200B;

I guess I'm just in denial maybe?  And I feel like no one believes me at work when I told them and they think I"m just making excuses for being forgetful.  I just feel alone in this world with this I guess.  So I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about this. <3 Yes, it’s generic. I would imagine the effects of brand name Adderall are similar/identical to generic. 

I think what you are going through is completely normal. I don’t see anything wrong with your primary doc diagnosing and prescribing. If you want to confirm diagnosis, maybe speak to a psychiatrist? I just wondered because I've read from a lot of places that the FDA was trying to ban some certain generic Concerta because it was proven that it didn't meet the level requirements of being as effective as the name-brand one.  People said if it didn't have the hole on the back, it probably is that one generic that doesn't work.  Coincidentally, I have one with no hole.  

I've looked into and called a lot of places asking how much it would cost to be evaluated for ADHD and most said it would cost $200+ and I can't afford to just throw that money out.  And I'm anxious because what if I do pay that much and they just say "yeah you have ADHD" so it's like great.  I spent all that money for no reason then.  Or if they say I don't have it, then it's like well great I've been taking methylphendiate for no reason.
