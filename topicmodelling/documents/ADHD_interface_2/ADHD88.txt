Do you find it hard to concentrate reading from a screen but is fine with hard copies? I need to read large amount of wordy documents on a daily basis and it is impossible to print out everything. I’m pretty sure a lot of people are in the same situation. How do you cope with this problem?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the great inputs!! I prefer on screen reading but hate reading in general.

Reading out loud helps if it's an option. Sometimes I try to cope with this by printing out all of the articles and other things I needed to read for classwork. It can get expensive but It's still less expensive than me failing my classes. Having a dedicated device (whether a physical book or an e-reader) is helpful for most anyone when it comes to focusing on reading. The less opportunity we have to context-switch, the better, and doubly so for those of us with ADHD! I don't think this is necessarily and ADHD issue, lots of people don't like reading from a screen (but it might of course be worse for our weird brains). Haven't really found a one fits all solution, but how about using a big font? I found that adjusting the font size on my kindle helped quite a bit because bigger letters don't put as much strain on your eyes. It's a bit weird, having maybe 15 lines of text on a 'page', but you get used to it. For leisure reading, I'm fine with my Kindle.   For work or grad school I prefer hard copies of reference books and textbooks (although I also buy the PDF version of references so that I have easy searches).    Journal articles or technical white papers have to be printed out so that I can highlight, circle, and double back to re-read.   Do you have a tablet? it might help you some to bring the screen down to the same position you are used to reading paper.

There's some serious trail and error involved here, but you can see if any of the 'big' apps make reading on a tablet easier for you. 

For example 


Playbooks, the google product, mimics the lifting of the page as you turn the page

Kindle, the amazon product, slides the pages across the screen without any distortion.


I'm sure there are other e-reader apps out there but I really really like the google product.  depends on what it distracting you while you are doing screen reading.

If it is general eye flicker, I've opened up MS paint and created "masks" of black, and saved these (as .jpg) in various sizes to block out other parts of a page.

If it is notifications I can silence, or mute these. If I can't, I can uninstall the application. you may not have this option depending on work policies.

If it is the format i.e. background colour, of font colour, perhaps you can copy and paste portions (or the whole document) into a program that will let you change these colours, and go from this app.

Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.
 I bought the reMarkable device. It’s pricey but it really helps since it is more like paper and also you can’t do anything but read and annotate so it helps with distractions!  While my answer is that I prefer to read from paper, it isn't because it is easier to read it is because I remember better when I highlight and take notes. This works better on paper. I also remember using - primarily - method of loci, and changing font sizes in the digital realm almost completely destroy that method of memory. I got a kindle (regular, not tablet, the cheapest one) in grad school largely for reading PDFs of journal articles and it was so worth it. I think for me it's not about the screen itself so much as the fact that any time I'm on my computer/tablet I have the option of opening a browser window and doing something more fun. It's way easier to concentrate on the kindle where the only alternative I have is just to read a different book.

If the documents are PDF or can be converted to PDF, they can be read on a kindle like a book. I've found flux on low settings solves that one for me. Making the screen slightly off white works wonders for me. Same! I get really bad brain fog after looking at a screen for even a while. Lowering the brightness helps me, since my eyes are *really* sensitive to high brightness. Flux helps a ton too. For reading web pages with a lot of text, BeeLine reader makes it sooo much easier.  Look into getting tested for Irlen Syndrome. Changed my life. I prefer reading on a screen because I can highlight stuff to focus on where I am in the page. Reading hard copies is harder personally. Can't highlight my textbooks and the print can be so tiny. I can just enlarge it on my computer. During my University years while studying from an ebook I discovered that if I print out all of the relevant pages and go through them with a set of highlighters ([I use these](https://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Zensation-Mildliner-Highlighter-Assorted/dp/B07CFH365Z/)) I retain the information surprisingly well.

I’ve found that the above works great for studying and research purposes, especially when the original source is digital. As of late I’ve been reading through a bunch of legal documents for future court testimony and this strategy has been an absolute lifesaver. While the original documents were sent to me via PDF I just can’t seem to concentrate very well reading it directly from my PC screen.

When it comes to reading for leisure however I find that my iPad works just fine. Paper books and e-readers have always been hit or miss for me. I had this problem. My first year in grad school I was in an office that had free printing, so I was able to print everything. My following year I did not have access to free printing and really struggled. My biggest issue is not actually reading the text and getting distracted by whatever peaks interest in the beginning. 

I found that if I am able to interact with the pdf, then I’m more likely to finish reading it. Reading thousands of journal articles is exhausting and overwhelming. Identifying what you’re trying to get from the literature/text can make a world of difference. For example while writing a paper I would create folders (intro, argument #1, argument #2, etc)  then I would download the pdf. Then while reading I would use the highlight text tool and sticky note tool to either synthesis the paragraphs or write a few sentences about how I could use it in my paper. Then I would rename the pdf, “titleofarticleuseforintropar2.pdf” stick it in the corresponding folder and move on to the next. 


I found that organization really helps my adhd.    Before I struggled with completing projects/ tasks and would get too overwhelmed to start. So by breaking things down into smaller tasks, I’m able to complete the large task. It’s really tedious sometimes, but it’s been extremely helpful. Yes. I really dislike screen reading. 

I've identified that one of my main problems with screen reading is that I can't interact as much with the document. I like to highlight, underline, annotate. I do this on PDF viewers as well, which has made it a little more bearable, but I much prefer hard copies, and the physical act of switching pens and highlighters and turning pages. I feel more connected to the material.

Because I, too, couldn't print out all of the reading I needed to do (mostly for college classes), I instead downloaded a **screen reading app.** I would listen to the text read out loud and do something else to keep my hands occupied--color, knit, play 2048, whatever. I once spent nine nearly-uninterrupted hours reading a blog this way. 

Of course, there is the drawback that robotic voices can be distracting in the fact that their cadence and tone is inorganic, but they're improving all the time. The screen reading app I downloaded does a relatively good job of imitating human speech ([here](https://ttsreader.com/), if you're interested). There's a bunch of different voices to listen to, and you can adjust the speed to your liking.

Of course, you can't highlight or screen-read photocopies at all--in which case I'd bite the bullet and just print it out. 

Hope this helps! For me it’s actually the exact opposite.  Same problem. I luckily had a professor that would specially print things out for me, but in most cases I would just have to read off a screen. I realise my issue isn’t that I can’t read off a screen, but a hard copy allows me to do things like underline and highlight. It’s not that those things help me understand the readings, but the act of keeping busy with my hands helps me stay focused. Another professor advised me to keep busy, stay active while finishing lengthy readings. So to stay focused with a screen, I’ll take notes on paper, even if I’ll never look at them again. Or alternate between standing and sitting.  I am not sure if i find it easier because it is in a hard copy per se, but I do much prefer it.

For me I think that with a hard copy, especially if it is something I have to make notes on, there is not as much opportunity for distraction. Right now I am supposed to be reviewing a document emailed to me, I have ended up on here... If I were on paper this wouldnt happen! yeah, definitely! but I think I'm dyslexic too so I'm sure that's a pretty big part of it.

Its so much easier to read plus I like having a psychical copy to highlight and take bites in the margins. and it's easier when I can see/feel how much reading I have left. it always feels so overwhelming on computers when I just have page numbers to go off of ahh!  Do you use the speech or narrate option on computer if you have that ? I use that a lot when I’m incapable of actually reading. I find I take it in better to hear it sometimes.  I'm the complete opposite.   I think I’m the opposite. I get lost and distracted with my thoughts on paper, but not on a screen. Probably because if I’m using my phone/laptop to read I’m also listening to calming music to help me focus. I get more distracted by my phone because of texts and emails and notifications but less distracted by my computer since I usually have notifications off, so if I really need to focus I use my computer. To each their own! Yes, Why? I always opt for in class college courses, because of books, white boards, etc.. 
I took an English course where the professor wanted us to read a lot from this one website and also submit all papers electronically via the college website. I don't have the focus to do that without literally getting a headache.

I dropped that course on day three and got a full refund. Yes!    Yes. I need to have them in front of me, like a book. Even a tablet is better than a computer. This semester, two of my grad classes have all online books, that cannot be printed in any form (I think as a copyright prevention) and it is TERRIBLE for me. Like someone else said, idk if it's a specific ADHD thing, but I know for someone who LOVES reading but can only do it in certain settings and scenarios without losing focus, the on screen reading makes things so difficult.  Yes!!  I thought it was just me and getting old.   Nah. I just can't concentrate neither of these.. i’m the opposite. i love reading on a screen and can read for hours. can’t read a book for more than 5 min without getting bored  I'm exactly the same. If I have to read something really long I *have* to print it out. Finally sucked it up & admitted I needed a printer because of that (except I already have one just none of the cables - oops).

RIP me. I really miss having lots of "free" printing from when I was a student. I agree, hard copies are so much easier as I don't switch tabs all the time. Alternatively, I've been reading books like I read Reddit. Whenever I have a little break/sitting around doing nothing.

  


It takes a bit of effort (uninstall Reddit and put the ebook reader in the Reddit apps place)

  


Once I got used to it it got amazing. I read a book in like two weeks which is personally satisfying.

  


This way, I always have a book in my pocket. I have an AMOLED phone which is quite comfortable to read on. Seconded. If it's an iPad or other tablet, no apps that are not required for study and no notifications should be enabled. I found using white words on black screen with diminished screen brightness bearable. Still significantly worse than reading on paper though. > I don't think this is necessarily and ADHD issue

I can confirm, this problem is associated to being a human in general. 

> Haven't really found a one fits all solution, but how about using a big font?

**This!** *I am a web designer, so I have a decent amount of experience in typography.* There is actual math that goes into figuring out the perfect font to use, but a good rule of thumb is, use 15 - 16 size font for optimal reading on screen devices. Also, another one of my tips is to figure out what contrasts you like the best. On paper, it’s white(ish) background and black font. On screen I always use black background and white text, this is commonly known as, “Dark Mode”. 

Switch your colors and font size, and then test out a paragraph to see how you like it, keep adjusting until you find the right combination of settings that you like! 

***I hope this helped!*** :)
 
Thanks for the input. I agree other folks have similar issues but I’m more interested in how people with ADHD could deal with the issue as the solution would more likely work for me as well. 

I use larger fonts too, but it gets awkward when it’s on those pdf that doesn’t resize to fit around the screen. It stops me from getting into a flow for reading when I have to drag the document left and right constantly. It's true, there are studies about how much people absorb reading from a screen vs. reading from a physical page. But I agree that ADHD can exacerbate it! The kindle is the closet thing to a book imo, I find it much easier to read on vs my phone or tablet 

Ive actually gotten back into reading because of my kindle, best gift ever.  I have the kindle! Tho I found it a bit inconvenient to import documents and that it does not support pdf very well. I’ve heard things about method of loci. So you can remember on which part of a particular page a particular info is? Does it work that way?

About highlighting its same for me. I got myself a drawing trackpad and highlight on PDFs with the track pen. It feels kinda close to highlighting on real notes! How does the Kindle handle the PDF's text? When I did this with the first gen of Kindle's it was horrible. I bought my kindle for the same purpose but I eventually gave up importing pdf because pdf doesn’t work very well on kindle and the file sorting system on kindle gives me headache. As a regular pdf reader, you have any tips on this? Thank you! My eyes is awfully sensitive to brightness as well! If the screen is too bright, brain fog; if the room headlight is too bright, brain fog. Darn it eyes lol. Thanks man I’ll give it a try. I did the self diagnostic test and decided to do a quick experiment of adding  one of those colored-transparent plastic sheet onto my screen. It is a quick fix! Would you say it is still worth it to get tested by the professional tho?  I do this too, I just highlight the words with mouse as I read and it helps me a lot.  Thank you! In fact I’m also writing a paper and you answered my un-asked question! This is a total plesent surprise! It was one of my major headache to navigate all the papers I’ve collected and read. Currently I keep a daily research journal to put all the notes.  I will try out your suggested method! Unrelated but do you find it helpful when people correct/point out your misspellings or does it just annoy/upset you? Yea! I’m so thankful that the function exists. I can not afford to use it all the time though as my overall reading speed would be too slow to cover everything  Sir you are the blessed ones in the age of technology. I've tried this before, but I did read some research that and read that black on white is better for eyes. idk how true it is...time for more research This sounds super legitimate lol thanks man I’ll give it a try. Correct... where on the page and the visual layout of the page makes a big difference (where headings are, pictures are, etc). If you find the standard filter works then yeah, I definitely would. My glasses have seven spectral filter layers as my prescription. Seven!

This is one of those things I wish my parents knew about when I was a child as it's made that much of a difference for me.  I can say I find it annoying when people do this to others. People who do this are jerkwads. And I am speaking as an ex-English language instructor. Unless someone has asked the other person to proofread for them, others should keep their mouths shut unless they literally don't understand what the person has written... which is never the case.  Same here it’s a shame they haven’t invented brain to brain download yet because that would save sooo much time  Not a sir but thanks lol I also prefer screens and tech over paper and books because it’s less waste and takes up less space. I would rather stare at a screen for hours than waste a bunch of paper printing shit out. Plus I love the conveniences of being able to highlight, write notes, search my highlights and notes and read on the go. It’s been a lifesaver for grad school. I have no excuse to not do my readings since I can access them anywhere, anytime. Lots of my classmates use the excuse that they don’t always carry their books around so they don’t read. So for me it’s been awesome. I’m also a millennial though so I’ve been using tech for school for many years now.  I think people should be more educated about dyslexia. I once had a teacher who is a suspected dyslectic. He would pronounce one particular name incorrectly and consistently throughout the whole course. But when we asked him to clarify the spelling, he is able to give the correct spelling and looked unbelievable that we had to ask. The teacher was laughed at by students for the entire school year and when one guy raise the possibility that he might be dyslexic, people just dismiss it and continue to joke about said teacher.  Reminds me of the [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). Essentially, when I do something that is potentially stupid or rude, it's clearly because of an outside factor. When someone else does it, it is because they are stupid or rude.  Which I think is also linked to the [above average bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority), where everyone you ask is a better than average driver, a bit smarter than average, more empathetic, etc.  Of course, not everyone can be above average.

I imagine every single one of those students has a word that they pronounce just as badly but are unaware of their own errors.
