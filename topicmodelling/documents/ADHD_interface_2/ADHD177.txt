Sometimes life overwhelms me And I feel like I just can’t do it. And I just want to curl up under my duvet and forget about the world and everyone in it. Get lost in another world by watching a film/tv show.  
  
And I also think that other people just wouldn’t understand. They couldn’t understand. Unless you’ve got ADHD you can’t know.  
  
I’m not depressed, I’m just...overwhelmed.
  
Sorry for the downer. I’ll be OK in the morning. me_irl Reading this while in the fetal position I totally understand ♥  relate to this so much...some days are just better than others. Definitely good to remember, it'll get better and you're ok. I just feel enormous pressure in my head. I feel so overwhelmed and worked out, even though I don't do anything at all. Sometimes even my vision gets blurry due to the pressure in my head. Life's a total blur for me, cause I can't focus on present, millions of thoughts, going at million miles per hour inside my brain, actually just tunes me out from the reality. I'm 29, I don't have a single happy memory, cause I've never expweiwnxed any. Cause I can't experience anything at all. It's just all mixed up and blended together. Tangled in my own web of thoughts.  reading this while under my blankets hiding from the real world.... r/me_irl Hey, me too. In my fetal position. Just stopping myself from exploding into rhosuands of pieces.
