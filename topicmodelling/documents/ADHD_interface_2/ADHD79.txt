How can a reading assignment be best structured for the ADHD brain to absorb all the information? I am doing a final report in one of my courses on ADHD, the affects of stimulant medications, and exploring ways we can improve the process of choosing the most effective stimulant for an individual.


I have a lot of free range, and would love to structure the paper in such a way that it’s “ADHD-brain friendly”.  


Ideas I have so far is working with spacing, making sure it’s not too “busy” since that’s can be distracting, and playing with the idea of having a summary paragraph at the end of every major topic I touch.


**Fellow ADHD brains, what sort of things in a reading (organizationally/structure-wise) help you stay focused and absorb the material?** Prior and continued engagement is key - make it relatebale if possible. If not it's a good idea to do a good job at presenting the topic as normal. I know once I have an overarching understanding (images in my head for me) it's easier.  

Also I don't know if this is helpful but for me it's more how I engage. I have to have my highlighter and pencil.  

Sounds like you're on the right track with having clear sections. This is mostly from personal experience and extremely limited experience working with adolescents. Great topic sentences as the first sentence of each paragraph as much as possible would be ideal. If you can sum up the general idea of each paragraph in the topic sentence of that paragraph it would make it easier to skin.

The summary after each major topic sounds good as well.
