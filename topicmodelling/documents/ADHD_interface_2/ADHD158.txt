Reading for education OK I have finally accepted I have ADHD ring of fire. So that focuses on emotions  mainly as have had great support to get this far in life.  Went with the lovely social support  person today and she suggested the library. I got a Dr Russell Barkley book today and I am laughing and crying at the same time it's making so much  sense now as I have been in a bit of denial about it due to family perceptions but now  I have qualified for disability funding for extra support it has hit me like a brick wall. 

Tl Dr if you need some help and information try Dr Barkley's book s YouTube's or podcasts.
