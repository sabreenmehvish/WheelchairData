Tips for online timed reading quiz Hey squad. I have to take a reading quiz online today, and I am extremely nervous. I read the chapters, but I can’t retain the information to save my life! I take notes, and it helps, but I’m still scared I’m not going to remember anything when the quiz starts (it’s timed.) Does anyone have any tips?? I took my medication today (20mg adderall) it works wonderfully with keeping focused, but I need extra help to retain the information. If you guys have any tips, please please please comment them below!  If this is for college, I recommend looking into disability services for getting extended test time. The school should have guidelines on their site or you can contact them to find out what you need to register. It might not help you for this test, but in the long run, it will probably be super beneficial. Thank you !!!
