I compulsively google everything Both on and off meds. Whenever there’s a question, or something I want to talk about but can’t remember a lot of info about, or something I want to fact check, or basically any information I don’t know about or am interested in I HAVE to google it. I will derail entire conversations with zero consideration to other people, and it’s extremely difficult to suppress the urge. To the point where I interrupted an interview once to google some random topic that I wanted to discuss. And then of course I am glued to my phone/laptop for 5-10 minutes opening tabs left and right and sharing random snippets that no one understands because i give no context.

I kinda love it, and I kinda wish that normal people did it too because why wouldn’t you? Also I wish normal ppl would stop relating to this when I describe this to them bc they definitely DON’T understand that it’s a compulsion and not some “haha so quirky and nerdy” thing.

EDIT/UPDATE: Wow! I had no idea this would be so relatable, ya freakin dorks! Thanks for the gold, anonymous fairy godmother.

To clarify the last paragraph, this is def something that people without ADHD do, but I was more talking about it in the context of hyperfocus and being unable to resist going down the rabbit hole. That’s why I posted this on r/ADHD. I do this. It annoys my gf so much. I've never understood how people can *not* want to Google everything they don't know. I don't wanna be the kinda person who can think "I wonder if pigs have eyelashes..." and then not find out. It's why I'm a dilettante in every field. I wouldn't choose to be any other way. So one night the thought popped into my head while playing Hitman.

“I wonder if the Mormons has Hitman back in the day”

I spent five hours reading up on the history of the Mormon church

I’m not Mormon. I don’t even believe in God.

But I know so much about the Mormon church now. I once googled for a video of a horse pooping to find out what happens to their tail. I wanted to know if they poop on their tails or swish it from side to side.  


It was a disgusting video. Their tails lift up, and you can visually see the butthole open wide.  


Terrible video to have been watching at the dinner table but... I needed to know.. It's so frustrating when driving and I can't google things!! It's a form of anxiety more or less for me. Like I have to know everything so people won't think of me like I'm dumb. Which is totally never happening. So I know all this stupid shit no one cares about, and stuff that should get me further in life I basically ignore. I can relate to an extent. I won't derail interviews to google something but I'll certainly derail conversations. Yes this is me. When i'm on meds this habit is 10 times more effective i read so fucking much.  Omg I do this. I have like 150 tabs open that consist of questions and information. If you value your relationships and potential advancement opportunities, I’d come up with a strategy for delaying when you google something. My first thought would be to politely say “do you mind if I write a note to myself real quick?” And then write the note about the thing you wanna google. That way you won’t forget it and you’ll get your chance to look it up at a more appropriate time. 

I wish people liked it too though, man. I get it. :) I have the rule to only google things when

a) the group I'm part of is trying to make a decision and we need further information to do so, or I personally need further info to make up my mind 

b) the group has been discussing a controversial topic and I get bored with listening to educated guesses and feel like people actually start to quarrel about a question that can be answered with factual information

Otherwise I try not to google in groups because I feel that it's impolite to concentrate on the device instead of the other people. Giraffes communicate vocally, but the pitch is too low in adult giraffes for humans to hear it. Giraffes probably talk about us and we can't even hear them.

I wouldn't know that if I hadn't impulse-Googled it. What did our people do before the Internet? lol is this connected with adnd... never thought it. You’re not alone. This has become a serious problem for me as well. It’s gotten to the point where not only do compulsively google every one of those random thoughts, but i’ll open up safari when i don’t even have anything to search for yet. I’ll literally just sit there staring at the blinking cursor until i come up with something. 

This shit is getting way out of hand. Phone shows i’ve spent over 33 hours on safari in the last 10 days alone. Plz send help. > Both on and off meds. Whenever there’s a question, or something I want to talk about but can’t remember a lot of info about, or something I want to fact check, or basically any information I don’t know about or am interested in I HAVE to google it.

Not a unique ADHD trait but rather common and neurotypical, in fact:

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-addicted-to-inform/ relate so hard I have ADHD. I relate. I constantly ask Google everything. My favorite is whatever existential question of the day I have. Or I'll notice I have a scab and wonder how scabs are formed and look that up etc etc.  I do this too. I can get lost in a google black hole for literally hours just reading about things I find interesting. 

If only I could take that focus and level of engagement and apply it to my job... God, this is so me. I like hanging around non-ADHD people ofc, but sometimes I need to spend time with my friends who are ADHD too, so that we can all google shit together and be equally interested in the information. A friend of mine and I once spent four hours googling together, just random topics and whatnot, and it was so much funnnn. I do this, but I'm trying to stop. I'm writing this out more to concretize my own advice-to-myself, so feel free to ignore it. 

It's a bad habit. Conversations are social time, not info time. Research when you're alone, report when you're with others--and if you don't know something, either fess up and move on or make up something plausible and move on. White lies about insignificant crap is fine. I've actually held up small-talk interactions with strangers for an unacceptable amount of time trying to accurately assess how my day is actually going rather than just, y'know, saying "Fine, how are you?" I'm the worst about remembering weather reports. I'm trying to get into the habit of just blurting out something that sounds reasonable, because--this is key--**social interactions are not about relaying data**. 

We are not computers. People don't even really listen to your words, they just want you to act like they expect a normal person to act--or if you act in an unexpected way, they want you to do it pleasantly. People want to be made comfortable and validated. It's more about the undercurrents, the status checks, power hierarchies, in-/out-group stuff--all the crap you'd see chimps doing without words--than about the meaning of the words, which are almost universally forgotten if not ignored in the first place. Concern yourself with semantics and accurate information when you're putting things in writing, not when speaking face to face. (Obvs. there are exceptions to this.)

Remember: *being wrong is fine*. This is a hard one for me, so I've been trying to be wrong on purpose just for exposure and acclimation to that discomfort. It's not a test. Nobody's going to stop being your friend if you're wrong about which actor was in what movie or whatever. It's extremely unlikely that anyone will know the correct answer *and also have the confidence to contradict you*. Nothing bad will happen, even if someone does contradict you. Even if someone calls you out on it with absolute surety, you just shrug and say "Oh, huh, guess I was wrong" and life goes on. **It's okay to be wrong.**

**It is more important to connect *with* people as people through interactions than to convey accurate information *to* people, because you are a human and not a computer, so leave your computer in your pocket.** Yes this is me. When i'm on meds this habit is 10 times more effective i read so fucking much.  Browsing reddit, sees something, Googles as has to know more, comes back to Reddit sees this post, cracks up laughing. Write it down in a physical notebook and Google it later. Work on meditation or even just sitting there enjoying the breeze, people watching in a park (your phone is away), so you can practice being comfortable not reaching for it. Practice not using it to fill up tiny moments of empty space.

It might help. In other ways too.  I don't do this in conversation, but part of the reason why I waste so much time on the internet is because I google every random thought that comes into my head :( I do this too...sometimes to my own annoyance! Relatable and I do this all day long. I do this too! Even when people are having conversations around me. I feel like a creep, but they mention something and I just need to know! I do this ALL the time, it's nice to have some useful knowledge in my brain. When I'm with my SO, and either of us has a question about something (i.e. *why can't people lick their elbow easily?)* he instantly says "you're going to google this right now aren't you?" and in the midst of that sentence I usually have my phone unlocked and on Safari already! 

I’m also a psychology undergrad so my googling skills really help when I’m researching! The only thing that is a problem is that I can’t filter out all the irrelevant research and sometimes my mind goes off on a tangent (even in the psychology field).  Whenever I get interested in a subject I constantly google it and learn as much as I can about it. I obsess about it until I feel fulfilled with knowledge enough to practically be an expert. Ask me about quantum mechanics LOL Before I started taking Vyvanse , my phone would be almost dead by noon from impulsively googling every single question that popped in my head. People think of me as a know-it-all. Now that it is quiet in my head ,I feel at peace. I don’t really need to know about the etymology of the word dilettante  which I read up above. This is my life, but I'm an academic, and so it's totally okay.

The same thing applied to when I went to several conferences outside of my field. People were confused as to why I was going to a chemistry conference.

While a few of the things were somewhat relevant to my work, on the intersection between physics and chemistry, I was just interested. And it was interesting. Before that point, I had absolutely no idea about high energy chemistry (read: stuff that explodes) and it is now one of my favourite subjects to talk about. I do this a lot too  One time I Googled where ponies came from. I needed to know about tiny horses!!! I do this a lot. Quite often it's because I've forgotten the meaning of a word and want to make sure I'm using it correctly.

So a lot of my Google history is just "define: <normal word>" I do the same thing when I’m chatting with my grandma over breakfast or lunch (we both live with my parents, and I’m unemployed), or when we’re out walking in our neighborhood. In contexts like this, the information becomes a contribution to the conversation, which I *think* Granny appreciates. Not sure how she feels.

Did you know that the earliest known reference to French toast, which the French call *pain perdu*, dates back to the fourth or fifth century? Also, the American robin is not actually closely related to the European robin. This is 100% me, and its super bad at bed time because why not Google all those going to sleep "shower thoughts" I've been taking personal action to not do it at night, to try to remember to do it later (which I ultimately forget) but it helps give me back some control over the compulsion, even later on during the day. <3  Y’all are truly my people. The other day I thought to myself, “You’ve heard of the Nuremberg trails but how much do you really know about them?” Cut to me researching the Nuremberg trials for an hour. I wish I had that much zest while grading papers. Holy shit I do this all. the. time.

I'll be taking to someone and suddenly pull my phone out to look up more information about whatever we're taking about. I have this magical little computer in my pocket with access to more information than I could possibly ever comprehend, why wouldn't I take advantage of that?

What I don't get is when people shame me for it. Sometimes I'll be arguing with my dad and I'll think of an example to back my side up, so I Google it to make sure I've remembered it correctly and I have all the facts. He tells me I shouldn't be supporting something if I don't know enough to the point where I have to Google it, which I think is ridiculous.

I also started bookmarking all of the weird shit I Google, because half the time I'll think of something I looked up before and can't remember exactly what it was. That bookmarks folder is HUGE. Oh yes. I get derailed for hours reading about something  I've never associated this with ADHD but I do the same thing. If there was one thing I could bestow upon people it would be a very inquisitive and thorough mind. I've always had a hard time understanding how this is not the norm.  I do this too, but I wish I didn’t. I pick up my tablet to compulsively google and lose 45 minutes to fooling around online. Same. Internet was worst/best thing that happened to me.  i do this too. you are not alone.  This is so me, I compulsively google until I had to enter captcha because google thought I was DDOSing its server. My brother and I will get into a conversation, start bringing up new things we learned, start googling and sharing information with each other. Then we will go down the rabbit hole and wind up so far away from the topic we wind up looking up how sarin gas and VX is made and how they work. Always thought that if our search history was taken out of context, it might be mistaken for malicious intent. Is anyone else's hobby/obsession Wikipedia deep diving? Yesterday I went down a Monoglian history hole 😂 Me too! And IMDB, I can’t get through a single show/movie without filling reading up about the show and actors in it.  +1 for me too. ;)

I've learned to keep it to myself, because I noticed that most of the people that I'm with at that point really don't care. But that doesn't mean I don't want to learn myself.  Google has replaced conversation for me.  People give me too much anxiety and Google doesn't judge you but it will give you ads for shit you didn't know you wanted yet.  Thank you google. Gamify it! If you're in a group and somethin comes up that you're trying to figure out, make it  an activity! "Who was that actor in Breaking Bad?" becomes "wasn't he also in Malcolm in the Middle?" and someone coming back with, "That's the same guy? No way." until you say, "Yes way, wanna bet?" and before you know it, you've won a steak dinner. Thanks Bryan Cranston.  I ask every one before I google something, then I google it, even if they answer me. I google the same thing over and over, though😅 does anyone else have about 500 tabs open  DUDE SAME  I don't understand how anyone doesn't utilize such a vast source of information. If I hear about anything I don't know about, I google it, always! I have gotten much better at typing in the search and then coming back to it after the conversation is over though. Same. It ruins my relationships that my husband because he seems t as me just having to prove him wrong. Even when he is right I Google!  I do this too...sometimes to my own annoyance! [deleted] I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/mbti] [Any XNXPs do this too?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9u1tio/any_xnxps_do_this_too/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* I DO THIS WITH MY BF IS IT AN ADHD THING?!?

Undiagnosed, appt in January for highly likely inattentive adhd diagnosis. No idea why I do this but I also impulsively google everything This is me. I stop series that I watch with my wife just for google something they said, I CANT KEEP WATCHING THE WHOLE THING WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IS SUBOXONE?! (Mr. Robot recently). And then we talk about what we've found about that thing, and yes... the 40 min episode could last 2 hours.   


Then when I'm just thinking about something or I have something stuck on my head, I spend HOURS opening hundreds of tabs, reading all kind of information about the same thing... To the point I'm able to discuss to my  Psychiatrist. It's kinda impulsive/obsessive some times, I can't leave or stop googling things sometimes, and spent hours and hours. With meds this could still happen, but then I force to myself to go back and do what I have to do. Are you INTP personality type? i do this with spelling all the time

edit: i had to check the word spelling for this comment Definitely, but I think this tendency was healthier before Wikipedia, as it led to more thinking and then researching, and not mindlessly "Google n' forget".  I'd never even connected this with ADHD! I have inattentive, but I've never thought about the way things BUG me if I don't know the answer to the point I will pull out my phone in the middle of a conversation even if I know I shouldn't, just to figure it out! 
I've never really noticed others doing it much, aside from my mum (who low-key might have ADHD inattentive? Hard to say, she has a lot of the social and personal habits I have which are also symptoms of ADHD inattentive, but also has never really discussed if she had other symptoms and problems like in uni like I've had. She also very possibly just doesn't know better.) 
Imo, this isn't something people without ADHD can't have, but I do see where it correlates really hard with impulsivity and poor impulse control in social interactions, esp to the point of being detrimental.  Ughhh now I have to google that ... do they?  I feel exactly the same way. My family gets soooo annoyed with me when we’re talking and I need to a fact check or further learn about something. How can you not want to learn something when it’s just so easy to do so now. I want to know everything. Not so I can be annoying but because I’m genuinely curious and have a love of learning. Most people just don’t care about knowledge. It’s so infuriating. Because we have an imagination lol My GF does it and it breaks my heart. She looks up things while we’re hanging out with friends, and will bring the conversation back to where it was 5 minutes ago to announce what she’s learned- most people have moved on and only listen politely. She will look up plant/animal species while we are on a hike, face buried in her phone, ignoring the rest of the scenery. She will attempt to look things up while driving (until I beg her to stop).  
It’s not that I don’t want to know the things she’s looking up- we both have ADHD and a thirst for knowledge. But she would rather take attention away from her current environment to pursue that knowledge. It shows a lack of desire to engage with those around her at best, and is genuinely dangerous at worst.   
It breaks my heart because it feels like she can’t just enjoy living without interrupting it to learn [objectively useless] facts. I just want to spend time with her and leave some of life to wonder, to soak up life as it comes and goes so quickly. But- she’s on her phone.  
Please, for those around you- please know how you affect them.  Yes my gf does this and it annoys me. I'm the one with ADHD though.  Master of None Ooh, good word! Raised Mormon, here to confirm that they totally did lol I accidentally joined the church after meeting missionaries randomly one day. Got way too involved, ended up getting baptized. (I have no idea why, just my dumbass thinking it was a good idea.) Had to leave the church eventually because tithing is hell and it got a little too weird for my taste. I'm not religious, never been religious, but for like half a year was going to church every Sunday and going out with missionaries at least twice a week. Good times, really nice people, but I definitely wouldn't do it again. Also the no coffee thing was kinda a bummer. Has Hitman? Do you mean "did they have hitmen in the past?" that's bordering on the absurd.  Thanks for taking the hit and filling us in on what happens to a horse's tail when they poop, Carrie. Now it's back to Gulchin in the studio, who's got the weather for us. /u/Gulchin, what can you tell us about the weather this week, and indeed the general climate, in Baku, Azerbaijan?  Heinz modelled their ketchup bottle after a horse anus "OK Google" is a godsend. Especially because I’ll forget what it was I wanted to google by the time I get where I’m going  Hi, me I am the same. I will even google questions i overhear and then i have to decide whether to tell them the answer afterwards...

They should be grateful for the answer but mostly they just seem mildly irritated that i was “listening in” to their conversation.

Sadly i cant shut any conversation out, if i can make out the words, my brain is tuned in to it whether i like it or not... Ctrl+t is muscle memory now.  > What did our people do before the Internet?

Drink, probably. Probably not. I understand the urge but if someone I was speaking to did this repeatedly, I would stop talking to them. It’s really obnoxious, sorry OP.
Do you find yourself telling people little trivia nuggets about things you actually know nothing about all the time? Gosh. I’d be making my excuses and walking! No offense intended. I kinda do the oposite, I’ll think of something puzzling, open up my phone and the google app, forget what it was I was going to google, sit there staring at the blank search page trying to remember what I was thinking of. So frustrating.  true, but i think the adhd part is a. a near compulsion to google whatever it is and b. getting sucked in so suddenly its 3 hours later and you’re reading about a topic that is not at all related to your original question Good advice right there This is one of the reasons I want to be academic. It’s amazing having a job where all I’ve got to do is find more information...or at least that’s what I think the job is like. 

Anyway, I’ve got a question: does it get boring, especially when it comes to researching things *all the time*? Because that’s the only thing that is making me think twice about being an academic.  Yeah, I can’t understand how people can have this portable device where they can find so much information and not get distracted by it. Although, I am pretty sure Google has made he effects of my ADHD much worse.  Not to the point it's impacting your interactions and relationships I dunno, I have friends who never ever seem to do that and some who do it if it's a topic that's important to them. And then there are two others who, just like me, google annyyything they don't know the answer to. Pretty sure one has ADHD, not that sure about the other. 

Don't think it's a must but I'd say it makes sense with the symptoms:

I mean, I have racing thoughts that are all over the place so I often ask myself odd stuff. If there is something new like an unsolved question it grabs my attention and pulls it away from what I'm doing. I'm impulsive and can't stop myself from following the urge even though it might be inappropriate. And if my brain feels like it, I then hyperfocus on the question and won't think about anything else for the next 30 minutes.

It's definitely driven by curiosity but there are some extra things that can hint at ADHD. That doesn't mean anyone sitting around in their room googling stuff has it. yes they do. I would find what she does to be super endearing in a partner. 

To me she isn't disengaged with her environment - she's so engaged she wants to take that extra step to learn more. She's augmenting her environment. I think it's super cool and not sad at all. How would this be any different than someone pulling out a reference book on a specific topic? If you're on a nature hike, and are discussing a species of plant, if someone pulled out a reference book to provide more info would you still be annoyed? How dare someone try to contribute to expanding the breadth of knowledge of the group and disrupt whatever in the moment conversation has developed by bringing it back to a topic that was relevant only a few minutes prior!

>" It breaks my heart because it feels like she can’t just enjoy living without interrupting it to learn \[objectively useless\] facts."

This is such a terrible mentality to have! We live in the age of information and a lot of our problems boil down to people not wanting to utilize the platforms that provide information. How can it be "objectively useless" if it was information relevant to a topic of conversation that you guys' were engaged in?  It sounds like you're *subjectively ignorant.*

>" It shows a lack of desire to engage with those around her at best, and is genuinely dangerous at worst. "

You, literally, just said that she takes the information she learns and relays it to the group. So, 1) she is enjoying acquiring more information on a topic; and, 2) she is engaging with those around her b providing more information than you all had previously.

If she were pulling out her phone to scroll through social media or something and completely absent from the group, then I could see your plight. Otherwise, how dare you fault a person for wanting to *learn*, regardless of how arbitrary the topic may seem to *you.*

adding: if you truly have a "thirst for knowledge" I suggest that you take a sip because you must be awfully dehydrated at the moment. I haven't ever actually considered the need to Google everything as something that could bug people and I'm sort of upset that I haven't. I mean no one's ever complained but I'm not sure why I expected them to speak up and say "hey, you're being rude by ignoring us and googling that"  Jack of all trades, master of none, *but better than master of one* I'm tempted to get defensive and argue with you, but even in my profession, software engineering, my area of strongest expertise....

If I were even *average*, my salary would be tens of thousands higher. Jack of all trades, master of none, *but better than master of one* So I had to google it...

Dilettante:  A person who cultivates an area of interest, such as the arts, without real commitment or knowledge.  A person with an amateur interest in the arts.

(maybe save someone a few clicks) Hayduke might disagree. Annnnnd now I need to fact check this which will lead to a wasted morning of googling.  Siri isn’t smart and she’s like “I can’t look that right now while you’re driving” >:(
Or “I don’t understand what you said.” 
Or takes down a note and absolutely butchers it  THIS HAPPENS TO ME SO OFTEN. Especially when I already know the answer to their question or I hear them claim something I know is false You know, saying "no offense" before you act like a dick doesn't negate the fact that you're being a dick I do not necessarily agree with your stance, but I do think it is unfair that you have such a negative rating. 

I think you have a perfectly valid opinion, that I’m sure you are not alone in having. And your opinion contributes to the discussion. That is what reddit is supposed to be all about. 

Downvotes are not supposed to be an “I disagree” button.  For me, not at all, it doesn't get boring. Though this is especially true because I also do normal proffessional work, and have many unrelated hobbies. 

It might get boring if you don't maintain general lifestyle, or if you just only do one field, but it never has for me.

The most captivating thing about academics, for me at least, is that even if you get bored with one field, you can go to another, and your previous experience will always be somewhat transferable.   And if I get bored with a topic, and move on, I will at some point come back to it, but with even more transferable knowledge and experience. 

There are a few things I don't like about being an academic, but I do absolutely love it. You know I'm still gonna have to Google it  I do find it endearing usually. But sometimes it’s dangerous (ex: while driving), or detracts from experiencing a more complete picture of the world around (ex: while hiking).  
I do it too. I just open a tab in my phone, type the search term, and come back to the tab when it’s a better time to do so. I also try to be present when the moment calls for it. I do the exact same thing as his girlfriend, so thank you for saying this! I felt so stupid after reading how terrible he made it seem, but you’re right, it’s a lot better than pulling out your phone to scroll through Instagram.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ maybe it doesn’t bother people and I’m the weird one. Wow, what a relevant username! I like to view it as: "Jack of all trades, mastered by none." Well Master of None is like a jack of all trades. I was trying to agree with your comment not argue. Damn that sounds like my entire existence. I’m 31 and still have no idea what I want to be when I grow up. I’ve found many things I enjoy doing, but none that I can commit to for a lifetime because, you know, ADHD and stuff. Too many “but what if’s” so I’m just enjoying my time in retail, being an assistant interior designer where I can dally in a little of this and that 🙃 Thanks for saving me the inevitable trip. Damn. I had to google it before i saw this. This is even a nicer way of describing it than i found. For the people on pc who use chrome, there is an addon called Google Dictionary you can use to get definitions of words by double-clicking on them. [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=nl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=nl) I googled "Heinz ketchup bottle shape horse anus" and couldn't find anything :( The whole point of using Siri is to not use your hands, which is perfect for driving! r/assholedesign *shrug* using ADHD as an excuse to be on your phone all the time when in company of others isn’t exactly healthy either? I’m sorry I didn’t just back-pat the OP and say yeah I feel you bro. I forgot how Reddit works. Can confirm they they definetly do. In fact they are often very long and quite cute looking Yup, just did and it was worth it. Ha! I had already completely forgotten about it. Yeah, it can be annoying. But you know what else is annoying? The fact that you came to a subreddit all about ADHD and proceeded to say that one of the symptoms that many of us experience isn't even ADHD and it's just obnoxious. OP isn't using it as an excuse. They were looking for other people that experience the same thing they do, which is the whole point of this subreddit. Get over yourself.  Still gotta Google it. Don't trust anyone.  I feel you bro. Let’s all encourage indulging in our symptoms/compulsions that are socially repellent because you know, life isn’t isolating enough *fist bump*.
I just think this is an easier problem to overcome and it’s clearly already causing problems for those around OP. I’ll try find a way to be more constructive next time ok, but first I need to get over myself, but get this, sometimes disagreeing is good advice too.
