I have trouble recalling what i read and would like some tips on reading more efficiently. I am a senior in high school. In english class, I find it difficult to read because i am constantly skipping words and unable to remember them. It is even worse on phone or laptop. I am just wondering if anyone else shares this experience and has tips or tricks to help. Print out your reading

Be an active reader (highlight things and make notes)

Write a summary of each chapter

Also, meds were a huge help with respect to reading things over and over
