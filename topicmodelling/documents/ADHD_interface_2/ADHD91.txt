How to concentrate on reading? I used to read a lot of books, but now even if I read a book I'm interested in, I stop after about 30-50 pages because I'm too lazy to continue.  For me it’s sitting down to actually read that is the problem. Once I’m settled and have read a couple pages I can probably go for a few chapters but then I don’t pick the book up for another month because I always feel like I won’t enjoy it even though I know I will.  Ha. Have a feeling most comments are going to go something along the lines of: "holy shit I wish I could read that many pages. I can barely read 1-2."
Me being one of those people...
 I've had the same issue and still haven't figured it out. Reading books I liked used to help me feel calmer - I'd get immersed in them and kind of forget about whatever else was bothering me.

But I haven't been able to do that for a few years now. I think for me, part of it is depression, which I'm just starting to work on managing. I was hoping the Adderall would have helped with that, but so far it hasn't. I walk around the house when I read, seems to help a bunch  I have trouble reading too. I like reading, but I simply can't muster up the motivation to do it.
