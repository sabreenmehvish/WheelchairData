Any recommendations on rejection sensitivity reading material? Does anyone have any leads on good books, or other reading, on the subject of rejection sensitivity? I’m not finding much. Thanks. You're not finding anything because there *isn't* anything. RSD is not recognized by the medical community. The only description of it is in a blog post on ADDitude. Take anything you hear about it with a huge grain of salt. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-love-and-war/201706/how-rejection-sensitivity-derails-relationships%3famp

This also has a link to a small study on RSD. I wish I could help, but unfortunately people with RSD are left to their own devices.

Because this is a sensitive subject, its literally in the name, feel free to pm me if you want to exchange ideas/experiences, rather than discuss here. I'm curious too. My Dr says it's not a real thing (he has ADHD too). I do think it's a thing but not necessarily tied to ADHD. I'd like to see some studies on it though as I see it mentioned more and more.  I only know of it formally existing as a symptom of atypical depression in the DSM 5... try looking for material with that search term \(atypical depression\) and more stuff does come up, but that psychology today article is the best I've found. I have access to journal articles if anyone's interested...  one article that seems promising I found is called "Gender\-based rejection sensitivity and academic self\-silencing in women." I'm in the middle of reading it, happy to send it along Thanks good to know! Thank you.  Thank you Thank you. That’s what my therapist said today, that I atypical depression, I will def try looking that up instead. I remembered that I’ve seen rejection sensitivity mentioned a bunch on this sub so I thought I would ask.
