I was just reading something that explains the correlation between boredom and sadness and it said the feeling of emptiness or sadness you get when you're bored is a motivation tactic. I think my brain tries to go through that invention mode but nothing really comes of it. I just feel restless instead? I take my meds and set my mind to doing an assignment or something but I end up just sitting there feeling bored and unsatisfied.

I really fucking hate having free time. Boredom is what you feel when your not pursuing your mission. A mentor told me that recently and it stuck with me. I can definitely relate to what you told me, it makes me want to have more goals to pursue. I’m honestly not sure what’s worth pursuing, for so long before meds I’ve just struggled to have a normal life! I try to have some backup activities like going on a long run, going hiking, going bouldering, taking my dog to the dog park, in my mind (and written down in my phone) at all times. Because once I start getting bored, I'm miserable and restless and it's harder to think/plan something then.
