Reading 7 books But now that I am medicated, I can actually finish some of them!  Same here! Last week I paid off past library fees, borrowed a book, read it in three days, & returned it!!! I’m shook lol it’s impossible for me to finish books much less return them! Yeah I managed to get through a 400 page pdf in the course of a month, definitely felt accomplishment. Most of the time though i'd flick to youtube, open up about 8-10 video's -that i will be watching one after the other- (i'd pause one halfway through and play another because I got bored) then few hours of this be like oh yeah I forgot about the book... So I played a game of CSGO.
