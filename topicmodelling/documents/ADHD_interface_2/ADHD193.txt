I'm putting off doing an expense report while reading an article on procrastination WTF is wrong with me??! Story of my life!  Reading this at work Mine too I wish I had some good advice! Mine is usually procrastinating reading articles on procrastination while I add them to my Instapaper (that I will definitely read later) and moving onto the next article.
