Idea for improving compulsive article-reading Insist on replying to the article in-depth. If it helps, you can pretend the author sent this article specifically to you, to get your thoughts on it or to help you with your research. But they expect a thoughtful reply, or they'll assume you're blowing them off.

This would normally still be quite daunting, but I got an idea recently while writing long emails back and forth with my girlfriend. When I have an email with several long-ish paragraphs, I typically reply in-line like this:

>> How do you like this in-line reply style?
> 
> Oh, it's lovely. Much better than commenting on Google Docs.
> 
>> The weather here is terrible. We've had blustery thunderstorms all week. Worse yet, I've lost my umbrella!
> 
> Oh man, that sucks. I actually kind of like the weather here, problematic as it is. I finally get to see snow again.

[(Also called "interleaved reply style", according to Wikipedia.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Interleaved_style)

Anyone else like the idea, or have anything to add to it? I think it could use a nice method for reminding the habit, and maybe a more fluid interface than copy-pasting to a separate editor. Like a greasemonkey script or browser add-on (or maybe just some cheap trick).
