Cool Study Tool I'm not usually one of those folks that needs to talk about other websites or anything, but I stumbled across a free study tool that's really helping me a lot. Memrise is basically a bunch of flashcard sets that helps you memorize things that you need to know. They have flashcards that help with every conceivable thing you might be interested--there are lots of foreign language things, but surprisingly, there are even things for the CompTIA A+ exam that I'm studying for. The interface is sort of set up like a video game, so you can "level up" by reviewing more and more flashcards. It's really helping me stay motivated. Just passing it along in case someone else might get some use out of it.

Oh, and if you want to add me as a friend, I am "samurai_pizza_cat"
