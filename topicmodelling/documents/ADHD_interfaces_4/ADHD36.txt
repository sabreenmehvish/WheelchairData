This app 30/30 is super helpful and free! I discovered this app a couple of weeks ago. Im an unmedicated stay at home mom and focus is.... Well, you all know. For me it's house chores and remembering to put the kids in the tub, give them lessons, do the dishes, move the laundry. All things that take up very little time but if its out of sight it's out of mind. 

With this app you set how long it takes to do something (2 minutes tidy up doorway, 10 minutes load/unload dishwasher Etc.) and after each task it beeps and instantly starts a new task. I have never gotten so much done in a short amount of time before. You can make multiple lists and the interface is very nice. Colour coded, icons, gesture based (though it took a bit to get used to the gestures I love it now)

Tanks for letting me toot about this app. The link is

Cheers. This seems great. Anyone know of an android equivalent? downloading this now. thanks! Thanks for the tip! I agree! I use this app all the time, its very customizable for any task youre doing.   If it is zebreke, its the only one this user has posted. Ever. 

Looks promising OP, will check it out this week  downloading now...thanks this may be just what i needed I feel like this is an advertisement.

I sense.....a disturbance.....in the Reddit. It's not time based but 'Koalcat's Clear' is a pretty decent list app. It's free so just try it out. i have used an interval timer to do something similar.   I use any.do as a get-things done type app. There is no timer, but its an easy to do list, can set up alarms, and other cool stuff too. When you miss a call, it registers in the app and has options to either call the person back or put it on your to do list.
