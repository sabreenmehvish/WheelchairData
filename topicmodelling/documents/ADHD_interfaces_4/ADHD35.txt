Made Careless Mistakes At Work, Almost Got Fired **Background:** 22M, College Student, ADHD-C, 60mg Vyvanse

**The Job** I work part time as an "Office Assistant" at an insurance agent's office. Started there in May. It's an easy job but there are a ton of tiny little procedural details. I make marketing calls, take calls into the office, do basic customer service stuff and process payments. Recently, someone left the office so they have been giving me more responsibilities. 

**Note:** It's been difficult for actually, since my mother tried to kill herself a month ago, and I was fortunate to be there to stop her. My boss knows about that situation.

**The fuckups:** It's actually 4 mistakes in 1. Two of them aren't really worth mentioning since they were minor, procedural things (think details). My boss was livid with me this morning. She said that I could have been fired for what I did. She told me she's given me too much responsibility and is now severely limiting me as to what I can and cannot do. She told me I did a great job at first but now it seems that I need to just do the basic things for the time being. Her and other's are constantly needing to re-explain things to me. They don't say it but I can tell they are annoyed with me.

**1.)** First, I forgot to fully submit a payment into the system (it's literally a M-DOS interface, not kidding) and a policyholder had a policy go out of force. Had I made the payment properly it would have been fine. The client will not have any financial problems and corporate should be able make it right. 

**2.)** Second, whenever I get there, the first thing the front desk lady does is hand me a stack of mail and payments to go through. Usually for some reason, she hands me the empty envelope along with the check it came in. I forgot to look through one of the envelopes and almost threw out a check. The boss always goes through my trash bin and found it there fortunately before it went into the dumpster.

I feel like a fucking idiot. After getting berated, I don't think I've felt such a severe level of self hatred in years. I can't even do desk jockey work with proficiency or effectiveness. 

**TL;DR Fucked up with money at work, almost got fired. I feel stupid and worthless** I know it's hard, but don't let people at work have power over your self esteem and your self love. So you goofed up -- it happens to literally everyone. Forgive yourself, my friend. Your worth as a person is not related at all to whether you mess up at work.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to improve. Is there some system you could put in place? A little list with a collection of important reminders? But when you do have a goof, be kind to yourself about it. It happens. 

If your boss reacts inappropriately to such goofs, that's on her. With our self esteem issues it can be hard to remember this, but we are not deserving of belittling and berating just because of who we are. On the other hand, workplace conflicts will happen, and we have to be okay with that without it causing negative self talk. Even if you DID get fired, there are so many other jobs out there and a whole lifetime to find them. 

Sending good vibes your way!  Your mistakes have nothing to do with stupidity, your brain just naturally does not pay constant attention to repetitive, boring tasks.

Your boss sounds a bit OCD, maybe its simply not the right job or environment for you.

You can only try your best, what more can you do? screw them Lessons learned. Try not to take it too personally. Take responsibility and learn from those mistakes. Do the best you can. To be fair, your mistakes may have actually called her to action and get the other employee replaced so you have a more manageable workload - sometimes people (even bosses) need to learn from *their* mistakes too.

Make sure you take notes when people explain things to you so you don't forget and need to have things re-explained. She kinda is OCD. Notes in policyholder files must be formatted in a certain way, emails sent to her have to be formatted too with as much specificity as possible, I have to use certain word tracks at the beginning and end of every phone conversation. You get the picture.

Edit: Probably not the right job or environment for me but as a college student with even little entry level experience as it stands, I am lucky to even have this job.
