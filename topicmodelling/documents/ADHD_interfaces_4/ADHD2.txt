I never believed in ADHD/ADD until now.. Hi Reddit.

[**TLDR: Skip to #5 or #6**]

**.::Backstory (#1-#2)**

1. I have been suffering from anxiety all my life, about 8 years now. I've been to multiple and copious psychiatrists. I was on benzos including Klonopin & Xanax for 2 years of my life. Which worked pretty well for a while until my tolerance went up & i depended on them for relief heavily. I also used oxycodone on the side because that was the first thing that helped my anxiety and helped me in school immensely. I decided to stop using them and go natural 4 years ago after getting addicted to copious narcotics, hitting roadblocks in my life and not dealing with them correctly. I ruined a 4 year relationship, my college grades, respect from my friends and family & much more in rapid succession. I went to rehab and i came out & i have since been clean. 

2. However, now that i am in my adult life and i need to work & do things, having extreme anxiety to the point where i can't leave my house is just unnaceptable. I have ruined numerous opportunties because of it. I decided to bite the bullet and go back to a psychiatrist but only for the intention of helping myself and not abusing substances.

**.::Psych Visit (#3-#4)**

3. This psych put me on something called "Prazosin" in the beginning and it made me feel extremely tired and drained. However, it did calm me down. Also, if she never put me on this i would have never brought up that i feel impulsive and that prazosin helps me sit still.

4. I brought up interesting things about how its nice to not walk around always etc etc and she made me fill out paperwork. At the end i felt so bad because i filled it out honestly and i felt like something was wrong with me. She concluded that i have ADHD that exacterbates my anxiety. Of course i didn't believe it, but i said to myself to get the most out of this experience i needed to be honest with myself and not stubborn and take the medicine. She ended up giving me **Vyvanse®** (Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate).

**.::Experience (#4-#6)**

4. Taking **Vyvanse®** for a few weeks was wow. I found it difficult to think about so many distracting bad negative thoughts at once. I'd do things way more efficiently (Instead of getting up 4 times to get for different things from my room, i'd do it in one trip) I found interest that i had lost in old things such as playing video games and i was much better at it. At first it was hard to eat and sleep, but i noticed after a few weeks that the side effects subsided and sleep was actually easier. To my surprise it reduced the time it took to fall asleep because i wasn't thinking of what to do tomorrow, what to wear, how am i going to do this, and events of the past that i was always anxious about. I told her all this and she said that the ADHD was probably exacterbating my anxiety for a very long time.

5. On **Vyvanse®** i do not feel impending doom, i don't feel anxious, and after a few more weeks i found my perfect dose and im just continually taking it. It's so strange to not feel sedated and foggy and not be anxious (like on benzos & strange in a good way) but to be sharper and confident and normal and not be anxious. I've been suffering for 8 years with anxiety and its very unbelieveable. 

6. Because of Vyvanse i realized a lot of things i've been doing wrong, or suffering with, or that is unnecessary and i have been fixing it accordingly and trying to live an even better lifestyle than before. I am very greatful. 


**.::Notes**

**I have been studying pharmacology for 6 years unnoficially and officially, i always have skipped amps because they had no use or interest in my mind before ironically. Now i see the value of it.**

**I did adderall once a while ago before this and it made me feel like to shoot myself on the comedown and made me very depressed sad, and spiked my anxiety ten-fold (this is why i didn't want to go back to try any amps again), i judged them way too fast from one experience.**

Any ideas why this stuff helps my anxiety? A scientific pharmacological answer would be nice. I always believe only GABA receptors could influence calmness rapidly & maybe the fluctuation of serotonin. I was diagnosed years ago with GAD then SAD then MDD. Now its ADHD. I can certainly say for sure I AM NOT DEPRESSED even with anxiety, maybe before but not now.

Thanks for reading.

- O.S I can point you to some cognitive psychology that might explain...

Obviously this is only theory to some extent, and not all experts buy into this particular theory (from what I can gather there are 2 main camps, Barkley and Brown). Part 3 is about how executive functioning interfaces with the limbic system and what that means for ADHD - if correct it would explain how a drug that improves EF in the frontal lobe could help with mood and emotion. I'm not sure what the other theories say about how the limbic system comes into play.

[Part 2](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=M8dLiH1LFx8)

[Part 3](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=30s&v=sPFmKu2S5XY)

EDIT: I think part 3 makes more sense if you watch also watch 1 and 2, even though they aren't direarly about EF's interface with the  limbic system - it all works together (or doesn't so well with us, haha)!

Barkley has other lectures (and obv. written material if you prefer) on how emotion is related to ADHD. But I think the full series above is a great background for understanding anything about ADHD. Assuming it is correct, of course! Either way, he draws upon studies of structural and functional neuroanatomy abnormalities in ADHDers, which given your background might give you ideas related. I don't think the video includes his references slide though.

And [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LnS0PfNyj4U) on meds. Sorry, this one is not very detailed at all, not meant for pharmacologists! But it briefly mentions how stimulants and non-stimulants impact the limbic system differently. Probably all in your textbooks, but in case it's a different approach, here it is.

I can tell you that a lot of professionals (including my providers) believe that depression and anxiety in ADHDers is often *caused by* the ADHD, not merely exacerbated by it. Some people only need ADHD meds to nix it. Others need to augment. Wellbutrin and Lexapro are very commonly used for that.

Let us know what you find out as you dig deeper! And if you find inaccuracies, too! I don't have time to verify what he says - I just recommemd it because it makes sense to me.

EDIT 2: I saw a post from someone (not an academic/health professional) who emailed questions to Barkley a couple years ago, and he actually responded! So if you're really motivated.....!
