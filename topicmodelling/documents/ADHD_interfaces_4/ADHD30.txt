What's helped me save money as an ADHDer *EDIT: Stock investment may not be your best bet for saving money if your lack of self control is wayy worse than the average person with ADHD, but if you feel your impulsiveness is somewhere in the middle or lower end of the spectrum then you should be fine.*

Hi, guys!

&nbsp;

So what I wanna talk about is the stock marke-- No no wait come back! I'm serious! **I never ever evverrr imagined I'd find investing interesting, either**. I'm an artist for a living so anything regarding the stock market or finances has always scared the ever-loving crap out of me. Juggling numbers is difficult when I can hardly manage to put away money with a typical bank/savings account. Looking at spreadsheets is boring as hell. I had failed at sustaining any real savings for so long that in the past that it was easier to blame my debt/bills/life than even try to stick to a frugal budget anymore. Realistically though, you don't have to have a lot of money or fiscal knowhow to invest. It can be incredibly engaging for our hyper-focusing brains, but can be incredibly simple if you don't want to pay attention to it. 

&nbsp;

To add to that, money sitting in a checking/savings account normally loses value over time due to inflation whereas money invested in stocks follows the value of the market. Major plus.

&nbsp;

Here's some points that helped me out:

1. Check out an app called **Robinhood**. It's free and unlike just about every other broker, it allows you to trade for free. If I had to keep track of paying for every transaction, I'd have given up immediately. You can start investing with really small amounts of money because you aren't charged anything to do it. It also has an extremely easy to use interface so it doesn't feel overwhelming.

2. **There is a difference between investing and speculation**. Investing is focused on the long term with moderate returns. Speculation is oriented toward short term trades and is high-risk like gambling.

3. **Read up on companies already within your realm of knowledge**. It is so much more rewarding if you're putting money into an industry you already have an interest in. So if you're in, say, game development then read up on stuff like Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Activision/ Blizzard, Autodesk, and Adobe, NOT some shipping vessel or gold mining company. Find something you are confident WILL have a solid 5 years ahead of it. Something you can forget about. RH shows a 5 year history for stocks, so go with something that has a consistent climb. 

4. Put most of 60-70% of your stock in that top choice. 25-35% can go into your number two pick, hopefully in as separate an industry from your first pick you can manage and still feel confident about. You want insurance in case there's a catastrophe in your first stock's industry.

5. If you aren't sure what to pick as your number one, dividends and indexes tend to yield consistently positive results. Choose one that successful investors like Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffet own stock in. [Here's a list of extremely successful investors](http://www.dataroma.com/m/managers.php). 

6. Your last 5% or so of stock is something to learn with. While you should always remember that **all stocks are a gamble and you should be prepared to lose money with them**, fully expect to lose this money with this 5% for now. You can put it in a growth stock or toss a few dollars into a few cheap speculations to get the impulsive ADHDness out of your system. You'll probably learn quickly that penny stocks are volatile and dangerous, but some people are really into it. Just please be careful. 

7. There's no pressure to pay too much attention to your stock if you've done your due diligence and know it's solid. You should be able to put money into them and forget about them if you want. However, if it's a company you really have an interest in it only helps to keep up on it so you can make smart moves as time goes on (thank you hyperfocus!).

8. Again, do your own due diligence. Trust others sparingly and trust yourself confidently. A lot of people may say a stock is hot but the sheer volume of people buying it could be pumping up its value and cause it to plummet hard. If it's already gained 30% in a day, odds are you already missed the train and that's fine. Let the stock you have faith in keep humming along even if it dips a bit. If it's strong it'll bounce back.

9. **Funds have to settle for a few days if you want to withdraw them or move them to another stock. This is very good for our impulsive ADHD brains**. It forces us to stop and think about what we're doing with it so we don't  impulsively blow it all on Cheezits or our 5th new hobby this month.

10. Robinhood allows you to to use a stop loss and limit feature so you can sell stocks automatically if they get too high or too low. It helps keep things from getting out of hand when you're not looking.

11. RH only allows you to trade US stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. I *think* the app itself might only be available in the US, too.

12. r/stocks, r/robinhood, and r/securityanalysis can be really helpful. There are tons of interviews on Youtube with Warren Buffet where he breaks down the principles into easily digestable concepts. There are plenty of good finance channels on Youtube to help you learn. Preston Pysh and Financial Education aren't bad. "The Intelligent Investor" and "Learn to Earn" are great books on the subject.

13. Be extremely wary of r/Wallstreetbets and get rich quick strategies.

14. Stocktwits.com is a double-edged sword. It can provide up to the second news but you have to wade through a lot of crap. 90%+ of people on there don't know what they're talking about.

15. Random note- Since the market opens at 6:30 West Coast time, I've gotten into the habit of waking up earlier just to see how things are faring. Normally around that time you'll see some interesting spikes in values. I know a lot of people with ADHD have trouble with their sleep schedules and this was certainly a nice little push for me shift my morning routine (if you can call it that) a couple hours ahead.

Enjoy watching your nestegg grow! Remember, no one cares more about your money than you so trust your own judgment!

**TLDR: Stocks by design keep you from wanting to touch your money once its invested and they only require as much attention as you want to give them. Also, the Robinhood app makes investing free, engaging, and insanely easy.** Cool to know about. Thanks for putting this together.
