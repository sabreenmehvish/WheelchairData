What scheduling programs do you use? I need suggestions. I'm looking for a nice, easy-to-use scheduling program! Something like You Need A Budget, but for scheduling my day. I could use a spreadsheet, but I'd like something with gentle reminders/encouragements/more guidance, and I'd use my planner but it doesn't have enough room for everything!

Ideally I'd like something with colour coding options for classes, homework, appointments, etc. and a nice interface! If it's free or has a student discount, even better. I use google calendar.  It's free and has all the features you referred to.   I use Google Calendar, in conjunction with Google Keep so I have multiple reminders for important things, as well as a daily to-do list. I also use Google Now reminders for recurring events.
All of these are available on multiple platforms, but Keep isn't currently available on iOS.

Edit: I use these tools on my Android phone, Chromebook and Chromebox. The Chrome devices are essentially web browsers, so anything I use can run in Chrome for Windows, Mac or Linux, too. Essential PIM.  

I can sync my android phone and my computer with out having to go through the cloud or use a wire.

works on windows, mac, android.  It would help if you told us what operating system you use, what brand of phone you own, and if you prefer web to desktop applications.  Inbox and Google calendar. Inbox has made my life better by leaps and bounds.  After checking Google Calendar, which is pretty good, but not what I was looking for, I'm starting to think an excel sheet will be the only way to have exactly what I need. unfortunately :\ Uncalendar is a phenomenal paper tool.

Electronically, I use the google suite of services.  This worked better when I was allowed to have my cell phone at my desk, but such is life. Right, sorry! I use Windows 8 and an Android running lollipop. Ideally I'd like a desktop application, and if it can sync with a phone app even better.
