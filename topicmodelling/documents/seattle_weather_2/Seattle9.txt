 Will this sub ever disallow / delete boring sunset pictures. If I see one more sunrise/set pic from Kerry park im going to lose it. Are you a fan of Steampunk, Victorian era, sci-fi, horror & fantasy art & entertainment? Come to Seattle's one & only Steampunk convention!

Steamposium is October 26-28th on Pier 66, and the best way to support smaller conventions is to purchase badges in advance instead of at the door. We count on badge sales to help us pay for the venue, our celebrities & performers, and all of the other uniquely steamtacular events that Steamposium has provided for the past 4 years. If you haven’t already done so, get your badges & tell your friends; help us make our 5th year as magical as the rest!

Can't decide between Steamposium & GekkGirlCon? No problem! GGC badges get you into the Steamposium vendor hall & panels for FREE! You also get discounted admission to our after hours burlesque & live music performances!

From all of us at Steamposium, thank you! We look forward to seeing you at the Bell Harbor International Conference Center next weekend.

[https://seattle-steamposium.com](https://seattle-steamposium.com) Hi all, I'm looking to move to seattle this summer and work in some biotech company for a year while I apply to my PhD (hopefully at UW). Anyone know any good resources to browse for companies that would be good for me? any advice or tips appreciated I’ll be in Seattle Friday - Tuesday. What type of clothing/coats/outerwear should I pack? I’m coming from Arizona and we’ve still got out our shorts, tanks and flip flops. 

Also, any cool events going on this upcoming weekend?? Thanks!!  BLOCKCHAIN MeetUp - A week from today, November 1. Check out Eventbrite for details and to RSVP.

Thanks! Have you voted? My girlfriend will have an internship in Renton next summer (May - August).  Does anyone have any recommendations on finding furnished housing for those three months?  Airbnb prices all look to be 2.5k+ per month unless I am dong something wrong here.  I am a remote software dev so will need good wifi as well. What parts of Seattle should I look for apartments in if I want to have plenty of activities to do in the evenings or rather a nightlife? A couple of friends and myself will be visiting Seattle for a few days from Nov. 14-18. Any suggestions on things to see and what to expect for the weather? Of course we’ve already got places like Pikes Place, Olympic Park, and the space needle on our list but is there any suggestions on must see places? We are celebrating a birthday while we’re there as well and welcome any good bar recommendations! No, they are mandatory.  The commissar will be to your location shortly to re-educate you with percussive maintenance. Fyi, dont go. This got cancelled. Steampunk is one step above furries.

Vaporwave is the new aesthetic. I'm guessing you've already looked at UW medicine, but make sure you check out the [UW job board](https://uwhires.admin.washington.edu/eng/candidates/?szLocationID=88), not everything makes it to the job aggregation sites. Adaptive seemed to always be hiring. Not sure if they are still rapidly expanding. [removed] Bring a pretty heavy coat if you're used to warmer weather. I's mid-50s during the day, down into the 40s evenings and at night. For cool stuff to do, check out [The Stranger's events guide](https://www.thestranger.com/events/). A lot will depend on what you're into. Layering will be your friend, especially if you aren't accustomed to the weather. Long pants, shirt, over-shirt (button up or long-sleeve), a sweater, and a jacket. Even indoors will probably feel cool to you, so having layers will let you adjust how much you're wearing more than a single parka. 

If you have thermal underwear, that may be the simplest method, and then just go with the light fall coat or hoody over a regular (still long pants) outfit. You will be looked down upon if you don’t wear a light jacket and behave as if nothing is different. She can live with you, and you can use your rainman like brain to figure something out. If you can afford it, probably Capital Hill. [removed] If you are looking for a day trip, taking the ferry to Bainbridge Island is easy. The island has a nice walk-able (smallish) downtown. Great for coffee/food, wine-tasting, and shopping.

The University of Washington is in session, but it's campus is really nice to wander around. The fountain and quad are good to see, and if you're a Harry Potter fan you'll love Suzzalo Library. If the weather is co-operating (unlikely) Rainier vista is one of the nicest views of the mountain from inside the city.

As for weather, it's slated to rain all that period, though it will vary in severity. My advice is to just go with it and not worry too much. Make sure to pack a raincoat. We get wet here, but everyone dries out eventually. Also depends where you're from. We tend to get constant drizzle more than heavy storms, which may affect you more or less.

I'm not up to date on bar recommendations, but Rachel's Ginger Beer is a local favorite. Best moscow mule's around.

Just a (pedantic) heads up, but it's Pike Place, rather than Pikes Place. Bro vaporwave hasn’t been cool since 2013 thanks this is helpful, I was looking uw jobs on indeed but this seems to have more listed.  jeez asshole, I've looked through Google, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, indeed, etc.... I'm just looking for extra resources Alex, just give it a rest. Awesome! Thanks so much! Thanks! I was definitely planning on layering with and I've got the following packed: undershirts, light jacket, a fleece north face, a vest and a lined rain jacket. It typically drops to the 50's for a month or two here in AZ but I think I'm most worried about the sudden change in 90 degree to mid-50's. I've only been in AZ for 3 years and going back to my home state back east during the winter, you'd think I've never been around cold weather lol.  I don't live in Seattle.  I'm planning on moving over as well. WTF is wrong with you? This is incredibly helpful, thank you so much! Just ignore him; he's clearly bored and trolling this morning. Good luck with your PhD, though; I don't have any resources for you but Seattle is chock full of biotech industries, so hopefully you'll find something. Hey, you laugh, but I’ve gotten people to actually not move here.

I’m doing my part, would you like to know more? I'll offer you a welcome then. I hope you can ignore Alex. If you need any tips or help acclimating, don't be a stranger. Though I don't have any insights on affordable short-term housing, there's little enough of that long-term in Seattle's metro. You could try not.  That’s the more reccomended option.
