When the weather on Granite Mountain is 10/10  There should probably be some snow on those peaks by now. That stinging wind was 10/10? Nice! That looks like a great spot to wingsuit from What peak is that in the distance?! And is that an old fire lookout? Not much snow looking south. The view to the north is a lot snowier because the peaks are taller. You can see Baker, Glacier, and Stuart, among others.  You’re right. Visibility was 10/10. Wind was trash.  That’s Rainier to the south.  Do you live in Washington!?
