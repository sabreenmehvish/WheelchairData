PS: SOmething outside of Seattle to relax for 2 days Repost of my answer to a similar question, this is a good two day trip combines interesting nature and old towns "[Port Gamble](https://goo.gl/maps/kpwmjmgdyEt) (Cool old town, cool graveyard, [funky sea shell museum](http://www.portgamble.com/museum)), [Port Townsend](https://goo.gl/maps/DV6JjT9mbJH2) (Cool old town, [good cheese](https://mttownsendcreamery.com/), [good cider](https://www.finnriver.com/), [Fort Warden](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/fort-worden-state-park-point-wilson) (for it's hike up the hill and walking around the old barracks), [Sequim](https://goo.gl/maps/wjs5t7qhbSp) ([Dungeness Spit](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/dungeness-national-wildlife-refuge) hike is nice even if you don't do the entire thing... one side is a protected bird sanctuary)"

Pick a San Jaun Island: Orcas has the best [hikes](https://goo.gl/maps/uvK8PWD1Y682) while San Juan has the best [amenities](https://goo.gl/maps/dpaBiVVct4m)

&#x200B; Portland.  Port Townsend or Whidbey island would be nice. All depends what you want to do and how far you want to go  Wineries and breweries in Woodinville, stay at Willows Lodge and do dinner at the Herbfarm if you can still get a reservation.  San Juans.   Woodinville wine county  Use the money to buy weed and alcohol. Just enjoy Seattle that way. Funner.  This!! We just recently got back from celebrating our 1 year and did Hood Canal, Anacortes, and Whidbey. I think it rained a few times, but we got amazing airbnbs and then there is wine and cider tastings so we had plenty to do and the views were still breathtaking. We did one hike also when the weather cleared.  Portland has great bars, coffee shops, and restaurants. Nice places to walk either downtown or day trip out to the Gorge and Multnomah Falls area. There are a number of couples friendly strip clubs if that appeals to you. No sales tax so if you have a large purchase to make you can subsidize your trip a bit.  Are those good option in terms of weather.. Im planning mid-nov time frame You chose the wrong part of the country for good weather in mid November.  Possibly? All depends on what you want to do. It’s the Pac NW in November, it’s probably going to be cold and raining, as if that’s a surprise.
