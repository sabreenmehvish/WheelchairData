First Time in Seattle and it’s Breathtaking  Caught us on a good day Wow looks like a video game after you defeat the final boss and sleep on the grass. The weather here is incredible. I've heard all my life about how dreary and miserable it is but in my time here it has been beautiful weather. 

The summer is amazing the fall is amazing and the winters are mild. The gray days don't last that long. There's very little if zero wind or serious thunderstorms. All in all it's one of the best climates in the US. Not to mention it's just beautiful everywhere. It was much brighter where i was, was a nice surprize :O pink door! go eat at the pink door 💕 Plus it rains 85% of the year.   Yeah it is. Now go home and don't tell anyone about us. I’d say Seattle is best through Spring to Fall. Anything else is cloudy, 30-50 degrees, windy, and more rain you thought possible that could ever come down in such a short time span.  Yeah, sadly we don’t usually get those sunsets.  I don't know where you've been living, but it's not Seattle.

The Summers are the trap that lures people in.  When there's a good one, there might be no better spot on earth to be - between July 5th and October 1st, since that's the extent of it.  Of course, the problem is, 3 of the last 5 years haven't been good summers (either because of extreme heat, wildfires, or summer deciding it didn't want to show up).

The grey days don't last that long?  It was either last year or the year before that there were a total of 3 sunny days between October 1st and April 30th.  It made national news.  Even when it doesn't, you will literally got months without seeing the sun.  When you first move to the area, the grey doesn't really bother you/you don't really notice it.  But once you've been there for a few years, you start to pick up on it, and it becomes more and more prevalent the longer you stay.  It wears you down.  There's tons of wind.  Literally the only thing you said that was accurate was the lack of thunderstorms, though many people like an occasional one of those, and that the area is aesthetically pleasing as long as you don't look up.

Seattle is a fantastic place....to visit.  I recommend everybody do it.  But you make it sound like it's some sort of climatologists Shangri-lah, and that's just a flat-out lie unless you're one of those people who derive joy from dreariness.  Hell, living there used to be what was referred to as "the overcast discount" because it had a lot of the same amenities and culture as places like San Francisco, but then the COL spiked and you don't even have that anymore. > There's very little if zero wind

Well, now, that's just [not true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_windstorm). No thunderstorms, but we sure as hell have wind. 2017 and 2018 have been remarkably light on wind, though. Too late, my job is moving me here. Well, the cloudy/temp/windy part is true.

But you make it sound like it rains hard here with the "more rain you thought possible that could ever come down in such a short time span" comment.  Hard rain here is super rare, compared to most places I've lived. the last three summers we've gotten some great ones due to terrible air pollution Yeah and on the rare occasion that we do get a sunset, no one manages to get any pictures of them. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️  IMO the weather here is better than many parts of the country that face extreme heat (all over the country), humidity (NYC, Houston, ...), bitter cold (I visited Tulsa where despite no snow the wind chill was bone chilling), or other events like hurricanes (South east) and tornadoes (Mid-west etc.)

People manage to complain about it because despite the generally milder temperatures, it's not perfect So-Cal weather and posts like yours look like they exaggerate not because the weather objectively is "bad" but because you just don't want more people moving here. Yep I remember the 3 days of sun.  Also it rained for like 23 days in a row of that October.  

So many posts about "the weather is actually great here" makes me think they've been here for one season or a short trip. The year with no sun you refer to almost broke me. I'm a native, it wears on you and may be cumulative. I'll let you know for sure next July. Wow, who peed in your Cheerios? OP made a subjective statement. I've been in the area 5 years, and I'd agree with OP that there's very little if zero wind compared to where I was in the Midwest. Yup, born and raised here myself, we'll get maybe 3 or 4 heavy rainstorms a year. 98% of the time it just sprinkles all day instead of dumping everything in 10 minutes like it does in Florida, where my wife is from. So, you've got a different interpretation of what "weather" is to most.  For one, most people don't consider natural disasters to be a part of "weather".  


Seattle's weather is a little different in that it doesn't punch you in the mouth the way a Boston winter morning or an Atlanta summer day will, but that doesn't make it any better.  I've always equated some other parts of the country with 1 decidedly terrible season as a knife stab and Seattle/Portland as a millstone.  Just grinds you down, slowly but surely.  

Sorry, but you're arguing that the climate is so much better in an area where there have been study after study showing that it plays a huge part as to why there are more depressed people per capita in Seattle than anywhere else in the country. Or some people, like myself, prefer the constant rain and clouds of winter here.  Now that I think about it, it was year before last that we had that year.  I've got a buddy who would make a post every year about what he and his S/O called "The October Conversation".  It was basically sitting down each year and deciding whether they were going to stick around and subject themselves to another grey season.  Last year's conversation went differently in that it was less a conversation and more an ultimatum from his long-time girlfriend to get her the hell out of here or else they were through, because it \*\*did\*\* break her.

They ended up moving to Denver, and now all the posts about weather are "just another sunny day in the Mile High City" or "it snowed yesterday morning but then the sun came out and today it's 60 degrees and sunny, so we're going for a hike.  Oh, it's 40 degrees and cloudy in Seattle?  That sounds so sad!" and while the rest of us were melting in Seattle this summer, they were posting about how it was 81 and not a cloud in the sky with clean air.  I'm pretty sure they've proven they're smarter than all of us. Ahhhh, there's that Seattle passive aggressiveness that was missing from the thread.  A comment with nothing but factual statements, and there's gotta be the clown that takes offense and thinks that it's somehow an insult to them personally. I guess, to be fair, Seattle itself is a bit sheltered -- I'm from Bellingham originally, and the wind is definitely stronger up there. The Florida statement is spot on lol, I live there and it will rain so hard you can't see directly in front of you for like 10-15 minutes and then the sun comes out like nothing happened.  >For one, most people don't consider natural disasters to be a part of "weather".

You're trying to debate the definition of a word. If hurricanes or tornadoes are things you generally expect each year, some years stronger than others, then they're more or less part of "Here's what to expect if I decide to move to this town/city/...".

>Seattle's weather is a little different in that it doesn't punch you in the mouth the way a Boston winter morning or an Atlanta summer day will, but that doesn't make it any better.

Your statement is purely objective. If I have trouble walking in the snow or if my tolerance to heat or cold is different, then I'll have a different preference, and to me, one is *better* than the other.

>Sorry, but you're arguing that the climate is so much better in an area where there have been study after study showing that it plays a huge part as to why there are more depressed people per capita in Seattle than anywhere else in the country.

I'm stating the weather is better for some people relative to other places in the country. Depression may be a result of long stretches of overcast, but that's orthogonal to the point I am making.

I prefer 60 degrees overcast vs. 100 degrees sunny with humidity. 100 studies proving that Seattle climate leads to depression doesn't change my preference. 

Sorry, but you're trying to hard. :( I agree, for some people this climate is amazing.  Just don't want to make people believe it's often Sunny :) Colorado is on my wife's and my short list as an escape city, your post confirms my belief there is something else out there for us. :) I've spent several weeks there during the summer months and started to get used to the pattern of 85-90 degrees until 3pm, then the almost daily storm would roll in, the temp would fall to 70 and there would be an absolute torrential downpour,  then the sun would come back out. Next thing you know the temp swings back up to 92 degrees, but now with 90% humidity. Miserable. I'm already annoyed with the forecast for next week.
