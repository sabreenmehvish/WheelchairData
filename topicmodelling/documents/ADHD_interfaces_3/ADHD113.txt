Tips for studying? Does anyone have any tips for procrastination/day dreaming whilst reading? I can't seem to stay on task and my mind keeps wandering whilst I read. I got several bags of lollies to reward myself whilst I study, but I keep eating them before I actually start studying... May I ask what kind of book, lecture notes or whatever you are reading? (long texts or mathematical proofs or graphics/diagrams ...)

There are some differences on how to handle that.

But apart from that, I cant study without making any visual progress. Just reading something, makes me neither understand it completely, nor give the ability to recall every detail.

Writing important pars by myself down and seeing interactions, and consequences from those facts, helps me a lot.
I have to admit, that I work strongly vision based and need either absolute silence or music loud enough to cancel all environmental noises in order to concentrate.
I guess that's because of my inability to filter any stimuli. I really only need to draw out the principles of the cases. Which for example is like the principle of this case is that if you sign a document then you are bound. Spotting the principle isn't always that easy though D: Law textbooks.... 
 I always take notes on what I'm reading, whether or not it is necessary. For my notes I structure them with setting, big ideas, important quotes. So then once you have the set up, you know what you are reading to find out. That's one of the ways that has helped me focus when reading, by going in with what I am looking for.  I can't remember where I saw a specific concept on how to work exactly this problem, but the method was based on iterative working.

It is not a time efficient method, but get's better results in filtering those texts for specific information. Your goal is to get them 'phrase by phrase' in your memory?

Or do you have a specific task, which requieres you to use results from those books?
