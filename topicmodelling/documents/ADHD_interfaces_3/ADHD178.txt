I used to be on my phone all the time at work, now I just leave it in my office. I’m employed by my Dad so I never got fired and I hid it really well. Leaving my phone in my office has helped me tremendously with being productive and people trust me now because they know I’m not on my phone. I’m not saying this will work for everyone, but it has definitely helped me. Of course, 90% of my time is working in another room besides my office. Niiice. I really wish I had the will power to do this... plus I'm a Mom so I try to keep my phone on me for emergency purposes... and for some reason my coworkers like to text me while they know I"m at work instead of calling the store number... but anyway, I'm glad you can do that and see benefit from it. I have a smart watch that buzzes when I have a notification and gives me a preview of what is going on. I have it set to only notifiy me of certain things. That helps me A LOT because I can keep my phone in my pocket and not constantly check it in the hopes of a text or something. No buzz means no need to check cause nothing is going on lol Similar situation. Actually getting an apple watch helped me keep off my phone -- I get phone call and text notifications, but don't have any other notifications turned on. I can read the text or see who is calling without even touching my phone and if it's not an emergency I don't answer it.

I keep my phone in my backpack most of the time and it really helps! Also simply moving all my media/games/time wasting apps to the very back page helped me from auto-piloting over to FB any time I needed to get on and use my calculator or whatever.. even outside of work.

It's sitting on my desk right now, so thank you for the reminder to put it up!
