different coloured screens/background and font colours etc. to try and help with concentration? I am not dyslexic, but as a teacher was taught how many of them prefer reading with yellow paper/colour overladen the text, and I found some success with this. 

I've tried changing my word background colour to dark yellow and font to black, and have also tried dark blue and white font - interested to hear if anyone else has found success with any other mixes?

I also use the nightlight thing on my phone... all day. So it has a very low overlay of yellow/red hue. Ooooo. I am interested in this. WHY or what is your issue? Eye fatigue with screens is often blink rate (decreased with video) 
I am dyslexic and read SO slow and get eye fatigue.  Never could get open dyslexic font to load of phone or pc (supposedly helps).
 Yeah - Get 'Nocturne' if you have a Mac and just search if you have windows as there are about a bazillion programmes    


Or get a text editor used in programming and change the colour scheme to see what's good for you.   


Green / Red text on a black / dark background is good for me or light grey on dark grey  


I find it a lot less distracting - especially when reading crap online. Thanks, on windows so I'll search for something similar to that! Cheers.  If it's windows 10 you can search 'invert colours' in the search bar and it'll give you a bunch of colour options
