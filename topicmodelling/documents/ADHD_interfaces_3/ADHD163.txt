How do you feel during treatment vs off? Other than academics, did you notice any substantial changes in your life because your symptoms were reduced? Hey guys, after reading the subreddit, I realized that every symptom I have is inline with ADHD Inattentive. My doctor said there is a strong possibility that I do have ADD despite my strong performance in my college classes (Computer Science Major). 

I am wondering if there are any other areas of you life where the treatment helped significantly. I understand most people find treatment very effective, however, I have also found people opposed toward medication and such. Therefore, I was wondering which symptoms have been alleviated/eliminated, and how has it helped you personally?

Here are some of the problems I struggle with daily in case anyone else found that treatment helped alleviate/eliminate the symptom (The first sentence is the symptom followed by my personal feelings from the symptom in case you want to skim through this wall of text):

* I need an hour every morning to collect my thoughts. During this time, I'm very cranky and I do not process what others are saying even though I get 7-10 hours of sleep daily.

* Inability to stay focused in class from start to finish. I cannot concentrate in class at all and I am often so zoned out, I forget to copy the notes on the board.

* I need to maintain a daily schedule of tasks to be completed throughout the day or I procrastinate getting my work done.

* Reading the newspaper or books is extremely difficult because I find myself looking at the words, but not processing them. I usually have to re-read 4-8 times before fully understanding the question or statement. 

* I always get ideas for developing apps and after a few hours of working on them, I never finish coding. I feel like a car with no gas. Although I want to finish developing, I find myself pushing it off.

* Whenever I have a long conversation with someone, I zone out if they spend more than 10 seconds talking. This makes office hours ineffective for me. Professors tend to go on long rants to provide me a solution to the concern I have and there I am thinking about other things. I hate this. I try so hard to focus, and I even say it mentally, "just focus on the professor", but I cannot. No matter how much I try, I'm just so zoned out. 

* Whenever I leave a room to go somewhere else, I zone out immediately, and my body is in autopilot. As a result, when someone I know is walking in my direction, I am so zoned out I do not even notice their presence.

* I have terrible short-term memory. Sometimes I forget to wear my glasses before I head to class. Similarly, whenever I leave to go somewhere, my keys, wallet, watch, headphones, and water bottle are the items I misplace. I always do a five minute check before heading out, and I still misplace things. This is the one that sucks the most because it is really hard for me to remember where I kept something that I recently had in my hand. Then my friends always complain since I hold them up for "losing" my items. 

Have any of these symptoms improved significantly? And how has this translated into your day-to-day life? I'm fortunate to be in a major where my grades are determined by tests composed of brief questions, and projects that take a few weeks to complete. Due to this, I maintain a strict schedule to ensure I complete all assignments; so academically, I'm performing well. Although, I do see the potential for my performance to dip when I eventually have to take more reading intensive courses with longer questions.
 Better memory recall especially in conversation when trying to remember names and facts. Better socially as in not avoiding people because I hate small talk. Better overall mood, tidiness and planning ahead. Also methylphenidate removed all anxiety about things that never happen.  I'm combined type, so not all things would apply... but in general, remembering appointments got better, not losing my ID, or keys... those types of things.

Now less to do with inattentive type, impulse issues like interrupting people and fidgeting got a lot better. I also became a better listener. 

 I'll answer these point by point. I'm a physics grad student, though I also do a lot of programming for my research, and I just started meds a few months ago. 

* I still need the hour of prep time in the morning, though I don't take my meds just after waking up. I hear that some people have success with taking meds right as they wake up, or taking them, then going back to sleep for a short time before they kick in. 

* I never had trouble copying notes because somehow I could just let the information flow right through me and onto the page. Kind of like some weird channeling, except with information. Now, though, I feel like I actually retain information from lectures. Previously, I could leave a lecture and not remember a thing that had been discussed five minutes later. That said, I haven't been to any course lectures since I started on meds, so I haven't had a chance to see how that goes. 

* Procrastination is lessened, though it can (and does) still happen. However, it's less tempting. Also, once I start on a task, I can stick to it, which is nice. And I have more control if I do happen to start procrastinating. That said, I still make lists of things to do; the less taxed my memory is, the better. 

* I had the exact same reading issue, and it got so much better. I feel like I have superpowers now, except those superpowers are "being able to understand text after only one or two readings." I can't wait till the next semester starts, so I can put my newfound "powers" to good use when studying. Finally, I can actually read course textbooks! 

* I have three app ideas bouncing around my head, as well as a bunch of other unfinished creative projects. No changes there, unfortunately. Though I'm more productive in general, thanks to the meds, which helps with this stuff as well. But I've resigned myself to the fact that I'll probably always have some unfinished projects. 

* I zone out a lot less in conversations while the meds are in effect. Still happens, but it's easier to realize that my mind is wandering off and to draw my attention back to the topic at hand. 

* Zoning out and autopilot like you describe happens less often. In general, I notice my surroundings more. I suddenly started noticing all these buildings that had snuck up on my unmedicated self because they'd been under construction while I walked by them every day. 

* Short-term memory in terms of losing stuff is still so-so. I solved the key problem by physically attaching my keys to belt loops in my pants. Wallet and phone are habits I started 10 years ago, though I lose my phone and wallet in my tiny apartment at least once a day. I forget my lunch and glasses all the dang time, though maybe a bit less often, now? I really want to get some of those Tile things, in any case. 

I think that's everything, assuming I didn't miss something. 

My main issue right now is trying to make the best use of my time. I'm on Ritalin IR twice a day, which means that I have about 4+4 useful hours per day. I can still do stuff after the meds wear off, of course, but it becomes a lot more draining, and at that point, I'm back to fighting all the symptoms again. 

But in any case, medication has been extremely helpful to me. I get this feeling of mental clarity when I'm on them, like all my wayward thoughts are suddenly travelling in more or less the same direction. It's not perfect, and I still have difficulties, but it's been an enormous help. 

Anyway, sorry about the giant pile of text, and good luck with finding a way to improve your symptoms! 

 Thank you so much for the reply! This was exactly what I was looking for, and I'm now I more excited to get treatment. Hopefully my symptoms decrease substantially as well.
