I need help. I can't read. I keep trying to read but my brain will get stuck on loop, reading the same sentence over and over again. My college campus is noisy. No matter where I go, there's talking and tapping and people. I try to stay in my dorm to study and then I fall asleep. I can only focus at night when everyone is sleepy but then I fall asleep again. My sleep schedule is getting worse. I'm medicated and I'm trying different ways to organize myself. But I'm just getting farther and farther behind. I'm supposed to read so much for one of my classes. It's a 100-level class and a requirement for me to be in my college's honors program. I worked so hard to get into this program and I feel I'm capable of getting honors but I'm dying here. I'm not an English/humanities major. Why am I being put through this hell? I get so much reading homework. One night I'm told to read the entire story *the Tale of Sinuhe*. The next night I'm told to read *the Iliad* books 1 and 3. The night after that it's books 6 and 9. It's too much for me and I don't want to fail. I'm supposed to be close reading, taking thorough notes on the story. These books have no context so I already have to spend a ton of time figuring out what the hell is going on. I'm scared I'm going to fail. I don't know what to do.

Tldr; My college has high expectations for me but I can barely read 10 pages without feeling frustrated. Depending on the content and if this is available: Audio books. All. Day. Long. 

 When you say you are on meds. Stims? Is it possible you need to up the dosage. Yes, you are being asked to do a lot. But being distracted in a library seems like the meds need to increase.  Could you talk to your school about accommodations?.  We simply can’t read and retain at that level. They’ve intentionally set it up to be hard for a neuro-typical brain.  It’s supposed to be grueling.  You are willing to have your ass kicked, like everyone else. 

You are willing to match your classmates in effort, but this is not what we do.   Oh thanks! That's a great idea. :) I agree that's likely, but it also could be that they're on too high a dosage, which also [decreases performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law). I did get accommodations but only for testing and being allowed to record/use my computer for notes in class. It was difficult to get those and I'm not sure they're going to give me less class work. But maybe I can appeal to get my own quiet space to work in? Part of the issue is that even the library is distracting. This is the only way I can get through stuff. I often joke that I can’t read, and when I get confused looks, explain that I don’t have the skill of sitting and reading. It’s a rare thing for a book to grab me enough to commit to it, but when it does, I’ll blow through it (I finished The Martian in like 2 days). If I am being forced to read as an assignment or some other reason, its game over. I’ll just stare at a wall for a few hours.

Audible subscription has been fantastic. It’s how I *finally* made it through the Harry Potter series, and now I’m almost caught up on The Expanse series. I will often put it on when I’m doing low thought work, like cleaning, getting ready for work in the AM, or during my breaks at work when I go walk.  A friend of my brother used a sinthetic voice to make audio of of some things he had to memorise.
The whole thing was pretty stupid because of reasons, but, depending on the form of the text you have to read you could do the same to make an audio version if you need it.

If it's on printed paper scan it, use an OCR and then sinthetic voice. If you already have digital text skip the OCR. 

For those lectures in which you can you could maybe record audio and replay it to study. **Yerkes–Dodson law**

The Yerkes–Dodson law is an empirical relationship between arousal and performance, originally developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson in 1908. The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases. The process is often illustrated graphically as a bell-shaped curve which increases and then decreases with higher levels of arousal.
