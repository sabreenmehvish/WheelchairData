Trying to study with a US textbook and jfc what asshole writes these Thanks to ADHD coping mechanisms and high processing speed, I'm pretty good at scanning blocks of text and synthesizing info, but holy shit there's so much unnecessary garbage to sift through and I end up losing interest in the subject altogether. Also, the compulsion to illustrate pretty much every single concept ever with an example? WHY.

Sorry for the rant, it's 3am and I tried to bore myself to sleep with some revision and now I'm here raging on reddit into the void.  Man, how do you do it? I stare at a long wall of text and zone out on the second line. Copious examples for illustration are for the neurotypicals who don't flash to an understanding like we can. And sad but true, few textbooks are well written. Being an expert in one's field usually does not include writing talent! I found in most college courses you can just study the illustrations and read the captions and you have most of the material covered. So many text books have a good enough summary at the end of the chapter, that would be all I would read. Most professors test from their notes and slide shows in my experience. Just use the chapter text as a resource for terms and concepts you don't understand. In most cases they hold or italicize the words that matter.
