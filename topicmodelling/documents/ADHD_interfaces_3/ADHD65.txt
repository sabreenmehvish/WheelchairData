Do you guys have a hard time with reading? What methods do you use to help analyze text better? I'm terrible with fiction and analyzing poetry, as well as focusing on what I'm reading and not falling asleep. I also have troubles visualizing and finding plot holes, as well as recognizing symbolism. When I was younger (around 8-9 years old) I was considered one of the best readers for my age, and would constantly read non-fiction, but as I've gotten older reading seems to be more stale and boring. Has anyone else had the same experience?  Bee reader on PC helps a ton Thank you :)
