Question about bookmarks with transparent middle bars to assist reading Does anybody know the name for these? I saw them given out in elementary school to some kids who already had an IEP. They were grey and had a strip down the middle that was transparent and often tinted yellow so that you could place the transparent part over a line of text you want to read. I really want to purchase one because I’ve just been told I have to stop all stimulant medication for three months prior to a medical test. I assume I can find them on Amazon, though if anyone else knows a source please tell me! Thank you.  Reading Guide - if you search Amazon they’ll have a bunch of what you are looking for. Thank you so much!
