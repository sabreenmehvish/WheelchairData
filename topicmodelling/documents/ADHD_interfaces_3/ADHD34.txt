able to read ebook for long on phone compared to larger screens like ipad or PC Do you purchase ebooks but never read past few pages, lose interest and mind wanders around a bad experience you had 10 years ago..

i found this trick.. if i read in my google play books on Samsung S8 i can read for long because less content shows up on screen when you put 100% as text size.. where as in ipad or a pdf in PC, makes me feel like there is too much , it's hard.. so most probably going to open youtube or reddit :D 

try to read your next book on your smartphone .. ditch your kindle/ipad and see if this works for you.. I kinda inferred this from Dr. Russell Blakely speeches in youtube that we need to keep Event - Response - Outcome as close as possible. once we are done reading text in one screen, our interest amplifies as we got the outcome fast (read one page woohoo).  I am different. I find my Kobo works for me really well. I don't get the distraction that comes with being on a phone. I am not tempted to turn to the last page and read the ending like I do with a paper book.

If I am getting distracted either the book is not for me at all or not for me at this time.
I struggle with books as I can get impatient if too slow moving it I can see the formula the author is using. I can’t use an e reader at all because I’ll be on twitter or Reddit after each sentence  Nah I know what you mean.

The screen size makes my eyes tired and it's hard and I have to rest my laptop on its side and read upright.

I have a needs charging Kindle I should grab again...
