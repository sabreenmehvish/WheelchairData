Do you track text with your thumb/fingers while reading books? I get tired from focusing on text if I don't cover up the first line after each sentence with my thumb. I have above 20/20 vision, so it's not a vision problem. My mind tries to process everything at the same time if I don't. I have always been a good reader. Well, not at first, but I used to read a lot. And just generally reading helps. Eventually you'll be able to read without covering the other sentence with your finger. It's like riding a bike with 2 wheels. You start with training wheels. Then you get a good balance(skill) and then you are riding 2 wheels like a pro! Yes! Or a pencil, went to a speed reading camp (Super Camp) when I was lil and they taught us this and a few more tips to make reading faster while maintaining comprehension. I read too fast to track with my finger, but if I'm having a particularly off day I'll need to cover (usually paragraph at a time) what I've already read or I'll get stuck in a re-read loop for a ridiculous amount of time.
