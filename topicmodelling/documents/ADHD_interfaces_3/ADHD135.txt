> Incremental reading is a learning technique that makes it possible to read thousands of articles at the same time without getting lost. Incremental reading begins with importing articles from electronic sources, e.g. the Internet. The student then extracts the most important fragments of individual articles for further review. Extracted fragments are then converted into questions and answers. These in turn become subject to systematic review and repetition that maximizes the long-term recall of the processed texts. The review process is handled by the proven repetition spacing algorithm known as the SuperMemo method. So I can extend my practice of being in the middle of a dozen or more books at once on my Kindle, to thousands of articles - I can't deny that there's some appeal! I'm still trying to take it all in but I'm diving head first into Anki and very excited about it. I wish I had seen the religion a decade ago. I've been trying Anki and Brainscape!  What's your experience been like so far?
