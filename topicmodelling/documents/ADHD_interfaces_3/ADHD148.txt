How do you deal with strong feelings early on in dating? Context: Met a new girl and went on an amazing second date with her last Friday, but the texting has slowed down. I texted her yesterday and she said she's been crazy busy and would hit me up today. She still hasn't texted and I read into things too much, so I can't stop thinking bad thoughts like that I'm about to get ghosted, did something wrong, she doesn't want to see me, etc. I get overexcited about new people and it brings out the obsessive side of my ADHD that distracts me from the rest of my life.

I'm curious about how other ADHD types deal with these strong feelings. It bothers me so much that I get so invested in people I barely know. 1.)  I always focus on letting them come to me. 

2.)  I never text more than twice in a row, if they like me, they'll text eventually. 

3.)  I try to keep busy doing my own stuff in between, so that I have stuff to talk about and distract me.  

4.) I have to constantly remind myself that I don't actually know the person, I just have a big stupid crush on them. 

5.) I stopped caring if I get ghosted.  Are we the same person??? What has happened to me is I’ll end up dating the person and then it will totally fizzle out within a few weeks, and I’ll spend weeks/months/years feeling increasingly uncomfortable and trying to break it off before realising we have nothing in common and there was never really anything there beyond my mad hyperfocus fixation on them in the first place!

Do you find your feelings fizzle out eventually? Have other things going for you/going on in your life and understanding there are few things more unattractive than someone who is desperate and unable to control their emotions/stay emotionally centered. I’m the same way and wish I had advice. Honestly reading this gives me sympathetic anxiety. I get attached very quickly and read into everything. The worst is when I see someone read a text from me but then they don’t respond right away. I know I’m being irrational but I can’t help the thoughts. Know you are not alone and that you probably are over thinking it. Best of luck man! Always double the length of time in between texts if they don’t respond, with a base value of one day. Text one message or invitation each time. 

Text on the first day. No response or unavailable, text on the third day. No response or unavailable, Text on the seventh day. No response or unavailable, Text on the fifteenth day. No response then stop.

If someone’s schedule or availability doesn’t clear up for you in that two week period then they’re just not available *to you*. 

Move on and forget them.

That’s the rule I follow with friends and dates. (Friends I go out to 2 months though) 

Family is obviously exempt. I had a hard time with it when single, it helps to have someone you can talk to about this kind of thing who can help you check yourself   Haha, I never thought my falling in love quick and hard was an ADHD trait but here we are... I just thought I was a crazy bitch. 

I ride em out. You either lose interest quickly or drive them away by declaring love too early, unless they are into it. I told my husband I loved him after like a month of fucking... Not even dating. He didn't say it until we had been official for 6 months. 

I try and resist the urge to do stuff on impulse, or tell them how I feel until they say something first. So hard though.  I am extremely messy. I come on really strong and impulsively. Fortunately this has never backfired but I am really lucky that I've met mostly nice, very compatible and not terrible men. I basically told my current fiance that he made my panties wet on like the second date <_< This happens to me too This is me too omg. I’m so overly emotional anyways but I get being attached easily and overzealous. I think it’s just who we are and we just have to reign it in a little until people actually know us cuz then they understand more. Oh that's easy, I just mess it up like everything else I do in life and then cry. Simple as that. Definitely get what you're going through.  I could have used the advice in this thread in the past. I usually bother them too much and scare them off. Hey, at least then it isn't a problem anymore I guess... Playing hard to get usually works. They'll initiate if they're really interested, and enthusiasm is a must for me anyway. Stoicism. Go to YouTube and look up Coach Corey Wayne, immediately. You can thank me later. This is super solid advice. Thanks for the tip, I'll let things sit and see if she comes around. She broke her word about texting today, so I won't initiate any more conversation :) These are golden I understand that for sure!

My feelings fizzle out once things are broken off. I just hate not knowing how people feel and people who communicate poorly.

Perhaps I'm more bothered because she studies psychology and has been super accepting and awesome about my ADHD from the get go. She has a sister with ADHD and it's rare to find someone who is so cool about it without being dismissive. Yooooo this is a real thing that happens to ADHD brains! I think due to our impulsivity and liking new challenges and situations. We kinda get bored easily...even of people sometimes. I also wonder if it has to do with emotional dysregulation. Not sure about that tho, still learning what that really means but apparently a lot of ADHD people deal with emotional dysregulation so who knows!  Very true. I definitely have a lot going for me outside of dating, I only restarted dating once I felt happier with the rest of my life.

  


I'll continue to exercise self-control. If she does text, great. If she doesn't keep her word, that's a big red flag.

  


Thanks! I'm still searching for that person to check me, but I completely agree. Good tip! You are so lucky! I am the same way.... but seem to scare guys away before any actual commitments can be made.  Good fucking choice my man. Happens to me all the time and it's frustrating but I really stopped caring if this happens. I also learned to love myself more than the person I have a crush on so I can think she's not worth my time. My last major date was similar to your situation except that we were on a further base and it all happened in the course of 4-5 months but she eventually broke up with me. That's when I realized we had nothing in common haha! I guess I know better now! Dude! we’re going through almost the same thing right now... down to the fucking psychology major.

As a general rule with women too they like coming to you. Coming on too strong will turn them off. I always have to remind myself that if it’s meant to be, nothing will stop it *except* me trying to force it.



 Awww that’s nice! Good luck .... 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 It's easier said than done :). Best of luck to you mate. If you’re in college you can try walking into the councilng center  I'm a working adult now, but I've been meaning to look into coaching/counseling for a while. My issue is my crazy schedule, but I'll try and find time for it! Don't have a friend you can call and use as a sounding board? Not really, unfortunately. My best option would be calling my brother. 

I've always moved around a lot and have only been in this city for about two years. I have good friends here, but none of them are close enough to be a sounding board.
