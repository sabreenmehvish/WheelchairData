How to text with a teammate with ADHD? Wondering if you guys can share some tips that have worked for u. Especially when planning for an assignment I love getting texts.  They are easy to ignore and/or immediately forget about.

Everyone communicates differently, but if you want action I don't think texting is going to gain you as much ground as quickly as other types.

Not that it's your responsibility, but since you're asking, people with ADHD tend to respond well to reward systems.  Something that might work is "As soon as we are done we should all go out to celebrate!".  Of course that only has a chance of working if they are social/socially motivated. If they don’t respond after 2 minutes try sending another message. Especially if it’s on something like snapchat that lets you know they’ve seen it. Usually I can see a text message, be about to message back and then start doing something else and forget. If someone texts me again, it reminds me that I need to text them back Thanks for the tip! Just to clarify, does the reward have to be short-term (after immediate tasks) or can it be longer term (delayed for a few weeks when a big assignment is finished)?

May I also ask if u eventually remember text messages and how u remember them?

 Immediate rewards tend to be more effective for people with ADHD.

I may remember texts later or not.  It's a toss up.  Chances are low if I have dismissed the notification.  It depends on their coping mechanisms if they'll remember to reply.
