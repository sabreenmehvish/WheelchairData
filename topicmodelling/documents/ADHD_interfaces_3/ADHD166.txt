I feel like this text from my SO yesterday pretty much sums up what a lot of our interactions have become. [Text](https://i.imgur.com/RpqqJA0.jpg) 

Basically, I’m homeschooling our son and he asked if I could come home a bit early (we do class at my parents’ because they have an extra room we can use, which greatly helps my focus as well as kiddo’s.) Welp one thing led to another (although tbh I didn’t really prioritize the request so that’s on me) and this text was the result. The second sentence is like a knife in the ribs only because I’ve heard so often lately. 

And he’s not wrong, which I can concede in a moment of reflection over 15 hours later. But in the moment the RSD kicks in; and all I can process is feeling 1. attacked and then 2. overwhelming hopelessness.

This is just a rant, I don’t really have any wise conclusion or intelligent question. :/

TLDR: I feel like I’ve had the same conversation about my need to improve a million times and it’s slowly killing my soul. 

 Love I know how you feel. “You need to ...” is all I hear, and when I feel like I’m doing halfway decent at it somehow my past inability to do it comes up, which just starts the self-deprecating spiral. On one hand? I need someone to keep me accountable. On the other? I wish it wasn’t my spouse. Honestly I think it has seriously affected our relationship (and of course I torture myself wondering what it would be like if I didn’t have BPD/ADHD...cause why not?!?). It makes me sad. All the times I’ve hurt him, I’ve flaked on my word...it just makes me *sad*. And the same convo a million times eats my soul away too.  Someone who is short and cannot reach things on high shelves clearly needs to make an effort at improving their height. They could be taller if they’d just try harder...

Things like ladders, or not keeping things on high shelves in the first place, are just an easy way out for people who want to use their height as an excuse.

Sounds ridiculous? It’s just as absurd for someone to say similar things about your ADHD.

There are certain things your brain is not, and never will be, good at, no matter how hard you try. You can work on coping mechanisms and ways to compensate (like ladders or not putting things on high shelves), but having problems with this is not a personal failing any more than your height is, it’s just the body you were born with. Oof tearing up just reading this. You’ve explained it exactly; the arguments I constantly have with myself as well. I think the perfectionist streak I’ve dealt with since childhood (Yay OCD) makes it so much worse-and I would think BPD would have a similar effects bc they both share black and white thinking?

The worst part is, some days I feel like even if I magically straightened everything out tomorrow, it wouldn’t matter because everything is already “ruined” by all the absurd past mistakes. Lol and people used to praise how responsible and smart I was.  That's a really nice way to look at it; thank you so much. I actually am pretty short so the metaphor really resonated with me lol. 

&#x200B; That second half of your post hit me in the gut. It’s *exactly* how I feel. Dead on. Are we BFFs in the future? 😆 [Welp](https://tenor.com/wb9M.gif)
