How do you read? I love reading and read on a regular basis, typically finishing a book every week or so.  Typically, though, these books are fantasy or scifi.  When I attempt to read something more in depth, be it a scientific journal article for work or an interesting article that I found on reddit, I notice that I constantly have to go back and re-read sentences or entire paragraphs because I either forgot what the previous section said or skipped it entirely out of boredom, only to find that it was critical for my understanding.  How do you avoid letting your mind wander or become bored while reading? I'm in the same boat. Love to read, but if involves anything out of my range of interests it's usually a struggle for me to finish. 

One thing though that I was taught is just to annotate the text as you are reading. In case you aren't aware, annotating ("active reading") is just the act of highlighting and/or marking points in the text that you feel is most important/ may need to look back to later/ don't understand completely and then adding notes, summaries, or questions about it in the margin or around the text. This tactic is supposed to keep you focused and increase your comprehension of what you are reading, and also makes it easier to look at the important ideas later on.

If you are unmotivated to annotate texts (I know I usually am- even if it is reading something that's required), you might need to just try taking it paragraph by paragraph and using more mental focus to stay concentrated. 

Hope this helps! Reading is one of the only things I hyper-focus on. I read, retain, and love it. Thats one of the few gifts I have from ADHD. I argue with the text. Ask it questions. Treat it like a blogger I plan to comment on. Before my diagnosis I used to devour books. My then misunderstood hyperfocus period would emerge once I had a good book in my hand. I'd plow through novels in a weekend.Now that I am on meds and seeing someone about coping techniques, etc /// Something has shifted and I find myself unable to get through more than a few paragraphs without my mind drifting or the book becoming heavy and intolerable. Its really bumming me out. Ironically enough I've really started to dive into creative writing yet I find myself being hampered by this growing issue when I try to read up on techniques or other peoples works.

 I so desperately want to read a book, just sit down and get lost in it, but I can't, I can't keep my mind from wandering even while medicated. It's just so exhausting to reread a sentence 7 times or to finish a page only to realize I read words but didn't get any of the story from it. I love reading a lot, but yeah the technical stuff can be difficult.  I learned a couple of coping techniques when I first learned how to read (had some difficulties at first, but neither parent remembered what it was). 


If you have the physical copy, use your finger to follow where you are reading.  If you read faster then that, or are reading for a while (paperburn hurts!), use either one or two note card to block the lower text and the upper text. This is up to your personal preferences.  I only need to block the lower text.  

If you are reading on a computer, highlighting with your mouse, or using your cursor to lead your eyes can be similar. Sometimes its a lot easier to print it out though, because then you can't click off the page when you get bored. 

If you have a hard time retaining, then notes help so so much.  Make an  outline, write out words you don't know or need to know the definition to, figure out the big points to each paragraph. When I take notes, I find that I don't have to re-read as much.


Finally, take breaks. When I get tired I've found that I'll have to re-read things multiple times to even remember if I've read that paragraph.  Drink lots of water, and get up and move.  If I get bored I'll be a lot more restless, and feel the need to wiggle and move.  Getting up and stretching or just getting a new drink ever 15-20 minutes really cuts down on that. Well, it sounds like one of the most classic problems ADHD folks face: they're only absorbed by things that directly interest them.  Boring things get back-burnered in your brain. 

However, life doesn't always allow for that, and so you must find a way to retain the information.

I am studying Physiology and Cell & Molecular Biology.  I'm fascinated by my studies, but there is a lot of dry literature to be read.  To avoid the problem you describe, I have a few tricks.

*  Fidget.  I prefer to fiddle with Silly Putty.
* Take notes with a pen, on paper (not with a computer).  The physical act of writing down what you're reading will help you retain the information.  When you have finished a portion of the reading, go back over your notes and condense them into a more concise set of notes.  This will cement the information in your brain.
*  Keep your place marked on the page with your finger, a pen, a bookmark, or something like that.  Only move forward when you have absorbed the information.
* If you are alone, read out loud, and slowly.  Pause every few minutes to reiterate what you have just read.
 Regadless of what I'm reading, I do best if I have something to block out the next few lines of what I'm reading (a ruler, a bookmark, a piece of paper, etc.) It helps me stay focused on the line and not jump ahead, which I have a habit of doing, and helps me keep my place if I get distracted and look away.

If it's something I need to remember/retain, I actually will mentally repeat the sentences I just read. It's similar to how I took notes in school (teacher would dictate, and I would write the notes, and read them back to myself as I wrote. Aced all the tests. Homework, not so much, lol.)

As far as getting though really dry boring texts quickly with maximum comprehension... I'm really good at skimming. I can just pick out key words in sentences without having to read the whole thing, and get the basic gist of what is being talked about. It's like... mentally highlighting nouns and verbs, and maybe some adjectives and ignoring everything else. I don't.

Haha...well I guess I do a bit.  But never been much of a book reader.  Over the years I've read a handful of books that I've managed to get into.  I haven't read a book more than 10 pages in literally over 4 years now.

Articles and Forums and more my thing.  The shorter the better.  

Sorry, no ideas.  But you aren't alone.  Sometimes I wish I could get into reading more.  Even if it was just so I could easily read longer posts and articles...that'd be cool haha.   Mine depends on the book, but for stuff I really need to retain or study, I always always always read aloud. It helps it stick in my memory more, gives me the memory of reading it and of hearing it.

I do a loooot of "fun" reading too, and I usually "whisper-read" those too, especially if it's a more convoluted book, but I usually try to have a few "easy" ones to read while waiting for the bus or in public so I don't have to sit there talking to myself. Have a book always on hand, but don't worry about reading for long periods of time or if your mind wanders.

I find that when I start reading I can stay more or less engaged for about 10 minutes, modulo some mind wandering. Still, if I have a book by every table, desk, and bed, then I can get in a decent amount of reading per day just in short segments. Have something to fidget with.  I'm not kidding.  I have a stack of buckycubes and when I need to focus on reading, I just play with them as I read.  Fidgeting increases focus.

Even just clicking or twirling a pen works, so long as no one nearby will murder you for doing it. i can read a book in a day(if i am interested in the subject matter) i read voraciously about things that interest me naturally. literature, poetry, history, self-help, spiritual stuff- read tons of it.  if i had to sit down and read anything technical or scientific i believe i would experience physical pain! :)  not really but i for the life of me cannot do it.  if someone told me i "had" to read and study something it was an instant turn off, still would be i guess. i dont avoid letting my mind wander when i read, if it does i lose interest and leave the book for the moment, day, week, forever.  might not help but just thought id throw that out there.  im not a student and my job doesnt require boring reading. :P We're twins!! I love fantasy and sci-fi and can easily devour large books pretty quickly when I'm engrossed in the story, but I also have problems reading scientific papers, which is very problematic, as I'm in a science Master's program. In order to pay attention/not fall asleep while reading them, I have to make it a very involved activity, and I have to read the sections in a special order. Here is the detailed strategy I find most useful when reading scientific journal articles:

1. **I print a physical copy of the paper.** I absolutely *cannot* read articles on the computer without getting distracted, and I usually highlight sentences of interest while I read. However, if you prefer to read papers on your computer screen, there is a WONDERFUL application called **[ReadCube](http://www.readcube.com/?gclid=CNaUvrLUzbgCFSho7AodjVAALg)** that is incredible for organizing papers, and it also lets you highlight and write notes in the PDF without it looking like disorganized chickenscratch. I also tend to go to a coffee shop or a library where I can have a sizeable, clean workspace and minimal distractions. I find that it's also difficult for me to read while I'm listening to music, so I turn that off too (but sometimes I keep my headphones on to dampen outside noise/keep people from bothering me). 
2. **I read the title and abstract.** This prepares me for what I am about to read, and gives a general overview of the background, results, and the significance of their findings. After reading this part, I use a designated notebook to write down two or three sentences summarizing the content of the article. Think of it as an "abstract of the abstract." I also make sure I write down the authors, title, and year for my own information later.
3. **Generally, after summarizing, I am left with a couple questions I want answered in the article** (or maybe you're reading this for an assignment and know what questions you need answered). I write these down underneath the summary with a line or two in between for answers.
4. **Then I look at the figures.** I try to get as much information as I can out of them, then if I get too confused, I move on and refer to them again later. I record any specific questions I have for later reference.
5. **I read the Introduction, highlighting important information and/or references I want to check out later.** If I am familiar with the subject matter, I will skim this section briefly to prevent myself from getting too bored. I write down any questions I have in my notebook.
6. **I read the Discussion and summarize the findings in my notebook.** This is my favorite part of the paper, because it generally gives a great overview of the Results along with a more detailed interpretation and broader impacts. If I don't need a deep understanding of the paper, I generally stop here. If I do need a deep understanding, I continue to the next step.
7. **I look back at the figures.** This is usually a lot easier the second time around, especially after reading the Discussion. If I'm having a lot of trouble understanding what the figures are showing me, I will refer back to the Methods, Results, and Discussion for more information. If I'm feeling especially industrious, I try to draw simplified versions of the figures with my own short descriptions in my notebook.
8. **I read the Results section, highlighting anything I find interesting or useful, and marking references to figures.**
9. **I go back and see if I can answer all the questions I asked myself in a brief sentence.** If not, I try to find a reference that will help me answer those questions.

Anyway, that's the way I have to do it. Whether you follow that process or develop your own system, I think the key is to make sure you're engaged in the reading process, and not just trying to get to the end of the article. You're not going to get any useful information out of it by doing that. Also, if the steps I've listed sound daunting to you, it actually only takes me about an hour and a half to get through an article while using this method, whereas I have to read an article over and over for about 4-5 hours when I'm not actively taking notes (and even then I don't really remember what I read). And as an added bonus, I end up with a short record of the paper and my thought process while reading it which is generally easier to read than the paper itself.

Good luck!!

**TL;DR - Read the sections of a scientific paper out of order, highlight interesting information, summarize important paragraphs, and record questions you have in a separate notebook as you read.**
 That's really cool, I'm jealous of you. Writing code is about the only thing I'm able to hyper focus on that is actually productive.  Other than that, I can only hyper focus on playing games and talking way too much in conversations. I feel the same way, I don't know who I would be without my hyperfocus love of reading. It's almost a setback in getting treated by therapists though (for anxiety at the moment), because as soon as they hear I have no trouble focusing on reading a book, they start to not believe I really have ADHD. 

It's incredibly frustrating as I've been diagnosed by two separate psychologists, but being able to read a book is apparently what therapists who don't specialize in ADHD use to determine if I have ADHD or not.  That retention bit... Great for class. Sucks for pleasure... About to start adding date cards to my books as to when I finish, as less that like 2 years, and with in 15 pages the entire story comes back. Like small details... I used to argue with my exam questions in college. I thought they could have been articulated so much more clearly.  Some of my professors even used my suggestions to revise their exam questions for the following semesters.

Active reading is critical to keeping me engaged in a book, be it academic or leisure. I keep a small notepad and write down unfamiliar words or phrases that strike me as particularly well-written. Can you designate a certain period of time each day to reading?  Or a few short periods?  If you maybe only give yourself 10 or 15 minutes to read something, you might find it easier to do.   Hey, out of curiosity, have you ever tried audiobooks?  If you're a person who has to commute long distances or you ride public transit often, this might be a good solution for you. I have an Audible subscription and listen to my books pretty frequently.  I crawl out of my skin with boredom when I have to drive long distances, and not even music makes it better.  Audiobooks keep me totally occupied, though.  Silly Putty.  I keep eggs of Silly Putty everywhere.  (I basically just confiscate it from my children whenever they get it as party favors or whatever.  I'm so mean, I know...)  It gives me something to diddle around with while I'm working or trying to concentrate on something, and it keeps them from grinding it into the carpet, so everybody wins.   I hyper focus on competitive debate. Which requires a lot of evidence and reading. But i just can't seem to read books....

Except for two:

The first is Flannery O'Connor's collection of short stories. Actually, while I'm at it: protip: read short stories. Specific to Flannery, Her depth and detail is bar none, and though it is a different time, I can imagine all of her characters and their situations quite well. 

A second book that I a enjoy is Childrens Hospital by Chris Adrian, because each chapter is different, whether literal or mystical. Dialog, poetry, lyric, or prose. They also seem to be pretty short (I'm still starting that) so like, there's that I guess.

But debate man. I just can't stop. I'm glad I'm not the only one who has done this.  I have taken so many exams that were just covered with my little love notes by the time I turned them in.  "This was ambiguously phrased."  "Both B & C are technically correct, although B is more correct, see Chapter 12 of text."  "Bcl-2 and C-myc are both promoters of tumerigenesis, but BCL-2 doesn't technically promote cell proliferation."

I think they hate me. I can be so pedantic. Anthony Weiner?  I had no idea you were ADHD! ;)
 I did give an audiobook a quick try, I found myself trying to multitask. If I did commute that would probably be a good idea. Perhaps if I listened to it on tape while I read along. Hm.  Interesting idea.  Very meta.  I dunno... I've used audiobooks on a variety of occasions with pretty good success.  I like listening to them at the gym because I find cardio absolutely intolerable.  I listen to them on headphones while I clean my house from top to bottom.  I like them playing in the background while I do crafts or crochet.  It's like listening to talk radio.  You pay attention just enough to get the story, but you don't have to be glued to every word.  >You pay attention just enough to get the story, but you don't have to be glued to every word.  

Interesting way to put it, I'll have to give it another shot.
