Can I get some personal anecdotes from adults with ADHD? **Wall of Text**


So let me start by saying I might be about to commit a major reddit faux pas. Let me apologize in advance! I really tried to make this concise.                





I am here because I have the nagging suspicion that I have adult ADHD. I know! Step one: get diagnosed. Unfortunately, since I’m not on suicide watch, the first available appointment is in a MONTH.     



I am in my early 20s and currently enrolled in a very competitive professional school program. Most of the information I have found would lead me to believe that ADHD is not a possibility for the fact that I have made it this far in my career. (Though I got through my academic career procrastinating/cramming/and with copious amounts of redbull).    



 **The short version of my long question is this!:**  


*-Are there any adult ADHD sufferers out there than can give some personal insight into their diagnosis? (background/behaviors/etc.)* 



*-Specifically, are there any ADHD redditors out there who made it pretty far in academia before realizing they had a problem?*    



I guess I’m just trying to justify my suspicions and get some personal anecdotes to compare to the information I have read online. Absolutely everyone I have tried to discuss this with says that it is impossible for me to have ADHD, I’m just lazy and don’t know how to study. (Which is possible I suppose!)       

        

**Any personal stories or insight would be wonderful!** 




[..CUTENESS for those that made it this far, sort of relevant since I should be studying anatomy..](http://cheezburger.com/7168466944)

Edit: because, what's formatting? Argh. 

                   
Edit 2: I just wanted to formally thank everyone for your input and sharing your experiences! Hopefully I will get some answers soon, but in the mean time, thank you all for your help! I can't give a long story (procrastinating from working right now, how about that?) but I was diagnosed in my 20s after a couple years of grad school. The diagnosis took some time as they went through my history to cover the "how could someone get this far with it" and a bunch of tests. The long and the short of it was a lot like your story.
 I made it to the final year of my honours degree in mathematics before I even realised and got diagnosed, I'd consider that pretty far. Fortunately, you don't have to be a failure to have ADHD, so don't let your success deter you from the possibility.

Before I found out I always thought I was a weird kind of lazy compared to my "equally lazy" friends. I would "forget" homework, mess around in lessons, rush homework last minute, not study.. etc...  I shared all the classic lazy person traits.. except one.  All the lazy people I knew just... didn't care where as my passion for learning was matched only by my hardworking/braniac friends. To me the idea of not even bothering to learn was blasphemy, yet I would do it all the time.

It's funny looking back at how peculiar I thought it was that I cared so much, yet did as little as people who didn't care at all....  I even had a friend who I would sometimes comment on being "exactly the same as me, the only difference between us is he has ADHD and I don't"! It was so blindingly obvious! Yet I just could not for the life of me see it!

**PS:** Sometimes I would try to conquer my daydreaming habits, I would sit there thinking to myself "alright, focus on the lesson, focus.. focus...... wait, where did all this stuff on the board come from? what did I miss?"

 I actually get distracted from the lesson by thinking about focusing on the lesson... How's that for an anecdote? I was 30 when I was diagnosed (32 now) and had just gone back to college after transferring my units to my university, so I guess you could say I got pretty far before I was diagnosed.  

I finally went in for diagnosis (I had suspected for quite a while) because university classes were much more demanding than community college classes, and I was struggling. And I felt like I was struggling more than I should be, so I went through the diagnosis and came out with an Adderall prescription and a big task ahead of me.  Managing ADHD turned out to be much more than just popping pills and suddenly being motivated and successful.  

The reason I wasn't diagnosed in high school was because I managed to skate by on smarts alone somehow, keeping my grades decent.  For the life of me, I can't regurgitate a damn thing I learned, though. 

Anyway, yeah, bad grades and failure in school aren't requisite for an ADHD diagnosis.  You can do alright, but if you're diagnosed, you can do much better. Good luck! Do you do better in situations with an external structure?
Are you amazingly focused, bordering on obsessive, on certain things, but jumping out of your skin when faced with certain tasks which should be simple?
Do you have a bad traffic record? Accidents, fender benders, traffic tickets, parking tickets?
Do you sometime feel very angry or frustrated with yourself because you haven't achieved commensurate with your abilities?
Do you start writing a text or email, and then hours later, find that you have yet to finish it?
Do you have piles of unsorted paperwork accumulating about your home or office? 
Are you erratic with your bill payments?
Are you chronically late because at the ideal time of departure, you fly around doing just one more thing?
Do you seem to lose your keys, wallet/purse, or cell phone more than most people?

 [deleted] Since I'm normally a lurker, I apologize for any Reddit faux pas in advance.  I was diagnosed in my mid 50s, though I was diagnosed with dyslexia in my teens (they called it something different in those days).  By the time I was diagnosed I'd had a nursing degree and several bachelor's degrees.  No graduate degrees--I just couldn't seem to stick to a subject long enough.  My grades were mostly high A.  I'd gone for years undiagnosed mostly because I, too, thought I could not be ADD or ADHD if I'd succeeded academically--as did most of the doctors I consulted.  There was a previous thread regarding the effect of high IQ on ADD/ADHD and diagnosis that could perhaps explain those of us who succeed academically despite ADD/ADHD. I am just one math credit away from a B.A. in Communications.  Unfortunately, I'm 34 and haven't been to college in over 10 years. I was 3 years into my PhD when I was diagnosed. If you look back through the subreddit, there was a post a few days ago about people with high IQ's being diagnosed after successfully getting through lots of academic or career hoops. I wasn't diagnosed until after I finished an undergraduate degree. I was doing post-bac work on pre-reqs for professional school. I had been seeing a psychiatrist for depression, and it seemed like out of nowhere he said I had ADHD. I didn't believe it at first but it fits. Meds helped me get through my first year of professional school. I didn't go through lots of formal in-depth testing (shit's expensive even with insurance!) so I don't get accommodations from the school but frankly I don't think I need them. I went off meds this summer and haven't needed them so far this year.  I finished my bachelor's before I even knew I had ADHD.  Fortunately I enjoyed school (although I procrastinated a lot). I knew I had a major problem when I couldn't hold onto a job.  I wasn't diagnosed until 2 years into college, I never studied in high school and graduated 5th in my class, I got to college and tried not studying, but it didn't work very well, I still would wait until the last minute to do everything, and my grades always stayed around a 3.0 (the minimum GPA I needed to keep my scholarship) I fell below that 3.0 a few times and ended up on academic probation but always managed to bring it back up. 

I've always had trouble focusing, but I didn't realize how bad it was until I spent 2 years honestly trying as hard as I could to pay attention in class and to read more than 5 pages of a textbook at a time. For a while I kept telling myself the same thing, I couldn't have ADHD, I did so well in school, and I'm still doing well, I just don't have any self-discipline, I'm lazy, I'm not studying correctly (to be honest I really didn't know how to study when I started college, but after a year or two I learned the best way for me to learn things, and I figured that out before diagnosis). I told a friend of mine who was diagnosed with ADHD in grade school about all the problems I had with studying and paying attention in class and everything, and she would tell me that I probably do have ADHD, and that I've always had the symptoms.

It took several months before I decided I might really have ADHD, and several months after that before I worked up the courage to set up an appointment (after previous experiences with doctors accusing me of being a drug seeker for another condition I have, I was afraid to ask for stimulants as a college student.) I ended up with a great psychiatrist though, she prescribed me adderall, and it has helped so much more than I thought possible. I remember the first night I took it I sat down and read nearly 50 pages of a textbook in one sitting, before then I'd be lucky if I made it through 5 before English stopped making sense and I ended up rereading the same thing over and over again until I gave up.

So in short, yes your situation is entirely possible, it happened to me. And maybe you are lazy, I know I sure am, I put things off, I procrastinate, but I also know its so much harder to start studying for an exam or do your homework when you know you're not going to be able to concentrate on it for more than 5 minutes, and that getting medication that makes it possible for you to focus will help a lot. Unfortunately you still have to get the motivation yourself for the most part.  I didn't make it far without being diagnosed, but I made it to university, with only a short time (a few months) taking medication in my teens.

I would like to take it again now, but that is another story.

Basically I made it this far by not doing much but compensating with a relatively high IQ. For example my grades were so bad that I had to do a special test to get to the next higher school. (2 year school to get the degree that is needed for admission to the university)

Under 1/3 of students who take that test pass and those who do usually study months for it. I studied a whole afternoon.  \^\^" [removed] I'll commit my own Reddit faux pas and answer a question that doesn't really apply - but I think I do have some insight. Two parts:

1. I was diagnosed in early elementary school before the ADHD "boom," but with some difficulty due to my high IQ and standardized test scores. I have always loved school and (perversely) even standardized testing, so I got good grades and did very well on both school and psychiatric testing. However, one astute psychiatrist noticed that while the majority of my scores were in the high 90th percentile, my concentration scores were average. 

2. I was fairly highly medicated until I went to college, and due to a number of reasons (trouble with dosage, experimenting with new drugs that made me very sick - curse you Strattera, strained self-image and family relations) I chose to stop taking the drugs. I graduated with honors and a 3.8 GPA - though my dorm/apartment was always a disaster and I lost one best friend and roommate due to my extreme "tunnel vision" (she thought I was constantly ignoring her and things festered).

I have been successful as an adult pursuing jobs in the food and hospitality sector, which is fast paced, active, and fun. I had actually hoped I had outgrown my ADHD (sigh), but in the last several months it occurred to me that my extreme anxiety over not being able to keep up on housework and my depression (I never FEEL depressed, but some months I just can't get out of bed until I have to rush to my night job) may actually be a manifestation of it, and since going back on Ritalin I feel like I am finally in control of my life. It feels like a new, adult diagnosis.

Clearly the Ritalin is kicking in, so in sum: yes, it is possible to have a successful academic career and untreated ADHD, particularly if you love what you are studying. It is possible to compensate intellectually for deficits in attention. And it is possible to have your ADHD manifest primarily outside of academics, again, especially if you love what you are studying. 

ETA: /u/floomby's list is great.  On my phone now, will edit this when I get to my comp. Need my coffee (and Vyvanse) first.

**Edit**: Okay, at my computer. I prefer typing on the keyboard. This is gonna be long, so I'll bold out the bits I think are most important!

First thing, I'll say this about my life, it'll explain why my school-life is so odd: my dad moves around a *lot*. We moved to Singapore when I was 6, then to Saudi Arabia when I was 14, then to Switzerland when I was 17, and finally to the USA when I was 22. ^^maybe ^^I ^^should ^^draw ^^a ^^timeline

I didn't speak English when we moved to Singapore, which is what was taught in schools, but was fluently talking within 6 months or so, and reading without a problem by the beginning of 3rd grade, and ahead of the class by fourth. I loved to read (still do!) so it's be that. I don't really remember if I had any hyperactive tendencies when I was a kid, but I do know I would go to great lengths to make sure people are pleased with me, so it could have been sheer force of maladaptive will. I picked up on things quickly, so I got something within one or two explanations. This is when **ADHD starts coming into play**. I could not pay attention. At all. Okay, I got this bit of info I'm supposed to know, but you're explaining if for the 5th time because the joker there doesn't get it. I also had an imagination, so I'd start playing with my stationary and stuff. It got me into so much trouble, and I kept getting yelled at to pay attention (I still maintain that this is a stupid thing, I mean, I got your shit, and I'm not being disruptive, leave me alone). I also **constantly forgot** to do my homework, and while this got me in trouble, it didn't affect my grades as much because most/all of the grades come from exams. But yeah, up until I was 14, I was surviving - hell, *thriving* grades-wise - in school **purely by what I was absorbing in class**.

We then moved to Saudi Arabia. I knew some Arabic (I think of it as my mother tongue, because it is, but not my first language, because I'm shit when it comes to reading and writing), but not enough to get by in public schools. So I was enrolled in an international school which prepared students for the IGCSEs, with 1 Arabic class three times a week. The teachers didn't know jack in that school. I was getting by in tests with what I learned in the past. My grades got worse, but it was something from mostly A's to mostly B's. No big. Just moved half-way across the world, and so on. But I hated the school and begged the parents to move me to the other school (there were two major mainly English schools at the time, I think there are more now). The other school was way bigger, and gave the option of doing a more UK-based curriculum (preparing to take the IGCSEs) or US (prepping for the SATs and SAT II). I went with the US curriculum because why not, already had a bad experience with the IGCSE jokers. This school was crap too, and the teachers seriously didn't know what they were doing. The English literature teacher spent most of the class sniffing markers, and the pre-calculus/calculus/random math teacher didn't know how to factorize an equation. Most of the other students had after school tutors. I told my parents about this, but they maintained that school is enough to learn what needed to be learned. And since I was learning most stuff at the time from class, I wasn't learning at all. I did fine in English (reading helps) and math (Asian education, yo), but everything else? I think I never got anything higher than a C, because **I couldn't study on my own, and not for a lack of trying**. My mood was fucking low, too, I was being treated like utter shit (sure, teachers yelled at me before, but they acknowledged what I'm capable of), and I nearly died twice in the school because I got a hypoglycemia in class and the admin neglected to inform the teachers that one of their students is diabetic, and thought I was being a lazy good-for-nothing teen and was asleep in class (yeah, I forgot to mention that, I was diagnosed when I was 8). At this point it's been established that I can get good grades, so everyone thought I was lazy, or moody, or being a rebellious teen.

I registered to take the SATs in 10th grade, totally ignoring the snide remarks from teachers about how a 'tard won't be able to do anything, but you should have seen the looks on their faces when I got 1560 (this was back when it was out of 1600). I had to put up with 1 more year of this bullshit before we moved to Switzerland, and enrolled in an international school close to Geneva.

So, 12th grade, back to a school where the teachers knew wtf they were doing, and I went back to **doing well enough through listening in class**. Most of the homework was more **projects and research based** now, and I found I *could* do that, because it wasn't boring me, and **didn't require me to pay attention to one thing (like a text book) for a long period of time**. So back to A's and B's.

Then I started university, also in Switzerland. I got told right from the beginning, for every hour in class, I'm gonna be studying for two at home, at a minimum. I couldn't do it. I'd read half a chapter and realize I didn't get any of it. I got bored too easily, I got side tracked too easily. I graduated with a GPA of 2.4 (I believe). I took some time off after I got my BA, because I was seriously burned out. I also had hard-core depression (which didn't help in any way, let me tell you). Turns out not having a stable home or social life for most of your life has a detrimental effect on you, whodathunk (certainly not my parents).

I was also always arguing with my mom because of how "messy" (read: disorganized) I was. Again, always **attributed to being lazy.** Same with never finishing, or having a really hard time finishing, what I started. 

I went to a psychiatrist for my depression, and after listening to me, prescribed me some antidepressants, and a side of Xanax to be used as needed. I got a bit better, like, not-staying-in-bed-all-day better, but it was still bad. I moved away to start grad school to where my sister was at. I saw a different psychiatrist there, because I'm gonna need my prescriptions refilled and stuff, and some of the stuff I said must have raised some red flags for her, because she gave me this long list of statements rated on a 5-point scale to answer. What do you know, I have all the **inattentive symptoms, to varying degrees, a lot of which can be attributed to depression** as well, which wasn't picked up on earlier because I **wasn't hyperactive, and I was getting good grades**. She gave me a prescription for Vyvanse, to see if that made a difference.

Difference was an understatement. A lot of my depressive symptoms got better (still there, but def not as bad), and I found it so much **easier to study and focus on tasks at hand**. My GPA was hovering at 3.9. Organization and keeping up with the crap life needs you to do became easier as well. 

But! One thing I *have to note*, it's not a magic pill. If you're not motivated to do anything, you're not gonna do anything. It just helps with the stuff that's holding you back, but it's not going to miraculously get you to do stuff. 

Like procrastination.

Which I'm doing.

I should be studying. First, thanks for posting this. I am in a similar boat - suspect I have it, but not yet diagnosed. 

Second, thanks to everyone else who posted so many of the stories sound so similar to my experiences. 

Edited to add the rest of my comment.  Diagnosed at 26 after 2 successfully completed bachellors degrees, three years of successful career, and midway through another diploma while working 50-60 hours a week. Everything I did took 3-4 times as many hours of work as my peers. I didn't sleep much and had no time for a personal life.  I recently got diagnosed in the severe range. I'm 22 and I may not have done as well as it sounds like you're doing but I definitely haven't been eating shit my whole life either. Never could keep a job longer than a month or two, I can rattle off historical facts like its my day job but never did well in anything outside of history academically, my room (until this week) has always been totally trashed, would forget really important stuff ALL THE TIME, ended up doing pretty much any paper the night before it was due throughout all of high school even finals, you know the usual. I still have lived a fulfilling and exciting life all things considered. Diagnosed at 51.  Doing fine. You already have a wealth of responses here, but I might as well thrown mine in too. In my early 20s, went to a very good undergrad. Diagnosed within the past year, now in a prestigiousgrad program. Still working through depression and anxiety, likely comorbidities of the condition but I'm not sure. My ADD meds make me anxious, so I haven't taken them per regimen since last week, but I'm working on trying to get acclimated to them. But not everybody responds like that. 

Basically, I'm still working all this shit out. But it doesn't mean that you won't get through your program. My understanding of my condition is that, because I was pretty smart, I found workarounds for my entire life that allowed me to succeed and do pretty well. I was never top-honors or Mr. valedictorian, but I was smart and most teachers/professors could tell that. People told me I was lazy, unmotivated, had bad habits, should be doing better, etc. It's possible that taht's the case - as deterministic as modern psychology and psychiatry can be, ultimately, different doctors can give you different diagnoses. It's the unfortunate truth. For instance, my current therapist was one of a few that I checked out when I decided to see one, and she was the only one who gave credo to the idea that I might have ADD  - the rest of them basically said some iteration of what you have been told. 

My therapist clarified this for me in a way that I think's useful, and been echoed throughout this run of comments. Basically, people who have ADD and are really smart may find that they can work in different ways to reach the things expected of them. It won't hit them, or others, that they have ADD until the very moment when they cannot have things work in their favor. For instance, I had a miserable time writing my BA thesis and ultimately turned something in that neither I nor my advisor was particularly proud of. But, I made it work for me. I threw together a set of conclusions, made some ad hoc judgments about my data, and wrote something that I hated. And I passed! I've been doing this my whole life, and now that I'm in grad school, I'm still doing it quite a bit. 

I can't diagnose things for you, but I would implore you to look at your past. Does your mind wander, even when you don't want it to? Do you have thought sequences that other people seem not to have? In the past, have you had tremendous difficulty focusing? That's what happened with me, and I just thought I was severely depressed and anxious for a while. But, antidepressants and anxiety meds never seemed to work as well as I'd like. 

I started seeing a therapist because I was almost fired from two part-time jobs, both of which I ended up leaving because of the terrible job I was doing and awful impression I left on my bosses (being under the gun and threatened with firings is never a sign of a positive work environment for people with ADD). Unfortunately, it can be hard to get disability provisions or even sympathy from employers about this stuff, but it's definitely possible. 

Since you're in professional school, you'll hopefully go places in your career that will allow you to have some leverage - not being someone's peon, having people working under you to whom you can delegate those tasks that seem to escape you, etc. That's what I'm hoping for my career, at least.

Either way, see a professional and try to get some answers. I hope these things work out for you. A massive intellect and self-awareness about it (as well as whatever conditions affect it) are two of the biggest burdens a young person can have, but use them right and they'll be two of the biggest tools to improve your life! 

 I did not receive a diagnosis of ADHD until my second year of a top 20 American law school.  I have a few phenomenon that you, or others, might relate with.

The Re-Read: I have always loved reading, but reading without medication is more dull and laborious.  Typically when reading for fun, I could often only get through a few pages before my mind would begin actively thinking of other things.  While I am thinking about other things, another part of my brain continues reading.  As a result, when I "check back in," I realize I haven't retained anything in the last page or two. 

The Space and Guess: This one was such a pain.  Very similar to the Re-Read, the Space and Guess prevents me from paying attention to almost anyone in a social setting.  Many times, paying attention was important.  I was in a business meeting, talking to a friend, or a pretty girl.  Soon however, I'll be thinking about other things and I'll be forced to pretend I know what they just said with cleverly placed nods and "mhms."
 
Pathological Busyness: This is true even now.  I have always been completely utterly busy doing things.  Often the things I do are rather eclectic.  This could be a symptom of ADHD because having so many responsibilities means I am pulsing with adrenaline/anxiety so I won't procrastinate nearly as bad. 

Impulse Control: I'm sure this is a common one.  Basically, I always wanted to be a comedian or an active member of whatever group I was with.  Really, it was just me getting temporarily carried away in most situations and briefly convincing myself I am the rightful center of attention.

Option Confusion: Often when things happened that needed immediate response, I would be paralyzed by brief considerations of the many options I could undertake.  Each option takes time to consider and if I were to consider it, I couldn't consider much else at that time.  I was often left looking like a bumbling idiot in volatile situations. 

Some success is not a good indicator of whether you should look into a diagnosis.  Although some of the things I did were very successful, looking back, it is easy to see the signs everywhere.  Before the diagnosis, however, we just didn't know to look at them.  I earned my diagnosis at age 40 and am now 42.  With undiagnosed ADHD, I still managed to complete advanced degrees and hold down a job as a college professor. I've worked at the same university and have steadily advanced since I landed my first teaching job here at age 25.
I managed to not complete two different PhD's along the way and build up a ton of debt too. I read constantly and write sporadically. I forget and avoid important things daily. I'm getting better.

You can read my blog for approximately 378 more anecdotes. Hopefully, most of them are good.  http://attentiondeficitwhatever.com/  I have ADHD. I also have my MBA. I do not currently take medicine and I funtion fairly normal.  A lot of it tends to come from the way I learned to compartmentalize and focus. That being said I try to live in the moment.  The more I can be interested in something the more I can focus.  Caffeine helps stabilize me but sugar takes focus away.  I find to study I needed to wear headphones and listen to music that is up tempo.  Techno is best. Words can distract me [deleted] Thanks for taking the time to reply! Really I do appreciate it! Thank you for the comment, these are the kinds of things I was hoping to hear about! 

I graduated college with honors.. somehow.. I have always been a good student without really trying. I totally agree with the 'weird kind of lazy,'  it really isn't that I don't care. I am having a meltdown lately because I know that I'm not learning to my full potential, and I'm bombing my coursework. I stumbled upon the symptoms of ADHD while looking up study tips- after realizing that I have none! I sit down to do work on a daily basis and end up staring at the wall for hours upon hours. I WANT to be productive! I also really want to believe that I am not this terribly lazy. *sigh*  This is really late but I think you've convinced me to seek actual medical advice. What you said about being passionate about learning but not actually working is a perfect description of me!! I'm typical "lazy" except I actually like school and learning and what-not. Yet I do everything you said you did (late assignments, etc) and hate myself after wondering why the hell I do it.

Thanks Thank you! That's the vibe I'm getting now. College was a breeze, but professional school is a swift kick. I feel like I'm floundering with the work, and not because it is difficult per se, but because I just can't keep on top of it. I know that a prescription won't magically make my work get done, but it would be such a relief to know that laziness isn't my problem. (Or maybe it is!) Thank you so much for the input! I'm not sure if these are meant to be thought provoking or answered, so I'm going to answer them for my sanity, ha.              


*I deal much better when things are structured for me. I struggle with studying because there is no one to force me to do it. 



*I am obsessive about cleaning, which is kind of odd. From past experience I know that once I let things pile up I will be back to my childhood when my room was such a mess I couldn't get my door opened. Also I focus very well when I am working: it is usually physical, demanding, and I have a list set of objectives to accomplish to keep me on task. I find studying most daunting of all things, it requires me to sit down and create my own schedule and stick to it, never possible. No matter the assignment, I will be up to midnight doing it - every. single. time.



*My driving record isn't terrible, but it is a running joke with my SO that I have WAY more cop interactions than he ever has. I usually get off lightly due to pure panic and tears. I have wrecked my car 2-3 times, and been pulled over for speeding at least 2-3 times a year.



*I'm always frustrated with myself - I care about my performance in school but I always cram. With professional school, it impossible to cram that amount of material, and my grades reflect that proportionally. 




*I do this all the time. Fall asleep texting, forget to reply, see it days later and vaguely remember having read it previously. 



*My binder in highschool was a class joke. I had one, but I just stuck EVERYTHING in the pocket. When you picked it up, 4 inches of paper would spill out to the floor. I don't even know what to do with paperwork! I force myself to file/trash things more regularly now, but I can never keep up with it.



*Bills.. I make sure I have the money.. I never remember to pay them. I always let my roommates put things in their name because it would murder my credit. 



*I am late every single day of my life. Give me five minutes or five hours and I will arrive at the same time. My sister literally said today: 'I would never call you lazy.. but you do tend to procrastinate and put everything off til the last minute and you're always late.' I asked a friend if I have ever been on time for anything, her response: The older we get, the later you get.



*I lose everything that isn't attached to me. I have a huge set of keys so that everything is in one place, and I can find/lose it all at once. I get about 3 new debit cards a year. I've locked my only key in my car twice in less than 6 months. And I 'misplace' important things on such a regular basis that its almost comical.. almost.  I thought I had replied to you but... So anyway, thanks so much for sharing! This was extremely helpful. I have decided to be a little more pushy in my course of action because in a month, I may not need help in school. (As in I may have failed out by then!) 

Parts of your story are very familiar. As for the parking brake analogy, I've done that for real more times than I can count, haha. I'm currently trying to crank up my panic mode so I can get something done. Exam tomorrow - I've done five minutes worth of studying and 20 hours worth of daydreaming and procrastinating! Thanks again for the input! Thank you for coming out of the shadows to share! It's never too late!
 You can always finish it online (maybe!) Wow! What made you look into diagnosis, if you don't mind me asking. And thanks for the recommendation, sorry if my post seems redundant. Thank you! Thanks for sharing! Do you mind me asking if you are male/female? The internet seems to think that more females go undiagnosed until later, so I'm just curious. Also, the expense! I know what you mean! I'm not sure how else to go about it because I don't have insurance. I'm going to do the consult through the college and see how that goes. I don't have the money to waste but at this point, I have to know! That's awesome that you've been able to go off your meds and maintain your work, any insight into how that worked for you? If you don't mind me asking, what sort of job do you have? I know very one is different, but my work involved 10 hours of physical activity, and I felt like I thrived on that - much more so than studying! Thanks for the input! Definitely! I have the motivation to begin things. It's just that after about five minutes of getting no where, that motvaion is extinguished. Thanks so much for sharing! Wow! I've definitely had experiences like that. Where I put in my version of effort and exceed my peers - but it would appear those days are over for me. Thanks for sharing! Thanks so much for sharing! I'm sorry that your issues are resurfacing, but at least you have something I help keep them in check! And thanks for not ripping me apart for poor reddiquite :P Regarding 1: Standardized tests are great (not great for students to actually learn anything, but great in the sense that they are easy). Sadly we basically don't have them in germany.

Also sadly not only test scores and how you answer in class count into the grades, but also how well you keep your notes and how you do your homework and all that stuff. Which also means that teachers have a lot of freedom on how your final grade is. It can be a lot worse than your test scores. That was always the case for me. Thanks SO much for sharing! This was very helpful! Thanks for the input! haha late reply back at you, I'm glad I could help! It's difficult to realise on your own as your mind is the only one you've lived with, to you it's the norm. I only realised because a friend asked me if I had it which raised my suspicion, otherwise I would've carried on unaware. Anyway I hope it all goes well.

PS: The first doctor I got didn't care enough to listen properly, he just wanted me out of the room. It's hard not to want to go into a story but... point being don't be put off if the first guy dismisses you without a proper trial. (I went with a parent the 2nd time as well as a small questionnaire I had a long time friend fill in, it went smooth as silk) I think all of us are just a *liiiiittle* lazy, ADHD or not.  Everyone could be more productive, more thorough, and waste less time.  But ADHD makes this much worse.  When you feel like you desperately need to, and you try, and you sit down and stare at a page to study, but you just can't?  Like, your mind is just flitting back and forth like a gnat that you just can't catch?  That's the ADHD feeling. And it's, well, pretty much all the time.  Except when you find something that really interests you, and then you can focus for hours.  In fact, you can hyperfocus, and it's usually to the detriment of things you should actually be doing.   Just want to say that I literally laughed out loud at the binder thing, at school I'd have 7 empty binders and One with everything crammed into the pockets, it's one of those things where adhd makes us behave really stupidly like that but I find it's really funny when it happens without heavy consequences like the binder thing You're welcome.  Just wanted to let you know both that it's never too late and that success in school doesn't mean you can't be ADHD. Actually, I wasn't looking for diagnosis at all. I was at my doctor's for a totally unrelated issue, and he was asking about how I schedule my medication. 

As I was explaining that I had a hard time remembering to take it, and was digging through my ridiculously disorganized backpack looking for the pill bottle to figure out how long I'd gone since my last refill, he started asking me questions about other habits that I might have. That lead to a full-blown questionnaire for ADHD symptoms, which lead to diagnosis. 

I wasn't suggesting your post was redundant (sorry if you took it that way!), but I thought you might find some helpful stuff in the other post. I hope that the process of diagnosis one way or another goes smoothly for you! Warning, wall of text.
I'm female. My brother was diagnosed much earlier in life. I think you may be right about the gender gap. Maybe it manifests differently in women, like how heart attacks have different, atypical symptoms in women which causes them to be missed more often than in men. 

I've only used low doses of medication, more than that gave me the jitters. That's probably one contributing factor in getting off meds. I weaned myself off during the summer because I wasn't in school. I thought I'd try going without and only using it if I really need it. So far this semester it's been good. I think another big part of being able to get off meds was getting my depression under control. Also, it turns out I have a vitamin D deficiency, and since treating that, I've felt better too. The ADHD is still there but manageable. The Stayfocusd Google chrome extension has helped a lot, along with multiple lists and calendars of assignments. 

Unfortunately, being American, money has played a role in my healthcare decisions. I had gone to the university health center, and they were okay, but I think they flat out refused to diagnose ADHD...just their crappy policy. They might give referrals though. I went to an off campus provider that was recommended by a friend. I'm sorry you don't have insurance, I've been there too. Try to get a discount card of some kind. Drug manufacturers have assistance programs to help with costs too. The manufacturer stopped the copay card program for my meds, and now I can't afford $100 per fill. Rather than switching to something else, I decided to try going without, since I've been feeling a lot better. I've done the research and know the cheaper alternatives if I need meds in the future. Having worked in a pharmacy before, it's easier for me to navigate their bizarre pricing.  *exceeded. Phones are bad for grammar and editing.  Ha, thanks! I don't think they are resurfacing so much as that I am finally understanding how broadly having ADHD affects my whole life and personality.  Oh wow. If I had been graded on my organizational skills in high school, they would have sent me back to kindergarten! That's intense! I just received the packet of notes from all the psychiatric evals 20 years ago. My teachers noted the good quality of my homework but also that my desk was always a godforsaken disaster. And even then I didn't like it but felt powerless to change it.  THIS. I started studying 9 hours ago. I'm on page 3. I sit down and pep talk myself, and I stare at my work until I just can't handle sitting any more. Then it's time for a snack/potty break/any excuse to go move around. 

Does reddit count as hyperfocus? Ha. I realize how often I distract myself while studying:  researching ADHD, trying to organize and plan my day/life, even cleaning is better than studying! I've tried minimizing distractions, but I seem to have mastered daydreaming and staring at the wall also. 

Everyone I have talked to literally says: You're too smart to have ADHD, you just don't know how to study. Something just doesn't feel right to me to care as much as I do about my performance, and still not get anything done - if that makes sense!
 Glad someone can relate, haha! Oh no, not offended at all! After scouring the internet my computer basically autofills DO I HAVE ADHD!?! into everything right now, and I really didn't want my post to come off that way, that's all :) .          

That's so funny! That sounds a lot like my life: (( I know it's in here somewhere....ahh, give me just a second, nope, not that... supposed to turn that in last week... oh, THAT's where that went!, etc.))             

Thank you for sharing! Yeah, medication will definitely help you. It's tough, kiddo.  I know.  Sometimes I just wanna rip my own brain out and throw it at a wall. Hang in there.  While I'm thinking about it, back when I was still reeling from the diagnosis, my doc recommended [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-ebook/dp/B005GFII62/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1379820776&sr=8-2&keywords=add), which helped me make sense of everything. Passing it on in case you're interested in a more comprehensive source than most of the stuff that's online. Thanks for sharing!  Definitely! The online sources are very vague and I wonder if everyone doesn't come off thinking they have ADHD. But being a poor college student, I might wait until post therapy meeting to invest, haha.             

Which reminds me: do you have trouble reading with ADHD? I LOVE reading books - IF they interest me. If they are good - I almost hyperfocus (if I can use that word) on them - and I won't put them down until they are finished. Harry Potter, for example, took a few baths, car rides, and kept me up til 4 am on school nights. BUT, if it is required reading and I can't get into it, not going to happen, ever. 

Just curious about a personal perspective! You might be able to find the book in your library (that's how I got my hands on it, anyway).

Good question! Reading (fiction) is my favorite thing, to the point that my dad would joke that I had books grafted to my hands when I was growing up. That's where hyperfocus always kicks in for me. Someone can be standing in front of me trying to talk to me, and I won't notice until I'm physically nudged. I can't read on public transportation because I'll miss my stop. But it has to be something I'm into. Some required reading (*Grapes of Wrath* especially) was impossible for me to get into and so I just didn't do it.

Until grad school, I could get by with just the lectures in classes that I wasn't into. Now I'm trying to figure out medication so that I can better handle reading student papers, reading for things other than my own research, etc. It's been a struggle.

Edit to add: the book also helped me with the "it sounds like everyone has ADHD" issue. It gets specific enough that you can definitely pick out particular symptoms, and it also considers other issues that can cause those symptoms (like anxiety/depression/stress).
