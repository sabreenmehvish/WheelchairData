I need some information on how to get my medication. A little backstory:

* I've been diagnosed (multiple separate times through separate providers) with ADHD for a little over 5 years now. 
* I'm 23 and my parents have no insurance, nor do I live with/near them.
* I'm going to school across the state and am in a summer internship (paid, but not enough for private insurance) that's in a different state.
* I was on medicaid for a while but it only covered psychological treatment, I needed my coverage transferred to my school's county, but they won't let me move it unless I'm currently going to school. (I start back up in September)
* I need my medication to function, but I haven't had the ability to get access to even a prescription let alone the medication itself. 
* I've been borrowing off of someone else because they don't need it anymore. (Grew out of it, they were diagnosed as a kid.)
* I'm tired of feeling like i'm being teased by health institutions. I need my medication to function. I've been told by so many professionals that I need it and I found the exact medication and dosage that works consistently for me. (Vyvanse 40mg)

Now that the backstory is out of the way, I need your help. 

I'm hopeful that someone on here can point me in the right direction as to how I can find a consistent source of my medication. 

As of now, I'm a full time student with no insurance and no time to have a full\-time job, but I don't plan on being like this for more than a year. I need a temporary solution that allows me to finish school with a decent GPA. I can handle it from there.

If my wall of text was too much, I'm sorry. This was kind of a vent, too. 

If you need further clarification or information, don't hesitate to ask. I'll do my best to respond in a timely fashion. I believe Vyvanse in particular has a prescription savings program on their company website and some people depending on their income end up getting it free entirely. I pasted some info below.
