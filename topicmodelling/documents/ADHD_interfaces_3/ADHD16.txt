Reading eBooks Hey everyone!

Have you ever went to buy a textbook and realized the ebook is (sometimes) hundreds of dollars cheaper? Do you struggle with reading on screens? Have you ever not done a required reading because it was an article you couldn't afford to print out? 

Well this has been me the last two years at college. I HATE reading on screens, academically at least. I find it hard to read and retain academic information. With fiction, I don't need to remember every detail. I don't need to worry if I skip a line or a word. It doesn't even matter if I'm not paying 100% attention. 

Yesterday I finally found something that worked. I used a text to speech converter to help me read simultaneously to my actual reading and yall. It works great. If I miss a word or line it doesn't trip me up because I heard it. If I mishear something it doesn't matter because I read it. Is Google lady's choppy, disjointed voice a little annoying? I can change it to another accent and speed to match my internal reading speed. 

This might not work for you but I urge you to try it, especially if you're just starting college. This has cut my reading time way down and really helped me with reading retention. 

Good luck in everything!
