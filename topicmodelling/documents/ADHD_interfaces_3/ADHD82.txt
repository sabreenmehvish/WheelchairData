Can’t focus on studying? Try text-to-speech. It’s my final exam month (yeah, not week) and I wasn’t being able to concentrate. I decided to give a shot to text-to-speech and man, I’m happy. I’ve been fidgeting with my pen and whatever I have in hand while listening and I find it *easier* than reading these days!

Thought someone could use the tip :)
I’m using “ClaroPDF” on my iPad but there are more options... “Natural Reader” is great, too!
