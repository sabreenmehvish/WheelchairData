What's the most offensive comment/text you've received about your ADHD? Genuinely curious about comments from friends, family members, employers, etc.

Bonus points for screenshots! [removed] Always love the 'you're not even trying' comments. Like OH, you wanna see me not trying? Because I can show you not trying.  "What's wrong with your head?"

"You aren't listening, aren't you? I won't explain it again because it's useless..."

"You aren't putting effort"

Every comment like these ones chip away more and more of my self esteem. “Are you on drugs?”

No ^I’m ^^actually ^^^off ^^^^them... Not a text, but in person my dad told me I used it as a crutch to take drugs and pass school. I had a 3.0 average and only take my prescribed medication. Lol he’s a crazy boi A boyfriend once told me that he didn’t want to have kids with me because he didn’t want them to have my “problems” he was referring to my add because I didn’t take my meds that day It hurts more now than it did then, but my 11th grade English Literature teacher told me that I was the biggest disappointment of her 40 year career.  Other teachers told me their inability to get me to work to my potential was their biggest failing as an educator.  I laughed it off then, because what could I do?  I had no idea.

Now, it makes me feel angry and sad at what could have been.  I’m still young (32) and I have so much potential but what I’ve missed out on hurts. Just a whole childhood of being called lazy and selfish by people who should have been more clued up. My school said I was the laziest boy on the school, constant detentions rather than support. I feel like that's more damaging than any one comment.  "Why can't you try harder?!" From parents who refused to let me be on meds. They would later gush over how well I'm going in college. I'm on meds now.

"So...you're on meth-lite? I legit now a methhead now!" - A good friend, while I found it slightly funny, it did hurt it bit.

Edit: Spelling  "Sounds like *someone* needs to manage their time better." I had my friend tell another friend of mine on the phone how he was angry at me for not being serious in life and that I was a failure and he didn't want to be around me because he didn't want his productivity to suffer. I heard it because my friend had it on loudspeaker and he didn't know I was listening. I cried for 2 days straight. You don’t have ADHD. People with ADHD don’t get masters degrees.-  My Father-in-law A few years ago, I finally told my boss I have ADHD.  His reply was, "Really? I think I have it too! Sometimes I forget stuff!" and I tried to explain that it was a fuck-ton worse than just "sometimes forgetting stuff"- I wish that's all it was... that would mean I was normal...   


I hated how he just dismissed me like that...  Not strictly an offensive comment about my ADHD, but I remember being offended, hurt even, when people called me arrogant. I tend(ed) to drift off during conversations or lectures and it made people feel I was disinterested or felt too good (to pay attention) to them. To me its "that's true for everyone " or "yeah me too" from a neurotypical. It really makes me mad! I'm thinking, ok mr or ms perfect, then why am I the butt of all Dory and blonde jokes. And I'm not blonde! Why do I work harder than anyone else I know (besides my adhd dad). Everyone is NOT like this. You don't get it. I'd rather be told I'm lazy. At least I can point out that I'm still finishing charts st midnight when colleagues are long since sleeping I'm sure. And those who know me know it's true. But the "me too" and "happens to everyone " stuff is not up for debate or even discussion! a non-neurotypical friend recently reduced ADHD down to "an attention issue" and I almost lost it on her You cant have ADHD, you're smart!

 In my senior year of high schol, we were talking about mental disorders in my Spanish class,  my teacher confidently said that ADHD was not real becouse "everybody gets distracted sometimes" and said that people diagnosed with it are just being tooled with. 

I was diagnosed with ADD when I was a Child and I´ve been dealing with it all my life, and her comment made me feel for the first time genuinely mad at someone at the point that I wanted to leave that class inmediately   I work in a toy store. Often I'll recommend something, and the customer will laugh and say 'Oh no, [child] has ADHD, he could never do that'

 One of my close-ish friends who probably has ADHD as well told me it doesn't exist even though he knows he might have it... that made sense.

Also, I just came back from the Georgia Governor's Honors Program, and my RA legitimately told me I needed to "do [my] best" to not interrupt during our hall checks... I mean, it's not a bad suggestion, but the way he said it implied I wasn't doing my best. That plus a bunch of other BS made me really mad at him but I forgave him and put it aside luckily. “Okay well, first off you're kind of an asshole who needs to take their meds more.” They said that I’m an asshole because I wasn’t being nice to people who were telling me to kill myself. They also said “I don’t mean that as an insult.” 

“You are a raging maniac who needs to be subdued by meds.” (I already take medication for my ADHD. 54 mg of concerta when I wake up, 15 mg of Ritalin at noon, and 15 g of Ritalin later in the afternoon. My ADHD is super severe so I have to take a lot)

“If you can’t control yourself when you’re off your meds, do you really think you should even interact with people?”

“Are you off your fucking meds again?” Just because we were arguing.

 I recently texted my mom about my attention issues, which I’m usually secretive about because when I was 13, I wanted to see a psychatrist because I was having attention and social issues but the idea was shot down by my parents immediately. They simply told me that I don’t apply myself and need to focus more. Nearly 7 years later, I still have really bad procrastination issues and have trouble staying on task, and while I do make decent grades (graduated with a 3.9 GPA at my community college in CS and math, so people assume I’m smart but I just learned how to finesse), I know I could do better. After being extremely frustrated over a research project because I really couldn’t get myself to work on it, I brought up the possibility of having ADHD again and seeking help and here are a few of the things she told me:

“i hope ur not pregnant.”

“u dont need psychiatrist. u just need more time for ur family. pls. dont keep any secrets coz we cant help u if we dont know whats going on.”

“maybe ur too overworked. take some time off, relax & unwind.”

“i think u need time to go to church & pray for ur piece of mind. go with us to church on sundays. be open & treat ur family more important than ur friends.“

“try harder to regain ur intetest in school. u know i had to give up my studies just to be a responsible parent to u.”

“everbody is jealous of u coz ur very smart.”

Among a whole lot of similar comments. In the end, I did convince her that I should go seek help because I told her I was unhappy with myself. A few months ago my younger brother almost attempted suicide because of the pressure put on him by my parents. They have the best intentions, but they don’t quite understand me or my brother very well. I notice ADHD symptoms in both my brother (procrastination and hyperactivity) and my mom (procrastination, lazy perfectionism, kinda scatterbrained and still hasn’t gotten around to scheduling my appointment), but these are things I’m not gonna bring up to her because it was hard enough to convince her that I need help. I haven't talked to many people about my ADHD, but when I told my father about it on the phone for the first time, I was saying how medication has helped me feel so much better with more focus and energy and his reply was:

 "Sounds like meth."

Thanks pops. That is so INCREDIBLY fucked up.  Not as crazy as your story, but all the kids in my class petitioned to have me kicked out of the Heritage Fair (like a science fair for history, but only the top few projects could enter) 

All because I started crying after the teacher interrupted me in the middle of my presentation. I was really anxious and RSD kicked in and well, you know how that is. The kids made a huge protest about me getting picked telling me repeatedly the teachers only chose me cause I was a baby and they felt sorry for me. 

I did the project on my Grandpa working as a gold mine elevator operator and it was FANTASTIC. I brought in his old hardhat and harnesses and tools and tons of old photos. I worked my ass off. It was by far one of the best projects and it was all done IN FRENCH. IN GRADE 6. I DIDN"T EVEN SPEAK FRENCH AT HOME.

Yeah, they kicked me out of the fair.  What the fuck that's absolutely ridiculous  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK I’m so mad High school can be so fucking Darwinian. 

I'm really upset that the administration didn't speak up about abusing people with disabilities, but then again considering the bs you already had to deal with maybe they thought better to not go there.

At least your teacher "got it". That is actually insane! Like some movie shit. You must have gone to a really tough to get type of high school, all the schools I've gone to people would be applauding me for using a "cheat code". That petition, Damn!

Is the username accurate or should I have aimed higher than /u/FuckJam? I'm glad I'm not the only person with this reaction. :X I get so damned contrary sometimes. (Bonus points if you've actually proceeded to "not try" even though it was a terrible idea.) Don't get sad; get mad and prove them wrong! > "You aren't listening, aren't you? I won't explain it again because it's useless..."

Thats the most offensive comment you received?

Just saying; from the perspective of an outsider thats just how it feels for them.

Its a two way road guys.
 "Do you smoke weed?"

No. I swear. I'm just like this.  This happened to me constantly in school and my parents were both drug addicts so I was heavily against drugs, especially after my mom OD'ed. I still think about those kind of comments a lot and Im always terrified I'm going to be accused of literlaly raking drugs if I act too crazy at work or something :'( My stepdad told me that in 5th grade. Told me to quit using all the stuff and deal with it on my own. Worked for awhile. Now i wosh i still had my adderal Was this the moment he became your ex? [deleted] It's not strictly genetic, it's quite likely your children won't have it but also quite possible they will. Even if he has kids with someone else they might still have it. Your teachers were assholes Holy shit, I just realised that the reason I got after school detentions were because I consistently handed stuff in late. Triggered me.  FUCKING Indian bitch supervisor. My sister, also diagnosed ADHD, has her doctorate.  She wasn't diagnosed till after she had her PhD; NO ONE believed her. Idk how his tone was, but it's possible he was trying to be nice and maybe relate to you (of course failing at doing so). I've had people do this to me before and it does leave me confused, but I think maybe they were just trying to be nice. Most people don't really understand ADHD it seems and perhaps they were just trying to relate to you, something that pretty much all humans try to do on a personal level. Have you ever seen one of Dr. Barkley's videos where he talks about how poorly named ADHD is? I'm paraphrasing but he basically said calling ADHD an attention disorder is like calling ASD a hand flapping disorder. It's named by it's most obvious symptom not it's root cause. It also just sounds trivial so no wonder people have the reaction of "I have bigger issues to deal with than the fact that you just can't pay attention. Go drink some caffeine." It really should be named executive functioning deficit. So where are you at now? Is it possible for you to make an appointment on your own? > That is so INCREDIBLY fucked up.

/u/medahman 

I know.  The part that kills me is the complete lack of action by the principal.  I called him out on it too.  He just shrugged his shoulders and said "That's life" tried to walk away and I...  sort of yelled and swore at him.  I blew my top at him and the cop who showed up.   This is sick and I’m so sorry that happened to you. People are such asshats. May I ask what RSD is? > High school can be so fucking Darwinian.
> 
> I'm really upset that the administration didn't speak up about abusing people with disabilities, but then again considering the bs you already had to deal with maybe they thought better to not go there.
>

American high schools are like prison.  It is all about your reputation and clique.  Yes, all of my teachers got it and assured me that petitions don't have any real power. [removed] I get you about the contrary thing. I was so angry at my teacher for saying I write too small and light every. single. day. so natually I handed in an essay completely written in caps, in permanent marker, in huge letters. It was like 30 pages long. 

Starting to see why we didn't get along... But she never complained about my writing again. She probably should have though, because I continue to have terrible tiny writing. Oops.

EDIT: Just realized that this is more of a 'OH I'LL SHOW YOU TRYING' situation. Oh well :) Of course that's offensive. Yeah it's frustrating dealing with people with ADHD, but I guarantee you it's way more frustrating being the person with ADHD who just cannot follow a conversation no matter how hard I try. It can take extra effort to explain something to a person with ADHD. Sometimes you have to explain it 5 different times, sometimes you have to write it down, sometimes you have to draw us a picture. Maybe you'll have to do all those things and make 10 copies of the picture and post it all over house and put reminders in my phone to look at the damn picture. And then plug in my phone for me because you know I forgot to charge it. Even if you put in all that effort it's still less that all the effort I put in everyday trying function at half the level of a neurotypical person. Whoever said this may as well have said, "You're not worth the extra effort it will take to explain this one more time. I give up on you." How is that not offensive? Just make sure he gets the attention to it that he needs and that if he does have it he gets diagnosed etc. I wish well for you and your children 😀 Some of them were for sure.  I think many of them had just never dealt with a student as irritating as me.  I was shocked that not one of them throughout my 12 years of school and 4 years of college ever picked up on the possibility of something like ADHD.

My dream is, now that I’m getting treated and my star is rising fast in the working world, to write my high school a giant check someday (it’s a small Catholic school) with the stipulation that some small percentage be used for training on recognizing ADHD signs. Unfortunately, this was not the case... I was explaining my ADHD to him and he was dismissive in his tone...  This is from his lecture titled "the 30 things you need to know" about ADHD. It's on YouTube!!  He isn't wrong in the fact that that, "that's life", but he is wrong for giving into it instead of thinking of the wellbeing and education of his students. I think blowing your top is understandable here.

Silver lining is that the meds were definitely helping!  wow. I would have switched schools after that. Not OP but RSD is rejection sensitive dysphoria, when we’re sensitive to criticism because we perceive it way differently than reality.*     





(* I say we to be inclusive but not all ADHDers have it) RSD= Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. Commonly alongside ADHD. 

If you've ever burst into angry shaking uncontrollable crying after a small slight like being interrupted or corrected, or feeling an almost primal need to escape after an embarrassment, it might be RSD. It's basically your brain going into fight or flight mode at the smallest provocation. 

In this case the teacher interrupted me in the middle of a sentence when I was already really on edge and I burst out crying and ran out of the classroom while everyone laughed. :/  Uh.... yeah no, stop "All bullying"? I'm a girl and I was bullied mercilessly by girls, who called me a retard and sang songs about how ugly my hair was and slapped me so hard my braces cut the insides of my mouth. You can quit that shit. Not every bully is trying to get laid and not every bully is male.

Women are not necessarily attracted to men "imposing their will" either. Most of my female friends are terrified of aggressive men and hate the pushy ones who try to act like they're in charge all the time. I also am annoyed usually by the """"""alpha"""""" (hate that term) type. I myself am a domme and exclusively pursue submissive men.  It still sounds exactly like me though. LMAO.   That extra effort we have to put in can be a real strength as you get older. These comments *are* offensive, but they are generally not meant with malice, just frustration. It hurts, it sucks, but we can use it to do better. I didnt know I had ADHD when i got those types of comments, so I blamed myself a lot for it. Because I didnt know why, I spent a lot of energy finding ways around those issues.

I am not trying to diminish the offensiveness of such comments. I dont think people without ADHD can understand what it is like, it is hard to imagine what it is like given it is a structural difference in the brain. 

It is a two way road, we can really frustrate people. But I will tell you this, if you recognise this and find ways that work for you to work around it, you will be these people's boss one day. I didnt say its not offensive. Iam just saying people often not realize that you find it that offensive. Often thats more like a phrase people put out because they are more or less not able to understand the problem.

Its as hard for you to understand how people can manage daily routines easily as is it hard for them to understand whats actually your problem. Yeah its offensive. But maybe think twice about it why people say it. They mean it probably not really offensive.

 I've gotten that before too. Its very hard to know if they get it and are trying to normalize it, don't get it and being dismissive, get it and possibly have it. Etc. So I get paranoid about it and have only told a few. My clinic manager is NOT one of them!  Thank you! I was having trouble finding it again. > He isn't wrong in the fact that that, "that's life", but he is wrong for giving into it instead of thinking of the wellbeing and education of his students.

>

Well, he didn't "give in" to anything, he simply took absolutely no action.  It was a form of harassment & bullying; how dare an outsider make it into the clique!  IMO it was parents who put their kids up to this. > wow. I would have switched schools after that.

That was my mistake.  My parents offered to send me to a private school, but being so young and stupid I didn't want to leave everything I knew behind. Holy. Crap. Thank you for this. I just did a little reading and am already positive that my daughter (10) and I (40) both had this. This explains so much, I don’t even know where to begin. We only were diagnosed less than a year ago, so I still have a ton to learn. This is amazing. I had no idea this was a thing. This has been my entire life, my relationship with my dad, with my husband....Thank you. The meds I found mentioned won’t be an option for either of us, unfortunately, because we can’t risk lowering our already pathologically low BP (dysautonomia), but just knowing this is a thing is potentially life-changing. Wow.  [removed] Even if you understand the problem, it can be frustrating to deal with people who have ADHD. I get that. I have ADHD myself, but I also have family and friends with ADHD and I've taught students with ADHD. You could understand the disorder perfectly but teaching or explaining something to a person with ADHD can still feel like banging your head agaist a wall. But that's not an excuse for being rude to them.

Living with ADHD is much much harder than understanding it. I know because I've done both. ADHD isn't really hard to understand at all. It is just a delay in the development of executive functioning. I plan, organize, regulate my emotions, monitor my behavior, and stay on task just as well as any normal 12 year old. Problem is I'm 24. Not a hard problem to understand, just a hard one to deal with.

As for thinking twice about why people say it, I've thought about it thousands of times. I think about it every time someone makes a comment like that to me. But I also think about it every time I want to say something like that to my student or my friend or my brother or mom. Even though I understand the disorder, I still get frustrated and my first reaction is to lash out at the person who isn't paying  attention. But I stop and remind myself that it's not their fault and they're probably trying at least as hard as I am. And then I say "I can tell that you're struggling to listen. Do you need a break before we try again? If I did x, y, or z would that make it easier for you?" Even with my impared ability to regulate my emotions and self-monitor I still usually manage to bite my tongue and hold back my frustration and find empathy instead. And when I fail and say something offensive or harmful to their self esteem? I don't make excuses about not understanding. I apologize. I say "I'm sorry I got frustrated. This is hard, but that's not your fault.  I know you're trying, I'm the one who needs to try harder so I can make this easier for you."

You say it's a two way street, so walk down that street and meet the person with ADHD halfway. If you don't understand the problem they're dealing with, then you haven't even taken the first step. Read a book or an article. Watch a YouTube video. Attend a conference on ADHD. If someone in your family has ADHD, go to therapy with them.  Educate yourself. Everyone get frustrated and snaps sometimes, but that warrants and apology not an excuse. Not understanding someone is not an excuse for not being kind. I guess I assumed that giving in was doing nothing, but it really wasn't. Giving in would have been following the request of the petition. You're right in the that he took no action. There's a lot of these holy crap moments here isn't there.

I found out what RSD was from this subreddit and from that point on I stopped beating myself around the head every time I'd be crushed over a simple date that didn't work out or if someone didn't want to chat on a dating site, so it has helped in that respect Oh wow, I'm really glad I was able to help out! 

Even just being able to identify and understand what's going on allows you to develop strategies to deal with it moving forward. Best of luck to you and your daughter!! :D You are ignoring that bullying happens for any other reason, and maybe that is a trend but I don't think it is nearly as strong as you think and I can tell you indisputably that I am one of many, many dominant women into submissive men  I know all of that.

> ADHD isn't really hard to understand at all.

Maybe. But usually people dont care about things that dont affect them. I choosed to live with a person with ADHD so i know all of that and try to act accordingly but demanding this from a random person (who actually must not even know about you and your ADHD) is pretty strange. Thank you! > But usually people dont care about things that dont affect them.

And that's exactly what bothers me. This is the source of so much harm, not just all of the offensive comments here. Yeah, iam with you there. Absolutely.
