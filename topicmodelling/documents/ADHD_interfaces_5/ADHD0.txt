what are good internet blockers that interface well with you? Seriously I need to get off reddit and everything. I used to use cold turkey but then it updated and got frustrating. Using windows mostly.  I like Leechblock, because of the delay function.  


When a blocker totally blocks a site, i often need to check it for some legit reason so I disable the blocker and then get caught.  


With Leechblock, you can set it up so it, for example, makes you wait 30 seconds before Twitter opens. If you alt-tab away, the countdown resets - you have to have the tab open and nothing else for 30 seconds before you can access the site.  


So when I open it up automatically, see the delay screen, even if I decide i'm going to wait 30 seconds, i usually impulsively alt-tab away because it's not entertaining me.   


Leechblock also seems to have the best level of tailoring (lots of different sets of sites you can block for different times, or set maximum minutes to view, etc).  


You can also set an override - say 2 minutes - so again if you do actually need to check something (time of an event on facebook) you can hit override and it will give you access for 2 minutes. In practice, I just kept hitting override again and again - the delay function has worked much better for me. Plus, when i DO decide to wait the 30 seconds, i use the time to do deep breathing exercises, which probably helps too. I use stay focused but i might switch as it's too easy to turn off. Forest is a good one for phones. Nice! That time delay aspect sounds pretty great. Good to know, thanks!
