Saw a wheelchair fall from a vehicle at W. Alabama and Travis. I was driving down Travis and a vehicle next to mine had a wheelchair fall out the back. If you know who lost their wheelchair let me know! 

Share this in Facebook and everywhere! Someone has to know a really pissed off person who is missing their wheelchair. [deleted] Was the wheelchair on a small platform on the back of the truck bed?  If so, don't worry about who might be missing it.  Had a run in with the person yesterday walking to the bus stop.  Admitted he was "still drunk".  Most likely a disability scammer. I'm keeping the vehicle type to myself so if someone claims it I can verify. No news on a possible owner.
