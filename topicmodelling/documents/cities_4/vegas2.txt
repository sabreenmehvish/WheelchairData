what time should we get to McCarran on Christmas Eve? flight leaves at 2:30 BUT i will be with my 87 year old Grandma. never flew out on Cmas eve so unsure what the crowd will be like (though i'm sure busy) and she will need to check a bag. I was thinking about getting there around 11:30

looking for some input here When you get to the counter, request a wheelchair for her.  They will escort her to the front of the boarding pass check line, and right to the front of the X-ray and body scanner line.  Once at the gate they will board her first.  As her traveling companion you will get to go with her.
 When you check in at the ticket counter ask for a wheelchair for your grandma - it's free (just tip the person pushing it for you) and you go straight to the front of the security line! The general rule of thumb is atleast 2 hours, so at 11:30, you'll be more than okay.  Terminal 1 or 3?  I think you're fine for either spot, but terminal 3 should be less busy. Especially if checking a bag.   Jet Blue is T3
