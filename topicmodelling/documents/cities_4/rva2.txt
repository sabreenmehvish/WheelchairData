Wheelchair access to the river? My wheelchair bound mother is visiting and I'd love to take her to the river to watch the kids play, but I haven't been able to find any access points that are wheelchair accessible. Any advice? Thank you. The pedestrian path to Belle Isle is Handicap accessible. The island itself is a rough graveled path however. I wouldn't say it is inaccessible but will be a little rough. Would need to help push and be careful.  Browns Island would be a good spot. The west end of the island overlooks that area where there are always a lot of people using a rope swing under the train trestle. And you could take her on the Pottersfield bridge as well.  T-Pot bridge path is ADA compliant. 42nd st. Has a wheel chair accessible ramp down to the water, you have cross about 150 ft. Of crushed gravel but it is feasible. 

The overlook on the south side of the Manchester Bridge is accessible. 

The T-Pot bridge is also accessible.  adding another vote for tpot. they closed the path to make it properly ADA compliant on the Manchester side of the river recently. also lots of places to park it and enjoy the river while on the bridge. good luck! The wetlands had a 1/4 mile drive to the river that they supposedly will open for ADA with a call ahead. Belle Isle is your best bet. It has multiple places that have handicap access to the river. It is supposed to be accessible as far as the fishing pier on the quarry pond--but rain can wash it out. There are a few dips and washouts for sure. Navigable, but probably needs a little extra care and help.  there's definitely a wheelchair point at down to the rocks/swimming areas at one point
