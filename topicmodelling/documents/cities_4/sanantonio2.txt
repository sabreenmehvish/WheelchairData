Where to rent or borrow a wheelchair for son? We're ooking to take our 9 year old boy to the March Madness music festival on Saturday but he recently had a bicycle accident and is in crutches. It would be easier for him to get around enjoy the concerts on a wheelchair so we're wondering where we'd be able to rent or borrow one for the day.

Thanks in advance. There are a few places downtown near the festival that sells / rent medical equipment.

Just do a quick search of *wheelchair rental* and it should bring them up for you. See if you know someone with a BOB stroller. It would work well. Ability Scooters on Gulfdale does rentals. My husband and I used them after he got surgery and needed one of those knee scooter thingies. Very nice man that worked there and the pricing wasn’t too bad. Thank you all for your input, we were able able to rent one from downtown. There's a medical supply place off of Wurzbach and Fredericksburg, not sure if they do daily rentals but maybe.  Where is this festival and when is it? Hemisfair Park tomorrow.  It’s free and supposed to have decent acts for it.
