Is it illegal to park in crosswalks in the city?  Yeah, probably a silly question. I have a crosswalk outside my apartment that people park in quite a bit (I live near the Clement St. shopping district and I guess it's easier than finding a pay spot). I've only ever seen one person get a ticket, though. I don't particularly care one way or another, just figure I should know so that I can warn someone if I see them pull up. One area of confusion might be that there isn't a wheelchair ramp at one end of the crosswalk.  Totally illegal, not to mention rude.
