Residents step up build Florissant boy new wheelchair ramp  Saw them building this on my way home Saturday, very cool!  [deleted] That's so funny! OMG how did you come up with that? Is it because the *child* has a spinal cord injury and can't walk? OMG that's the funniest thing I've ever heard! Wow, can you imagine how much he must struggle to live a normal life? So much so that some passerby noticed and got all these concerned citizens to help this poor boy. Whew! What a knee-slapper!
