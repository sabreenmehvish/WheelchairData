Question for those in law enforcement Recently a post acute care/ rehabilitation center had a large and expensive window shattered when a rock was thrown at it by a disgruntled former resident who had been forced to leave after being caught smoking pot. He also had a warrant out.  When the police showed up the staff was told there was a new rule or law against bringing someone to jail who was in a wheelchair. Anyone know about this? Maybe they didn't have the right vehicle to transport someone in a wheelchair and were just making excuses? That would be a really bad loophole lol  I'm not law enforcement but people with disabilities of any kind are not above the law and do suffer consequences for breaking it.   
Is there security footage? Was a police report filed? check out /r/AskLEO  Handcuffs and a tow strap and youâ€™re set! /s That's what I was wondering. I don't know about security footage (which I'm sure they'll install cameras now if they don't) but a police report was filled and there were witnesses.

It sounded like bullshit. I wasn't sure if there was any truth to or they didn't want to be bothered with the hassle of taking in a non violent criminal who is in a wheelchair. He wasn't at the scene when they arrived but honestly couldn't have gone that far that fast.
