Chesterfield residents complain about the only cool thing in Chesterfield  He could be carrying a bottle of hot sauce, about to wheel it over to some tacos.  I think it is adorable. The only thing I will complain about is the proofreading.

*"Ms. Wheelchair Virginia 2013 is speaks out highly against drinking and driving.‚Äù*

I is highly offended;; Oh my god, if this doesn't show how boring Chesterfield is, then I don't know what will. Seriously, who gets offended by something like that? Nacho Nacho Maaaan I want to be a Nacho Man How could anyone possibly be offended by this, the restaurant owner should tell him to go shove it. "How am I supposed to explain this to my children?" 'i'm not offended, but someone else could be... so i'm going to speak for them'. describes midlo perfectly.

source: grew up there Chesterfield, a lovely place for an ebola outbreak. And it's obviously his (no tits to be a girl) birthday because he got a free sombrero.  You don't think it be like it is but it do. Shoving wheelchairs is rude RVAGOD IN a weird way this is a good teachable moment for kids. See kids people in wheel chairs are just people. They like drinking and tacos just like everyone else.  :-( My brain just fell on the floor with a big wet smack. Shove his ass down a steep hill [Like this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5le9sYdYkM) Exactly like that I was hoping that's what this link would be. Are you Paul Rudd? I laugh every time I come across that clip. Hilarious
