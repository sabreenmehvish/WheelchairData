Toy donations for a good cause A little background info before I ask for anything...

Some of you who know me IRL know the story about my hip. If it weren't for the Shriner's Hospital system, I'd be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life. If you are curious about the story, I'll share later on.

I started this at work and just got the crazy idea to expand it to r/SanAntonio. I'm collecting toys, books, and games for the Shriner's Hospital in Houston. For those of you that don't know, the Shriners offer free care to children who have orthopedic problems as well as burn victims. The hospitals each have a Child Life department that does whatever possible to make the patients' lives as comfortable as possible, but they rely mainly on donated items. 

I'm looking to collect as many items as I can to deliver to them as a way to say "thank you" and brighten the days of the kids.

* Toys: New, latex-free toys
* Games: New and used games are OK
* Books: New and used books are OK

Anything appropriate for any age group, newborn to 18, is greatly appreciated. I will be going to Houston on the 19th to deliver them.

Thanks in advance.

Jay [deleted] I can meet anywhere in town when I'm not working, or my other thought was to set up a meetup on the 16th or 17th.
