Man with prosthetic legs robbed of wheelchair, money  The whole thing is disturbing but what really gets me is wondering what the thief is going to do with a used wheelchair. I can't imagine there being a huge market for that. So at that point this thief is just being an asshole.  Yeah, they just left it down the street.  Ya, he walked that extra mile just to be cruel.  deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9036  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/38937) I think you're overestimating the value of metal and underestimating the value of drugs No I think the robber barons as overestimating the value of the metal
