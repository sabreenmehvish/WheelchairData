Like board games? Beer? Come hang out with us! Hi all! I read the rules and I'm pretty sure this type of post is allowed here but just let me know if not.

​

We're starting a new board game meetup for the Bay Area. Our first event is scheduled for Monday, September 10th at Sunset Reservoir Brewing Company. We'll be bringing a variety of games, but feel free to bring your own to share! Totally free and you can show up/leave whenever.

If you can't come to this one but want to keep up with us, you can follow us on [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/playthebay/)or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/playthebay/)! Please let us know if you have any questions! Sounds like a fun idea. I'd just like to share an idea for a location that is not far from your first event.

The Game Parlour is also in the sunset and they specialize in board games! It's a great place I've been meaning to get back to. Wanted to put it on your radar if you were not already aware. NOTED I am up for it, moved here for tech job, need to meet some new friends. Just a few questions.

- Is the event restaurant wheelchair accessible, both to enter, and to move about in? That's usually defined as spaces 3 feet wide, with heights of no more than 2 inches to cross, as well as tables that are high enough for a wheelchair user to get close to (generally 3 feet high, for me).
- What sort of board games will be on offer? I know that you welcome people to bring their own, but for now, what will be there to play?
- How much can we reasonably expect to spend at the restaurant for beers/similar, tax/tips included? I know it's a variable, but it's helpful to have a price range in mind before arriving.

Thanks!
 Would I have to be 21 to enter?  This sounds awesome but I don't have facebook or instagram. Any other way to get details? That's an amazing location! I hope to join sometime :) NOTED Yeah, we liked that place! For a few reasons, we thought a brewery would be a better fit for our first event, but they're definitely on our radar :) Hope to see you there! We're relatively recent transplants to the area too. We did a similar thing in our previous city and it set in motion a really close-knit group that we're still good friends with today. I'm excited to see what happens this time! Accessibility: The brewery has no step to enter. The bar and some seating are all on the first level, and then there is a small ramp or three steps up to another level with more seating. There's a elevator or a full flight of stairs up to the second level mezzanine which has even more seating. Seems wide enough to move around in. A lot of the seating on the lower levels are booths but there are some tables with more flexible seating that a wheelchair should be able to fit under. I believe all of the upstairs is tables with movable chairs. Large single occupancy bathroom.  


Board games: We'll be bringing stuff like Codenames, The Resistance, Klask, Hardback, and Ghost Court. We're also open to suggestions. We moved across the country and left our collection with the last meetup we started, so we've been rebuying games piecemeal. If there's a particular game or style that you're interested in, let us know!  


Here's a link to the drinks menu: [http://sunsetbeersf.com/drinks/](http://sunsetbeersf.com/drinks/) . They serve food as well, so it's up to you how much you want to spend. I would imagine at the bare minimum probably \~10 dollars after tax and tip if you just get one beer.  


Hope to see you there! If I recall correctly, SRBC has two levels with the ground floor being wheelchair accessible, but it's been a bit since I was there. Beers are $7 with cocktails around $12. They have their menu on their website with prices. I know the brewery is a restaurant as well so I think you'd be okay to enter as long as you're not drinking. You may want to double check with them, but you should be good! We put it up on EventBrite too :)
