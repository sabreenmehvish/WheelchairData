Annual PSA: Low-Power Scooters Denver It's that time of year again!  Here is your annual overview of some of the rules for operating a Low-Power Scooter (less than 50 CCs) in Denver:  

- Under [Den. Rev. Mun. Code § 54-1](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIIREMUCO_CH54TRRE_ARTIINGE_S54-1DE), Low Power Scooter is defined as "a self-propelled vehicle designed primarily for use on the roadways with not more than three (3) wheels in contact with the ground, no manual clutch, and either of the following: (I) A cylinder capacity not exceeding fifty cubic centimeters if powered by internal combustion; or (II) A wattage not exceeding four thousand four hundred seventy-six (4,476) if powered by electricity. Low-power scooter shall not include a toy vehicle, bicycle, electrical assisted bicycle, wheelchair, or any device designed to assist mobility impaired people who use pedestrian rights-of-way."

- [Register](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/low-power-scooter) your low powered scooter with the State using this [application](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2701.pdf).  The cost is under $6, and you will receive a registration decal that is valid for three years.  Note, you must carry insurance and provide proof of insurance with your application.  

- You must have a valid drivers’ license per [Colo. Rev. Stat. § 42-2-103(2)(b)](http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2008a/sl_35.htm).

- [Colo. Rev. Stat. § 42-2-103(2)(b)](http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2008a/sl_35.htm) permits low-power scooters (i.e., less than 50 CCs) to be operated in the bicycle lanes upon the roadways.  The statute states the following:  **“Low-power scooters may be operated upon roadways . . . and in bicycle lanes included within such roadways.”**  That means, for example, a person can operate a low powered scooter in the bicycle lane on Stout Street, but it does not mean that a person can operate it on the Cherry Creek Trail (because it is not part of the roadway).  - Note, although Denver prohibits motor vehicles from using or entering the bicycle lane, low powered scooters are not considered motor vehicles pursuant to [Den. Rev. Mun. Code § 54-1(38)](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTIINGE_S54-1DE).  The code states, **“motor vehicle . . . does not include low-power scooters.”**

- Low-power scooters can be parked on the sidewalks.  A low-power scooter may be ridden on the sidewalk, for the purposes of parking the vehicle, from the roadway nearest to the point of parking on the sidewalk. A low-power scooter must not exceed a speed limit of six (6) miles per hour when on the sidewalk or what is reasonable under the existing conditions. The low-power scooter must yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian traffic.  [Den. Rev. Mun. Code 54-184](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTVIOPVE_DIV3RI-W_S54-184LWESCSI).  

- Under C.R.S. § 42-2-127, low-power scooters must not exceed the posted speed limit, and under no circumstance can a person operate a scooter at more than 40 MPH.

- Eye protection is required when operating a low-powered scooter.  E.g., [Den. Rev. Mun. Code 54-630](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTXMO_S54-630EYPRRE).  Although a helmet is not required, it is highly recommended.  

Enjoy your scooter and the beautiful weather!  See you on the road!   Man i really want to pick up a scooter to zip down to Sooper's and stuff.

Are there any reputable local shops? I'm ok with a China budget 49cc; i can turn a wrench and am familiar with engines Holy shit, i never knew scooters could ride on street bike lanes. I saw this in europe and thought it was smart [deleted] Two-stoke engines (like the ones often in these small scooters) produce a ridiculous amount of air pollution. Edmunds.com measured the pollution from running a two stroke leaf blower for 30 minutes as equal to driving a pickup truck 3,800 miles. Most people are not aware of this.  I actually have an extra one that I've upgraded quite a bit.  If you're interested, I'll give it to ya for cheap. I'm in Cap Hill.  http://imgur.com/v9qCWDF (the blue one) Check craigslist and such. I sold my Yamaha Vino for $600 last spring, and it was in great shape. I'm sure you can find a good deal on the private market. The dealers are always going to have higher priced items, but I trust Chris and Dan at Sportique on S. Broadway.  Sportique and Erico are the big ones here.  There was a lively [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/3qre68/yes_it_is_legal_to_ride_a_lowpower_scooter_in_the/) about it last year, and not everyone shared your enthusiasm. But alas, it is the law.  Thank you.  I should have put that in there.  I'll edit with a hat tip to you.   How much?  Interested! Nice, thanks for the direction. I was in on that conversation last year, and I think this is a fantastic reminder - thanks for doing it!

Ha, someone literally just down voted my comment from last year - hilarious! I've got quite of bit of money tied up in it. 80cc kit, inner storage rack, etc. I was hoping to get $500 for it.  Have all sorts of spare parts for it also.  I'm not trying to make money or anything, just get back some of what I spent. Could you send me some more pics of it please?
