A message to people who make small concessions to one another on the sidewalk A positive spin on an age-old thread. This is for residents and tourists alike, in NYC and beyond.

If you make small, unconscious accommodations to your fellow pedestrians, you're good people who should be praised. Examples include:

* avoiding a curb ramp to allow strollers, wheelchairs, and carts easy passage
* giving a wide buffer to popular entryways on the sidewalk to avoid collisions
* standing on the curb, and not in the bike lane, while you wait to cross
* holding plastic bags in front/behind you in busy areas
* stepping aside to semi-enclosed / blocked areas when you want to use your phone
* conceding the shade to elderly / infirm pedestrians
* etc etc

You are why the city still runs on time even when the trains are unpredictable. Cheers Good on the good people. I will say though, if I’m all the way over to the right and you’re walking the opposite way right at me, I ain’t moving  I would like to add that while everyone is entitled to walk at their own pace, if you're going to meander slowly down the sidewalk, at least walk in a straight fucking line so people can easily move around you. Please add "remove your backpack that is stuffed and sticks out 2 feet when you get on a crowded subway". * speeding up or slowing down to get in single file when walking with someone to let folks by
* Not hugging the corner on a left turn
* Slowing down to wait a little for a passing opportunity so as not interfere with the flow of oncoming traffic
* Not insisting on passing to the right of oncoming walkers if they are not as mobile or with kids
* For guys, speeding up to pass a woman so she doesn't feel uncomfortable that you are walking behind her for too long/following her And thanks in advance to everyone who realizes you don’t need to swing your arms like you’re running the 100 meters.  Down with excessive arm-swinging! . As someone considerate of others, you're welcome and thank you for doing the same. I agree with all of the above and it saddens me that they are not common sense that are shared by everyone.  Just got back from Germany. While I envy their transit system need to say saw seats given up for kids, tourists, and a pregnant lady this morning. While that should be a no brainer seemed automatic, nyers get a bad rap in that way.  you're welcome. My instinct, as an Aussie, is to keep left but I've been actively trying to keep right which GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING IN MY BEING.

Sydney is similar to NYC in the sense that you just keep moving.  There is similar etiquette in that sense. sometimes I pull in my shoulder because some big asshole needs to take up 1.5x his space and will bump into me otherwise. yeah we get it you're macho and want to make me curl in my shoulder, if that's how you get your pride you must not have anything else going on - Sullenly walking up the middle of the sidewalk and not budging a millimeter for anyone.

- Deliberately strolling in front of cars who have the light.

- Slamming oneself down in a subway seat and spreading one's legs into contact with one's neighbors, who shrink away.

Ring any bells? I think some people lack empathy or any awareness at all they are inconveniencing others, as in its not intentional, it just doesn’t cross their mind.

Then there are the ones who know they are being assholes but want to feel some power and joy by making you and others move out of their way or have to be inconvenienced by them.

Both suck ass and add to the daily negatives of getting around the city. >holding plastic bags in front/behind you in busy areas

Has anyone else been on wide sidewalks without much traffic and plenty of room gotten grief and comments from people because you were carrying a bag to the side?
 I’m over 6ft, people need to get out of my fucking way > Not insisting on passing to the right of oncoming walkers if they are not as mobile or with kids

My list has "Not insisting on passing to the right of oncoming walkers if they are not as mobile or with kids" for the exceptions to that rule.  Also if they are window shopping they probably deserve a pass, too. except not in a straight line down the middle so there's no space on either side Barring disability, they are as entitled to walk slowly as I would be to drive on the streets of their town at 5 mph.  And when they turn around it hits someone's face or phone. Are you fucking hiking through the R train? Take that shit off. That is one of my biggest subway pet peeves - especially when that dam backpack is jamming into your back or periodically swinging around and hitting you. People who stand in front of the doors on the subway car and refuse to move for people getting on/off should be rounded up and shipped to Siberia You know, as someone who's only been here for 2 years, I make sure to do this all the time ever since I saw a big argument over one person's backpack in a crowded 6 train. Now I'm amazed how many people, who are obviously locals, do not do this and could not give a rat's ass.  This is a complicated issue for me. I try to do it whenever possible, but on extremely crowded trains where I'm forced to stand in the vestibule by the doors and have to move around every time people get on and off, then I have to pick up the backpack too, and that's caused all kinds of issues with people tripping over it. I'll also say I'm vertically challenged so I've never even come close to whanging people in the face. Especially while holding a long umbrella at your side, especially while walking up subway stairs.  Are you implying disabled people are free to drive as slow as they want? * False Well, taking the R does feel like a slow journey at times... the flip side is moving aside, stepping out the car, and having the door close in your face because the departing passengers took their sweet time exiting the car. No, but they can walk as slowly as they need to. 

Walking and driving are two different things, but NYC sidewalks are essentially "roads" and people using them need to be more thoughtful about their road manners. When you explain the analogy to visitors, you can watch the lightbulb go on.  This has happened to you before? Yes I understand the analogy. My comment was a joke that clearly didn’t land what i was describing was not merely a hypothetical situation, so yes.
