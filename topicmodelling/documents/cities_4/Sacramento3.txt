If someone knows this guy, please kick him in the nuts for me  I would, but he would sue me. I don't understand how he's getting away with this. He was audited and he's not in jail for lying to the courts? Judges KNOW that he's gaming the system yet he's able to continue with these frivolous lawsuits? What? I don't even...? >Despite official threats and stern language, Singh has never been charged with a crime, something that Steven Finley, his longtime adversary, finds astonishing.

Me too Steven, me too. This is worse than the idiot that goes around suing for ADA discrimination.   [deleted] Could we, in theory, launch a lawsuit against him for abusing our local legal system?

I'm no lawyer, but Google tells me there is something called "vexatious litigant". That sounds lawyer-y. This guy makes me sick. I've been fighting for my social security benefits for 4 years now. I didn't know being an asshole was a disability. Gotta redo my application! [deleted] Everyone needs to stop picking on my dad.  This guy was supposedly in $6 million worth of pain and suffering for being asked to pay $46 monthly condo membership dues. I think he might just claim "$infinity" in damages for a kick in the nuts.  I feel like if I were to lie on court documents I would end up with fines and and ton of bullshit throw in my face. Yet this guy does it on what seems to be a monthly basis using different name on initial reports then changing them later on, and still roams around the town like he owns the damn place. I hate to see this type of stuff where I live. I was just going to type this. I remember that was the same guy that shut down the original Squeeze Inn, and a crap ton of other places.  Wait I could be doing this professionally?!?!? YOU ALL OWE ME MONEY! He was already labeled as such, but has found ways around it.  Hound the sac district attorney and the local us attorney general to file criminal charges against him. Then we would become another Singh. There's always another way. Huh. I know plenty of cheats of all races; I doubt there is a larger percentage in the Sikh community than in other groups.

Unless there's some actual data behind this statement, it's nothing but racism. >Sounds racist

Actually it is racist.   > A guy like this just adds to the growing stereotype of the thieving bandit turban-wearing pro-terrorist.

The reason why what you're saying sounds racist, is because it **is** racist. You're basing your judgements of what you say you know about 2 families in Yuba City doing the same thing. Pretty small sample size to state that you're "getting very tired of this kind of behavior from the **Sikh  community**.

I know of 2 white families doing the same thing in Sacramento. FUCKING THIEVING WHITE TRASH, IN-BRED, MAYO-LOVING, DIPSHITS! And sorry I probably spelled Sikh wrong. I've seen it spelled so many different ways so many different times I'm just going with this spelling because it looks totally Metal, which is cool. No offense meant. WAT.....you have more information on this? I always thought the original Squeeze Inn location was moved simply cause they got more popular and saw the strip on Power Inn being built, thus seizing the opportunity. There is a guy that haunts the Sacto (and other) court systems with dozens/hundreds of ADA suits.  He himself is in a wheelchair and considers it his job to go to Mom and Pop businesses, note a minor infraction and sue the crap out of the business.  These suits cause huge expenses for these small business folks.


The infractions can be extremely minor.  


He does not care as he gets paid no matter what.


Squeeze Inn had a perfectly acceptable solution to anyone in a wheelchair or other disability.  They could place an order and the employee would walk the food out to their car.


Not good enough for this scumbag.  He demanded that Squeeze Inn completely remodel their restaurant in order to "accommodate" him.


Squeeze Inn, knowing that the remodel would be in all practical purposes, impossible, gave in, paid him off, closed the place and moved.



He could not have cared less, he got paid.

 [Here you go](http://overlawyered.com/2009/07/sacramentos-squeeze-inn-hit-with-ada-suit/). I really hope those sexual harassment lawsuits against him are not frivolous and he gets a taste of his own medicine. That guy is the worst The original Squeeze Inn was much more important than some wheelchario douche. What a fucking loser. Same guy also got an indoor basketball place shutdown in Rancho and Ford's Real Hamburgers, as well.

http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/09/30/landmark-calif-burger-joint-forced-to-shut-down-over-ada-lawsuit/ Squeeze Inn got sold to an investment group headed by Guy Fierri ( sp? ) last I heard. The new locations, one in Roseville, good, but just not the same, not quite as good. It never will be the same. Remember the chili that was only available during hunting season? Do they still blanch fries first and keep them in an ice water bucket so they explode into crispy deliciousness? I'll never forget the original Squeeze Inn, nor the asshole who sued it into corporate homogenization.  The scumyness just keeps on coming from this asshole doesn't it? He recently got a restaurant in Folsom that I had been wanting to try shut down too. I didn't know it wasn't wheelchair accessible. As a wheelchair user myself, would I have of been upset that they did not have the accommodations that I require? You bet your ass. But 1993 really wasn't that long ago and accessibility for the disabled has really come a long way in such a short period of time. I find it very frustrating and irritating when pre-ADA era buildings haven't been upgraded but I'm most certainly not going to sue someone. I'm not even gonna file as complaint about it!

Why does one man get "paid off" when it's something that affects an entire group of people? And how does punishing a business owner make the situation any better for people with disabilities? There has to be some middle ground where the business owner doesn't have to close his business and assholes can't going around suing everyone because they know they can make an easy buck. What you see as a bug in the ADA law is actually a built in feature.  The ADA was written to specifically allow assholes like this to do exactly what he is doing.


He is simply exploiting a part of the law as written.

He isn't wrong, he's just an asshole (insert pic of the Dude here).
