Transportation options for disabled I broke my right leg a few weeks back and need to get get back to work starting next week(Greenwood -> Pioneer Square). I wont be able to put any weight on it for the next couple of months so was wondering if anybody here has any advice regarding transportation.

I should be able to use the E-line eventually  but was looking for any private transportation company(anything less expensive then uber) that can pick me up from my apt in the morning and drop me to work and vice versa for the first month.

Any suggestion or advice will be greatly appreciated Metro Access vans,  possibly?  all metro buses are able to accommodate electric wheelchairs. 

I gotta imagine renting an electric wheelchair for two months is going to be cheaper than paying for door-to-door transportation 2x a day, 5 days a week for the next 8 weeks. I'm not sure about private transportation companies, but the 5 or 355 might be a little more convenient to your apartment than the E?

Good luck. A carpool website, such as [this](http://www.carpoolworld.com/carpool_.html?to=Seattle&state=WA&country=USA,US&form_language=EN) or [this](http://www.rideshareonline.com/) might be the way to go. There are a lot of people who commute between Greenwood and Pioneer Square, someone may take you up on splitting the expenses for a month. My son is in a wheelchair and we use Hopelink. But that's for doctors appointments only, so this probably won't help much. PM me and I'll give you some contacts. I work in exactly this field,but I'm not sure which contractor I work with has the lowest private rate. 

Edit- wait, less expensive than UBER??  I would not rely on Access to get to work unless your job is unusually flexible.
They generally have a fairly broad window of arrival/ departure.
Probably better off renting a wheelchair and taking the bus if you are desperate: Yeah, I'd expect that to be about a 30$ trip each way on NEMT, $50 if you require a wheelchair lift. Probably more expensive for a private party, perhaps significantly.  Not to mention the application process can take multiple weeks, possibly longer than OP's recovery time.
