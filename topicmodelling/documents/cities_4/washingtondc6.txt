Injured Turtle Gets Lego Wheelchair at Maryland Zoo  A lot of negative news recently (murders, politics, etc.) so I just wanted to share a story that made me smile Maryland driver! ;) 

He is lovely though. I like Legos and turtles “They drew up some plans and sent them to a lego enthusiast...” aka a beast Now he can make it to the water Thank you — this is 100% smile worthy do you like dressing up as a zombie?
