Flushing Wheelchair Wonder? I was wondering if any other girls had come across this guy in a wheelchair around 162nd St. or the LIRR station (Broadway) in Flushing?  Apparently he's a decent looking white guy who wears these EXTREMELY tight pants and you can't help but notice that he usually seems to have an extremely large "endowment."  LOL.  Apparently he likes to ask girls what time it is and what they think of his pants.  It sounds completely crazy to me by my friend said this happened to her and to some other girls in the neighborhood.  Apparently he's not dangerous.  I guess he just wants them to see what's going on there LOL

Has anyone else come across this guy?  I'm kind of curious myself.  My friend said it looked huge LOL LOL This post was *definitely* not posted by the guy in a wheelchair trying to draw attention to himself.
