Woman in wheelchair hit by a car running stop sign in East Liberty  I work by here and pass through this intersection every day and I'm constantly seeing people plow through those stop signs. The other day a man almost hit me, started cussing and I pointed at the stop sign and he sunk into his seat. 
I thought things would get better because they just painted white stop lines on the road. Its an odd intersection because it is so wide, feels like everyone around you is at a great distance and its easy to just stare off at the long lane in front of you. 
Lights probably need to go up here.   This is a prime example of why, when walking around with friends, it's annoying that they give me shit for looking both ways when "we already have the right of way".  Holy shit, this should definitely be marked NSFW. 

>Police said the driver temporarily left the scene of the accident but returned once officers arrived

People are such garbage. For those curious, Here is all that he is being charged with: 
Class 2 Felony, class 3 felony, a misdemeanor and a couple summary offenses.

Also $3000 bail seems a little low to me.... Can't wait for self-driving cars.  I see the downvote fairy has graced this thread with it's presence.  Buzz off. it clearly her fault maybe if she and all the other wheelchair riders followed the laws she wouldnt have been hit. /s [Here is an additional story from WPXI](http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/woman-wheelchair-struck-vehicle-east-liberty/nnnJs/) There is a nice woman who lives near me in the Southside and uses one of those scooters to get around. She always has a young girl alongside her, not sure if it's her daughter or grand daughter... I really hope this isn't them.   Drivers need to be retested every four years. Fucking Baum, it seems like every jerkass drives on it like its the Fucking Turnpike. They could start running red light cameras (on those that are light controlled, at least) but I come from a place with thousands of those, and I don't think they'd stop this kind of accident. 

If you're distracted or drunk (I think both are absolutely irresponsible) you're going to do this at some point. 

Part of the problem is that people do not respect the physical aspects of driving; they've forgotten what it is to propel a tonne of steel around at what are very high speeds. They're passengers, not pilots. 

The auto makers themselves have done a lot to encourage it, with deceptively comfortable ride quality and lots of toys on the dash.  Been watching the local news at work and they keep pausing the video before the accident.  Is the full video somewhere? People in here need to stop conversing with /u/farbtoner420. It is an obvious troll account. Yet for some reason I see people arguing with him/her all the time.  Update:  the driver has been identified if anyone is interested

http://www.wtae.com/news/woman-on-scooter-hit-by-car-in-east-liberty/35472958 Thrown in jail and wages garnished?  That's a little harsh for an accident. Lights are the proper response. Or a cop stationed there on a semi permanent basis. I walk this intersection every day and literally today (just found out about this story today) someone blew this stop sign right in front of me. Really shitty drivers around here. I also still look both ways when crossing one way streets. I've seen too many people going the wrong way down one-ways. I'm with you.  I don't care if I have the "right of way", I'm still going to lose a battle with a vehicle even if the driver was 100% wrong.  Doesn't matter if you were in the right, you're now dead. That reminds of my dearest's assertion that crossing traffic "...has a stop sign" as if a metal post has special properties that prevent cars from roaring through.  After watching the footage in it's entirety, I totally see why the news outlets were cutting it off before impact. Awful. No charge for leaving the scene of the accident? I thought that carried a hefty penalty, and don't give a shit if the guy 'came back once police arrived.' As stated elsewhere, bail is related to flight risk and level of assets.  Bail should never be set higher than a person can pay or it defeats the purpose.  It should either be a level that will convince the person to return for court or if there is too great a flight risk period, it should not be offered as an option.  But there is no benefit to keeping someone in jail pretrial unless you are concerned about them showing up at the trial. Whose fault is it when a self-driving car runs someone over?   I've been noticing this for a while, at first I thought it was mostly a downvote spree on anything politically contentious.  However there's something else going on here, because I've begun to notice completely benign and/or helpful posts being downvoted to the point of being hidden for no apparent reason. Sometimes I wonder if there are people who work in real estate/PR who automatically down vote anything painting the east in a bad light. This sub reddit is pretty popular and is the prime demographic that is the city is looking to attract (young professionals). There has been speculation that this type of stuff goes on at city-data too. 

Kinda crazy.  Were we hit by SRS or something? or maybe /r/cars? They should use those damn wheelchair lanes Pa-dewd-oh insisted on installing all across dahntahn.
 I guarantee most will pass; they will then continue to blow lights and stop signs because this is a learned behaviour. 
 Most of the problems you see on the roads have nothing to do with competency or skills.  People know what they're supposed to do in order to pass a driving test, they just behave differently in their day to day driving. If that driver was a bit more aggressive this could've been avoided. [deleted] Are you kidding?  Half the yinzers here would fail the second they stopped on an on-ramp!
 click the article title, it'll take you to a FB post by a nearby business owner that captured it on surveillance.  Be prepared, it's pretty hard to watch. When did "Unsafe drivers should be prevented from killing people" become a troll opinion?  Driver was apparently drunk. "Accident" isn't a fair characterization of this sort of incident. It's a driver's responsibility to pay attention to their surroundings, and shirking it should have heavy consequences. Accidents are typically caused by negligence/carelessness of one of the involved parties. It's September, there is no snow or ice, and the cause is not said to be a mechanical problem. And because the signs are facing away, they just BLAST through intersections. Leaving the scene is charge 2, [3742(a)](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/75/00.037.042.000..HTM)

> _The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury or death of any person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close thereto as possible but shall then forthwith return to and **in every event shall remain at the scene of the accident until he has fulfilled the requirements of section 3744** (relating to duty to give information and render aid)._ Yeah I don't know why the DA didn't try to tack that on there. There is a good chance it would stick. I doubt he will qualify for the first time DUI offenders program. Its not really made for people that run over other people in their cars while drunk.  IMO reducing those incidents is much more important that knowing who to blame. Whose fault is it when some other kind of mechanical failure causes an accident? Skynet?  Yes





But seriously I think having footage from every side of the car will help sort that out (if you havent seen footage from when Google's cars crash into someone it's generally always the other persons fault and the car has proof of it). If it is the car's fault, since you have no control over its trajectory and speed (presumably) it would be foolish to say the person in the car is at fault. Which is why these cars need to be basically flawless when they come out IMO Right? Pretty sure somebody has been downvoting my entire comment history lol. I mean I know I am an asshole but damn.  Same. Something fucky is going on. I rarely post on c-d nowadays.  It's changed a lot in the last year or so, many older posters who were *great* have just disappeared. Too many arguments and snark now. it's possible.  Every post that wasn't involved in the hidden one got downvoted within minutes of being posted.  Sometimes people that visit this board hand those votes out like candy in front of a playground and it gets super annoying when people are simply posting a neutral comment lol. "Revoke the licenses of people who injure or kill others with their car" is a really unpopular opinion.  SRS wouldn't brigade this sub. You're probably just noticing Reddits vote fuzzing algorithm at work. Hey hey. Don't drag SRS into this! It's absolutely an issue of competence. A person who thinks it's okay to drive while distracted is not competent to drive.  Driving is a privilege, not a right. It's pretty clear that mass abuse of that privilege has been happening for a long time.  oh man, yinzerjagoff is from shaler.  i love it.   Good.  thx cmc Yeah, no idea. I agreed with most of what you wrote.

We should at the least have cameras at every intersection and police that actually enforce traffic laws instead of running around fucking with black people. Oh ok, yeah fuck that guy. This is why there is a push for usage of the term "collision".  It doesn't imply any specific fault but it doesn't let anyone off the hook either. Gotcha, thanks! Ah gotcha it was cut off in the docket and I was too lazy to google the full statute  yea I'm pretty sure that is reserved for people who don't cause bodily harm/property damage Tell that to a company who might be liable. [deleted] Way of the road bubs. I don't post, but it's fun to lurk sometimes since civic stuff is interesting to me.  Oh I just scream at them "you're not allowed to hit people you don't like with your car" and laugh about how upset that makes them. I live near a crosswalk that I use daily and drivers down the road will get upset, honk and scream, because they had to watch you walk in front of their car and didn't even have to slow down. Lol what? I've been brigaded by them here before. Normal comments suddenly negative forty karma. You think the fuzzing algorithm puts stuff into the negative? That's still not something that is going to be revealed by retesting.

Even idiots who text and drive know not to do it while the PennDOT examiner is sitting in the seat next to them. [deleted] it was the clue i needed. it's matt s isn't it? You got my vote!  Less idiots on the roads the better!
 "enforce traffic laws instead of running around fucking with black people."  
They'll still be fucking around with black people... Seriously though, even if that man was sober, he nearly killed (and most definitely severely complicated the life of) a person and a child in broad daylight through shear recklessness.

In any other context we'd unanimously be demanding blood. This isn't a "whoopsie" 5mph rolling stop mistake, he was going damn well fast enough to throw her 30 feet out off her chair. He seriously broke the law, and now a person's life is ruined because of this asshole being in a hurry and his car. I hope he never gets to drive again. Those are some pretty serious charges though. I suppose they didn't see him as a flight risk, but that bail seems way too low.  [deleted] Do you have any examples of this happening? I'd like to see if I agree and if there's any thing I can do to help and or explain what I think is going on. Another guy in this very thread is saying that I'm a troll and to not respond to me. If you seriously think that "be a safe driver", "be courteous to others while driving," and "don't kill anyone with your car" are troll opinions, your head is super fucked up and you've proven everything I've ever said about the toxic car culture in this area.  Or maybe people here don't like what you have to say Yeah.  I drove like a saint during my test.  Day to day?  I have no qualms about rocketing off an on-ramp. I shouldn't have to pay for your poor choices (having a car dependent lifestyle) by putting my life on the line every time I step out my front door.  If people are incapable of driving without being a danger to others, they should have their privilege revoked.  If that would make it hard for them to get to work, that's their problem; they broke the law and put others at risk.  Agreed. I've always been curious how they determine that. I can already see the 60 minutes.  

"So you're telling me that your cars ran people over?  And you expect the American public to accept that?"


   [deleted] You have down votes following you around because you're a shit stirrer and everyone is tired of you.  No one is saying those specifically are troll opinions, but you are clearly a troll, because the solutions you've suggested are obviously not feasible, you rant constantly against drivers as if you're unaware that most families literally require a car, and you refuse to be drawn into any kind of reasonable discussion about how to improve the situation. All you can say is "RETEST EVERYONE ALL THE TIME!!!!" and then get angry when it's pointed out that doesn't solve any problems. That's not how you're supposed to use votes outside of SRS. Relying on an automobile like the vast majority of America is a poor life choice? Man are you condescending.  [deleted] Have a car dependent lifestyle = living in America. Sorry. I think its based mostly on flight risk/assets. Looks like this guy owns a house and has a wife, and no other criminal record, so they assumed he would stay put for court.  You should let them stay. I've seen things at 0 rebound. Different crowds read at different times of day.

Also, I've also seen otherwise decent posts fail:

 * because of bad headlines.
 * because they're posted at slow times of day

Next time it happens, let me know. Those shit-stirring controversial opinions like "Don't kill people with your car," "public transit is good," and "McRib is back."  The three people you're saying is "everyone" have issues.  No one is angry here except you. The only interest I have is in seeing less pedestrians needlessly hurt or killed. If that means irresponsible drivers need to lose their license, so be it.  Hello,  I'm a VERY aggressive driver from Europe and I agree with U/Farbtoner420's opinion!  How Aggressive am I?  I learned to drive in Lisbon and I use to live in Philly and work in NY and DC.  I like driving.  I own a track car and race it on the track.  It's fun.

But I've seen some of the worst drivers here in Pittsburgh!  And the reality is some people, even me, do need a brush up on the safety side of things.  

Remember Driving is a privilege, not a right!  Does owning a car help a family?  Yes,  can you lose your right to drive for a DUI?  Yes.  

Remember, you are in control of a vehicle that weights 3000-4000lbs that can travel at over 60mph?  You need to keep it under-control.  

  And seriously, some folks do need to be retested.   People do that in every subreddit. The world doesn't work the way its "supposed to". If you have chosen to rely on an automobile for your every day life when you can't even figure out how a stop sign works, then yes, you have made a poor life choice and you need to have your license revoked for the safety of others.  Serious injury or death because people don't pay attention is no laughing matter, friend.  Then make retesting mandatory and remove people who won't follow the law from the road, instead of just throwing our hands in the air and saying "all these deaths and injuries are necessary if we want to live in America!" i, for one, am very pleased that the mcrib has returned. for what it's worth I enjoy your posts, FT Europe is not America.  [removed] [deleted] No one is saying "all these deaths and injuries are necessary if we want to live in America!" What we're saying is that, in America, driving is much more of a right than a privilege. Maybe in 50 years, when we've adapted to modern urban planning and mass transit standards, we can start talking about making drivers licenses harder to get. But to suggest that today, when the most peoples' livelihoods and ability to support themselves and their families is dependent on having a car, is absolutely childish and asinine. It's about time Pittsburgh had some good barbecue.  You're a fine individual! You're right, America is way more dangerous. I'm saying to retest drivers. If not every four years, at least every decade. People who run stop signs as a matter of course shouldn't be driving.  What's my agenda?  Driving is a privilege, not a right. If it were a right, it wouldn't require training and licensing. 

  
The point of licensing is to make sure that people who aren't qualified to exercise the privilege, don't. A lot of people out there on our roads aren't qualified to be there and should be retested for the safety of others.  Sure, whatever, that's not my point. Cars are *much* more essential in America than they are in Europe. His comparison is pointless. And you can't simply say "well we need to make licenses harder to get/keep" without accepting the impact that has on many people's ability to support themselves. You think these people are going to run stop signs in their driving test? Get over yourself. These are bad ideas born of frustrated and childish anger. Sorry we're not all cyclists and thus inherently superior.  [deleted] Owning a gun is a right (according to the constitution) and it requires training and licensing. Both are deadly objects and are meant to be operated deliberately whilst sober. What's the difference? Grow up. So since when is NY, DC, and Philly not in America.  Oh wait, you can't read.  Never mind.  You seem really mad at the idea of basic safety standards like retesting drivers.  What harm does it do to you if we retest people to make sure they're still qualified to drive?  
&nbsp;  
(And yes, people can and do run stop signs during driver's tests.) The only agenda I have is to see a crackdown on reckless drivers. They are everywhere in this area and they don't take their responsibilities seriously. This is two pedestrians hit (one killed) this week already. Something drastic needs to be done so that drivers take their responsibilities seriously, and so that drivers who refuse to take their responsibility seriously can be removed from the road.  

I'm not sure why that's an "agenda." It seems like common sense to me.  I can't drive my gun to the Home Depot and pick up a load of plywood, duh?  Automobile crashes are the number one cause of death in this county for people 18-35. To suggest that this is cool and good and should continue is childish and asinine. Grow up.  You listed three cities. You listed the three cities in the entirety of the US that have Europe-esque mass transit. What do you think this proves, exactly? It's a massive expense and inconvenience and few people would actually fail. The people who are out there not paying attention and running stop signs aren't going to make those same mistakes during an organized driving test. Again, you're being childish and illogical. This would accomplish nothing, and treating all drivers like criminals in a country where most people HAVE to drive to live is just unfathomably stupid.  No one is saying that. You're being a big fucking baby just because no one agrees with your bad ideas.  That you are a moron that failed geography and history.   Driving is a privilege, not a right. If people are abusing that privilege, it needs to be revoked for the safety of others. You seem to think its cool and good to shrug and say "shucks, that's just how it is in America, we can't do anything about it!"  That's incredibly fucked up.  What you're saying is that things are fine as they are. They clearly aren't. If shitty drivers won't follow the law, get them off the road before they do what happened to this poor woman.  Go fuck yourself.  [removed] No, I'm saying that your solution wouldn't fix these problems. No thanks, that's your mom's job.  Please be civil (even when someone is being an asshole.) By shouting down suggestions on how to improve safety, that's exactly what you're saying. That you're fine with it. 
I've been hit by drivers running a stop. Give me a call when it happens to you or one of your loved ones.  Then what would?  [deleted] [removed] Increase police patrols/enforcement would be a good start. As I've explained to you 3-4 times, retesting these people accomplishes nothing. They already know you're not supposed to run stop signs. They do it because they're lazy or not paying attention. Use your common sense and understand that they **will not** make those same mistakes in a driving test when they know a person with the ability to take their license away is looking over their shoulder. It does not replicate reality and it does not accurately measure their abilities as a driver. The only way to do that is to more harshly punish people who make these mistakes. This is a good post, but signage in particular is a problem already. A civil engineer I know said that they were trying to get away from signage because drivers are overloaded by it to the point where they shut it out and ignore it.   [removed] People make mistakes in driving tests all the time. What you're saying here doesn't make any sense. 

Retest drivers every ten years and suspend licenses for a period of six months for any offense involving ignoring traffic control devices. That's a good start.  [removed] >People make mistakes in driving tests all the time. 

In no way does that make my point untrue. You're going to catch, very, very few of these mistakes. It's a waste of time and money.

>What you're saying here doesn't make any sense.

Yes it does. You're just refusing to listen because you're a useless piece of shit who won't admit when he's wrong. This entire sub hates you. Maybe blame yourself for once instead of everyone else. Then don't retest but make the penalties for breaking the law draconian.  Base speeding tickets on percentage of net worth or income. Suspend licenses for six months for ignoring traffic control devices. Revoke licenses for striking a pedestrian. 

None of the enforcement options will do any good without enforcement, though. Police here don't enforce anything. They'll come after the accident, but they don't give a shit what you do until an accident happens.  Finally you have figured out what the *real* problem is. Thank you. Changing speeding fines is a good idea, afaik some countries (Sweden, probably) already do this. I think we also need to work on resetting speed limits to more reasonable levels - that means reducing some, but yes, increasing others. Areas where speed limits are too low cause drivers to habitually speed, which gives them the impression that they can speed everywhere, which inherently undermines the police's ability to enforce speeding penalties.

You have to see the big picture, and you have to realize that we're *always* going to live in a country where a lot of people drive. You need to adapt your solutions to that reality instead of trying to change reality.

E: But failing to signal should result in capital punishment. Fuck those people. I never said "take cars away."  I said "take cars away from people who can't operate them responsibly." And then you suggested an ineffective way to determine that, because  - for the 30th time - people operate cars differently in driving tests than they do in the real world. You simply **will not** catch these people.
