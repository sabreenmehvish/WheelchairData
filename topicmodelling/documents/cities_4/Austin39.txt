Where can I donate a brand new wheelchair? I'm in So. Congress area and I want to donate a brand new wheelchair that wasn't used. Does anyone know a good organization nearby that could use it? http://ageofcentraltx.org/help.php Lions Club, Christopher House, VA, any nursing home I'll take it so I can sell it to pay off my medical debt
