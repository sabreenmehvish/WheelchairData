When life gives you wheelchair, make lemonade. Austinite currently in 1st place to win a show on Oprah's network. Let's help him win.   Don't vote for him because he's from Austin, vote for him because he's awesome. This guy is from Austin? I want to meet him! Vote for him if you're going to request the OWN network from your cable provider and watch his show; not if you just feel like spamming a web poll today.

That said, I watched the top 4 entries and ended up voting for Zach. Is this the first time you've been on reddit in a couple of weeks? But also because Austin almost rhymes with awesome.  They are in fact stepbrothers.
