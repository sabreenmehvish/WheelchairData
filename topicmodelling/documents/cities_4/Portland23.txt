Parking this bad has no excuse :(  Walmart... enough said. Well, obviously, they're mentally handicapped.  Did you check the dash for drumsticks? *aisle. Driving on the spare too? Damn  You do know that it's really icy and cold out, right? That means all idiocy is forgiven. Parked in a handicap space with no permit, not plates, part in the space, part in the isle. If you drive this badly maybe you should not be driving.  Thx California Thanks. I suck at speling.  other side had a matching spare.  Nope. Wrong!!! No doubt that this is a crappy parking job but I think they actually have a handicap parking placard* hanging in the window. Maybe OP can confirm?

*On behalf of those of us who have handicap parking placards/plates... not all of us fail to understand proper parking.

EDIT: Blah blah words blah blah clarity

EDIT 2: Okay, you are OP. So... yeah. This person just sucks. As a wheelchair user who very much relies on these spots... fuck that guy. As someone who knows how to park... fuck that guy twice. Spare, or possibly snow tires? There were two air fresheners hanging off the rear-view mirror but not a handicap permit. I looked before I snapped the photo.  I thoroughly applaud you for documenting this.

I have been disabled from birth and have used a wheelchair since I was a teenager. I am able to drive and I see people regularly abuse handicapped parking spaces and when I try to, firmly but politely, point out what they've done, they just lose it and get super defensive and aggressive. You're helping me to feel less alone and marginalized at a time when those feelings are very strong. I owe you a beer if we should ever encounter each other in real life. Real life? I have to go outside for that right? That is what I hear, yes. I can try and send a carrier pigeon to you but I'm not sure how much weight they can sustain. Maybe one of those African swallows? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liIlW-ovx0Y
