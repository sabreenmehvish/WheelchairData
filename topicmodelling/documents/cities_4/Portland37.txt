Wheelchair accessible trails Where in the Portland metro area are there some trails that are wheelchair friendly? And also accessible via trimet.

I've never been hiking or anything of the sort, and would love to do it before summer is over. 

Thank you.  Lower Macleay at Forest Park. Only a short distance is paved but designed specifically for ADA. Take a Blue Line MAX to Merlo/SW 158th, and across from the platform take the paved trail into the [Tualatin Hills Nature Park](http://www.thprd.org/parks-and-trails/detail/tualatin-hills-nature-park) - some of the trails in there are paved and specifically wheelchair accessible.  I'm not exactly sure what a wheelchair- friendly trail is (not being a smartass, just not a hiker or in a wheelchair), but [Mt. Tabor Park](http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?PropertyID=275&action=ViewPark) is accessible via Trimet and you can get to the top without having to utilize dirt or stairs. It's not the wilderness, but it is beautiful (and peaceful on a weekday) and seems like it might fit your situation. I hope you find what you are looking for. Tryon Creek has a paved trail that is wheelchair friendly.  [Link](http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=main.loadFile&load=_siteFiles/publications/tryon_map.pdf) (pdf warning). If I remember correctly, the trail to the summit of Powell Butte is paved. There are paved trails at Smith and Bybee Lakes that lead to covered bird watching platforms. It's pretty lame in the summer but a great spot for drizzly fall days.  This. It's a very nicely maintained wheelchair-appropriate trail that even goes over a bridge (or two?). Nice pretty trail. It is? I haven't been up there in a while and I don't remember that. But it's cool if it is! Yes, it is.

Well, the main one from the highest parking lot is.
