There is no hope for you if you steal from a disabled kid ... on a make-a-wish trip ... to WrestleMania... from Ireland  You're a special kind of asshole to steal from a kid in a wheelchair. Glad that it worked out for them.  That's so wrong :( I wish the news story would publish more info on the camera.  If it pops up on craigslist we could do something. After spending three days serving drinks to the wrestling crowd, I cannot say I'm surprised that one of these assholes would steal from someone who is disabled.  3 cheers to Lakeside whatever whoever for donating a new camera. 

+1 there is a special place in hell for these people... Wow.

Just wow.

Unfortunately I'm just not even surprised. Awww man, I took pictures of this kid and his father with Jim Duggan at the Axxess Wrestlemania. They were so nice and the father was so appreciative of everything. This fucking sucks. Someone should put this on /r/rbi and see what people come up with. It would be awesome if someone found the card at least. I've bought cameras that still have photos from previous owners at pawn shops before, there's still hope. The ending...


*The feels* Called a guy at the news station last night to see if there was anything else that could be done. He said it was a Canon EOS 600d. The crime infuriates me to no end. Stories? How were the tips? See if you can send your pics to them, I'm sure they'd appreciate it! Well I can't say I noticed anything that was really interesting. They all just stood around in groups and chanted the same things over and over for hours on end. Literally. They also played the same songs on repeat all night. I must of heard Cult of Personality (by some random 90s band) 40 times in the last two days. I'm assuming that must be some wrestlers theme music or whatever because they lost their god damn minds every time it was played. I'd say average to above average.
