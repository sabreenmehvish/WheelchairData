Oroville, the movie Ok, in all seriousness. I hope everyone affected by this gets through it with minimal damage and stress. My wife's grandma (who's blind and in a wheelchair) was moved from Live Oak to Auburn last night, and we just found out this morning where her actual location was. So I understand this is no joke. But since I'm a bad person who uses humor to cope with negativity... I can't help but think in 5 years they will make a movie based on this event. Probably starring Dwayne Johnson or Mark Wahlberg. Featuring great character actors like Bill Paxton, John Goodman, and JK Simmons. Meh, I'll wait for the remake.  mehh,  I was thinking it'd be more along the lines of a mellow drama.   And for some reason, I image it being on Lifetime; maybe cause that's the type of movie I'm thinking of.   Maybe some b-list actors, definitely give Danny Trejo a part,  for sure Matt Walsh,  possibly Julia Styles  Cast Nic Cage and I'm in...  Directed by Michael Bay Nic Cage and Danny Glover
