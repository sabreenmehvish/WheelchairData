Wheelchair Rental for the week Heading to Vegas this week and meeting up with parents. What are the chances anyone knows about renting a wheelchair for the week (11-17) while we're there.

(x-post from /r/LasVegas on recommendation)  J and B Mobility. 702-413-6350. That's my company, just tell me this is where you came from and I would be happy to give you a good deal. Ask for George.  A friend got one [here](http://www.lasvegaswheelchairs.com/products/heavyscooters.html) a few years back. He had it delivered to his hotel (Rio) about an hour before he checked in. Ran him $150 for a week for a heavy duty electric scooter. He does recommend that you plug in for a recharge whenever you have an opportunity. Thanks for the comment - I'll try to give you a call tomorrow afternoon.
