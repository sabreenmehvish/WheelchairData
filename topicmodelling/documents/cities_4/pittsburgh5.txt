Veteran's wheelchair basketball clinic - Thursday 3/16  The Pittsburgh Steelwheelers wheelchair basketball team is having a Veteran's clinic on Thursday night at Bellefield Hall. We could use help spreading the word to any disabled vets that may like to join to try out the sport.

https://www.facebook.com/events/171123516732115/ Steelwheelers is an amazing organization. A few of the guys from their wheel chair rugby team donated their time to come out and show a few of the young amputee participants at the Woodlands camp all about the sport. Very friendly and accommodating guys and it meant the world to the kids. Thanks to you guys for doing that, it was really special for them (and me as it was a really fun sport to get to try out).
