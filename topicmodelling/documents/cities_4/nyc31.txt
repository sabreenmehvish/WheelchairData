Surcharge Is Approved for Cab Fares  i thought the whole 'taxi of the future' that was replacing all cabs was wheelchair accessible and other fun stuff. is that not happening? The plan is to have 7,500 wheelchair accessible taxi cabs in NYC by 2020 with the added revenue of the 30 cent surcharge 

  Deleted, I can't read apparently I don't remember all the details of this so take what I say with a grain of salt, but the 'taxi of the future' isn't handicapped accessible, so the NYC Taxi commission got sued by disability associations and won in 2012. Getting sued again via different tactic - some ADA? reg which requires "vans" be handicapped accessible. It looks like NYC is going to lose that case because the NV200 probably fits within the definition of a "van."

So this surcharge is probably a reaction (maybe a settlement?) to that lawsuit, which NYC will probably lose. Lots of good arguments for making all taxis disability accessible - it's just very expensive, hence 30 cent surcharge.
