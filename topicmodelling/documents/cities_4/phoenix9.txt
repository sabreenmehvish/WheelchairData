Can heat make a window crack?? This may seem like a dumb question but this is my first summer in Phoenix. 
A little bit ago I heard a loud crack and got up to find that one of our windows has spiderweb cracking going up from the bottom. This window doesn't open or close, isn't in our main living area, and we have the dog's wheelchair in front of it so nothing was in a position to fall on it from the inside. We keep the A.C. around 79-80. I checked outside and didn't see any birds, and the loudness of the crack makes me think that if it was a bird, it wouldn't have flown away after that. There are no visible marks on the window outside or inside besides the crack.

When I called the apartment management, they mentioned that someone else had called with the same problem. I'm trying to figure out if this is something that might have happened because of the heat and maybe old windows, or if we have crazy neighbors running around.

I'm also not sure if this is the right place for this question, but if it is something that happens due to heat, do I have any rights when it comes to not having to pay for a replacement? I wouldn't mind the cost if it was something we caused, but this was just sudden and kind of scary. 

Thanks guys! Hope everyone has a happy 4th! There was probably a small crack or chip in it already. Last my girlfriend had her windshield chipped ever so slightly on her way to work. She had to park out in the sun that day and when she came back out, she had a long crack going halfway across the windshield. How did it break?

Tempered glass is much tougher, and even a bird smacking into it won't break it.

If there are others in the complex, it might be a kid with a new pellet gun. It can happen with the expansion of glass or the frame stressing it out but it's not very likely. There isn't a chip anywhere? I also think something may have impacted the glass. We had a shower door do that one summer. It had gotten so hot that an air bubble expanded causing the glass to shatter.  It looks like the Annealed (non-tempered) glass. I didn't even think about a pellet gun -- if it was a kid they ran away fast, though. It took me a minute to figure out the window breaking was the noise I'd heard and didn't look outside right away, by the time I did there was nothing. 
Would a pellet gun have left marks on the outside of the window? I didn't notice any chips in it previously. We've been in this apartment for a little over 6 months now and really don't use that window at all, I think this was the first time after move in I really paid attention to it. If it was an impact it was a weird one, I didn't see any marks on the window :/ Good old float glass- much easier to break.

If the shards look like it busted in the [center,](http://www.rgbstock.com/cache1rryxT/users/t/ta/tacluda/300/ngEtbCe.jpg) I would be inclined to think something struck it. If there's a nice tiny hole where the lines meet, then it's likely someone with a BB gun or pellet rifle.

Cracks [from the edge](http://chicagowindowexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/stress601.jpg) are heat-related. Come to think of it, [that entire page](http://chicagowindowexpert.com/2009/06/20/diagnosing-glass-breakage/) is pretty damned good. This is really helpful, thanks! It's cracking out from the bottom center, so seems like it's heat related. I have never seen heat actually crack glass! It's not even the hottest week we've had, super weird.
