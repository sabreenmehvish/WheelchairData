The best restaurant in New York is the American Girl Caf√©  I've been to it......twice.  It's no better than any other place and my daughter is hard on the dolls.   Meanwhile people on EBT Foodstamps are supposed to live on $180/month! Some are in a manual wheelchair, with only one side of their body working!  Are you fucking retarded?  Some are living in lofts in Bushwick while daddy pays the rent! I'm in a wheelchair, by the way, so fuck off! Bitch! How does people going to a doll cafe remotely relate to the fact that you are in a wheelchair? NYC sub has some of the most deranged posters. They're like our version of the ranting mentally ill homeless Holy crap read his posting history, you're totally right ["Last time I checked, the moon had an atmosphere of pure emptiness!
