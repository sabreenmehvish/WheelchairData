Local wheelchair bound stunt performer had his stunt chair STOLEN! Help find the chair! Wheelz is a local kid that has made a HUGE name for himself by becoming an action star, despite being bound to a wheelchair. 

But, the other day, some jerk stole his famous green wheelchair from a house near Jones and Washington while he test drove a special car designed for someone like him. 

Let's get this thing back! If you have information regarding the theft of this awesome guy's means of making an income, post something here, or on Facebook (link below).

What the hell man? Someone stole the battery right off my MIL's wheelchair when she was on a city bus here in Vegas. The extreme lows some people will go to never cease to amaze me! Man, I hate this town sometimes.  If you cannot find the chair I hope there will be a GoFund or something to help replace it.  Too bad it wasn't insured :( Yeah, and it's not like he left it in the street or anything. They took it off a driveway while he was test driving a truck he was thinking of buying. 
 Plus, the keys to his house AND truck were on it and the took those too!  
Such scum!
