At Denver Diner on Sunday after picking up my friend from the drunk tank. Then this guy cruised by  I thought he was trying to sell that thing. I swear I saw a craigslist ad for it. Yes. That is a recliner on top of an electronic wheelchair.   That dude has shit figured out.  Ranch Breakfast W/ Biscuits & Gravy Every Time. he should take that thing to a rockies game! Denver CARES? This guy needs to go on the banner.  [deleted] There's another dude roaming around 16 in a recliner. It's not as nice or noticeable as this guy, though. An I the only that thinks of Roundhouse every time I see him? I saw this guy downtown at the 4/20 rally. Are you sure that's the seller? Maybe that's the buyer... Been there once a few years back, better than real jail but still sucks.  It's a recliner on top of an electronic wheelchair. I think it's the same guy that we've seen pictures of driving it before, but who knows. It's entirely possible a similar looking older bearded man purchased it.
