Wheelchair-accessible places to see fireworks on the Fourth of July? And accessible tourist attractions?  I'll be living in Seattle this summer, and I know a few people that are interested in coming to town on the 4th to see the sights and the fireworks, etc. Their primary concern is that one of their family members has a wheel chair, so it can make it difficult for them to navigate in crowds. 

The fireworks over Lake Union are pretty spectacular (at least, I thought they were nice when I saw them last year) and it'd be a shame for them to miss them. Do you know of any good places for them to go to watch that would be wheelchair accessible? 

Also, would you be able to recommend any other touristy things / sights that they could see that would be accessible? 

Thanks! 

 Top of Queen Anne is pretty good too- the crowds are probably more manageable but traffic is horrible when it's all over (assuming you're driving). Accessibility

The Family 4th will have a special fireworks viewing area for patrons with disabilities. The viewing area opens at 6 p.m. and is located on the south side of the play barn.

Take them on the ferry or to the top of Columbia Tower. IF you want to do the market** go early.** Like when the vendors get there early. The amount of  clueless idiots that are there over the summer make it hard to navigate as an able bodied person.  The South Lake Union Park is right off the SLUT Line and is nice and flat.  But it will probably be super crowded. This is spectacular advice. Thank you so much!  Great! Thanks for the advice. (Happy cake day!)
