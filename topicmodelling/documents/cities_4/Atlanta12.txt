Drake seen at Lenox Mall in Atlanta  Drake, Gucci, and Zaytoven been chilling at the studio cooking up some new songs.  [deleted] Who? I wonder if he got some one else to write his name when he signed for his purchase  How can this guy go anywhere in public? I don't even listen to that kind of music at all and I'd still gawk at him.  What's on dudes face?? i love that store. we go to the same store.  [deleted] Smile! Jimmy, the kid in the wheelchair from Degrassi High. you could say that about a lot of things posted here.   Even though I watch TMZ pretty often, I find it odd people are surprised to see celebrities. They're people. Famous people but they do people stuff like eat and shop... Wow good for him, his legs grew He will forever be Wheelchair Jimmy to me. And actually, he was on Degrassi: The Next Generation.
