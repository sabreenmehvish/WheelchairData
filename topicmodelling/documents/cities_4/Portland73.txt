Volunteer options Hey guys, do you know of any good volunteer spots that would be good for someone in a wheelchair? I know free geek has good volunteer programs with accessibility. Maybe check them out? Check out Hands On Greater Portland. I'm a volunteer leader with them and have worked with people with disabilities on some of my projects. They have all kinds of projects to choose from.

[Project Calendar](http://www.handsonportland.org/HOC__Volunteer_Opportunity_Calendar_Page) I got a note that the oregon food bank is in a bit of a bind, and need help sorting/repackaging perishables.  Its a wide range of stuff, I suspect some of the tasks would be perfect for you.  The building is pretty accessible, from the last time I was in there (other than, you know, the warehouse with forklifts) Volunteer as a greeter with OMSI! They're awesome.  Awesome! I've heard a bit about them. I'm a computer guy so yea I definitely will give them a look. Thank you. Hope you have a great day!  Awesome! Thanks.  Great. Thank you.   Free Geek is really great. They just redesigned their build room with an emphasis on accessibility too. I second checking them out.
