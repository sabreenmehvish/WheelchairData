Looking for suggestions of places to take senior photos, must be wheelchair accessible Hello everyone. I am in need of some expert SLC advice. I am taking my sisters senior pictures this week while she visiting. She is confined to a wheelchair which has made it much more challenging to come up with a good list of locations that are also accessible. Any and all recommendations would be very much appreciated, we've already gone to Red Butte Gardens but beyond that am open to any and all potential cool places.  The Downtown Library would be perfect. I had my bridals done there and they turned out great. You just have to get a sticker from the guys on the 5th floor if you want shots not just on Library Square but inside the library as well. Memory Grove, Sugar House Park, Salt Flats, Zion  Honestly, Liberty park at this time of year is great! All of the leaves fall around the trees, the Fall colors are coming out (currently yellow and green now) and if you go at the right time of day/evening to get the best "Fall" light then it all looks awesome. A lot of people shoot photos in the alley behind the green pig, I had a hard time getting the right angle on google maps:

Coincidentally there are people shooting photos around the corner in exchange plaza too:

 [Wheeler Farm](http://www.wheelerfarm.com) is gorgeous this time of year. The bird refuge in Layton.
