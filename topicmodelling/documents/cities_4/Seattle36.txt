The Greatest Hike, Ever I wanted to share with you all one of the best things I've seen...ever.

Just this morning, I went with a few friends to Mt. Pilchuck for a hike up the higher elevation trail which takes you all the way to the top with great views of the mountains, the Sound, everything. Far from an expert hiker, I thought the trail was a little difficult to maneuver with all the rocks once you got past the halfway point.

As we were about to start from the parking lot we saw a woman being pushed around in a wheelchair and I thought nothing of it. She was part of a group of about 12 people. Then we saw this large contraption which I can only describe as looking like a medical stretcher but with a chair in the middle. It was [litter-esq](https://www.google.com/search?q=litter+vehicle&safe=off&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=3IwiUo2gGYreigKLtYE4&ved=0CDkQsAQ&biw=1348&bih=751). I thought it was cool looking and we walked on.

About two hours later, after reaching the top, enjoying the amazing view - [shameless plug of my photo](http://gnatsandmockingbirds.tumblr.com/post/59912814083/admiring-the-view-from-the-top-of-mt-pilchuck) - and having some lunch, we started back down the part-trail/part-mountain climb trek back. A few minutes after we started our way down we saw the woman who had previously been in the wheelchair in the parking lot. She was grinning ear-to-ear, her eyes sparkling with wonderment as two young, sweaty, brave, amazing men carried her - she was almost to the top. Another person in my group asked, and they're all part of a church nearby (I want to say Seventh-day Adventist but I totally blanked - sorry!). The woman has MS and with the lost of muscle function, couldn't hold on to be strapped/hold on to someone's back and these people had thought of this solution. They had only done this once before about ten years ago. I don't know if it was for the same woman but everyone we came across in the group had not one complaint about and were very humble about the whole thing. 

It was honestly one of the most moving things I've ever seen in my life ("moving" is barely the word for it, but I'm at a lose for words). I have photos to remember the view but this is what will stick with me forever. I moved here two months ago from NYC and have experienced some of the kindest, most gentle and humble human beings of my life here (sans driver - I mean, come on). Awesome people like this are everywhere, but seeing this in action just made me love mankind and Washington even more. 

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Humans are awesome sometimes/we are lucky for what we have. [Picture of her being carried up](http://imgur.com/56MbHCH)

A friend hiking Mt. Pilchuck sent me this yesterday. Amazing story :)
 My boyfriend's brother is a quadriplegic and has a similar kind of rig that his friends have used to carry him all over the Black Hills near Olympia, and even on a multi-night backpacking trip in the Olympics. I am so impressed when I hear of their adventures. Your story is a nice reminder of the good in humanity, and a reminder that I have got to do that Pilchuck hike sometime!

EDIT: spelling My hubby, myself and 2 friends where there too! What an amazing story.  Great story! Thanks for sharing!  Hope for humanity?! Thanks for sharing the story! Damn. Awesome story. I hike ALL the time and this is truly an inspirational story. Pilchuck is a great hike, but for an MS sufferer, it would be mind-blowing. Hats off to all involved. That is true charity. The spot seen there is tough even if all you're carrying on your own two legs is yourself. 

This is a nice story. I've hiked Pilchuck many times.. good to hear of something like this happening up there.
