r/Philadelphia, Remember the guy who rides around in a wheelchair and sings "PHILLIES ---- are going to the WORLD SERIES!!!" with his boom box, around center city?  This aggression will not stand, man. SFJ is a highlight of Phillies tailgating for me.  >I know how some Southern people get angry at you, and then you find yourself out in the Everglades, all chopped up Stay classy Florida. MC Hooveround is awesome. 

\I have nothing of value to add here.  Outrage! I used to work in Center City and this guy is a city landmark as far as I'm concerned.

The city of Clearwater's transgressions will not go unanswered... honestly, no. Did something happen to him or something? Please take care of Scientology while you're down there, too. We need to petition the Phils to move their camp, clearly. That's a hyperlink up there...
