This guy just got stopped by the cops for riding an electric wheelchair on his stomach near SAC  ahhh. College. 

I remember in Lubbock on a windy day building a sail out of bedsheets and brooms, then put on my rollerblades and head on out.  Rofl. I recognize those cops. They come into my job all the time. They work for the mental health detail.  How do you know this is why he was stopped? [Oh really?](http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/i-m-sorry-i-thought-this-was-america-7.png) wat why? is that a crime? > They work for the mental health detail.

Ohhh, that makes sense in this case. It is probably very unsafe for him and those around him.  I imagine the chances of losing control of the chair and running it into traffic are increased when you are operating a chair in an awkward, unintended fashion...  Actually I KNOW it is unsafe; I used to work on power chairs for a living. Those joysticks are touchy as fuck. Because common sense Yep haha  Phew!   Glad the cops are on that hazard!  [deleted] The joysticks that power chairs are controlled with are very sensitive and janky... Flick your wrist the wrong way and the chair shoots off in an unintended direction.   Riding one down the street LAYING on the chair is not putting you in a position to be controlling the joystick accurately.

And then you careen off the sidewalk and into a bus.
