[Meetup] Eat, Drink, Be Happy, Lost and Found, Thurs 1 May 19:30 Lose (or loose; we’ll listen) your lamentations and find some friends at Lost and Found: come to our weekly central Oakland meetup to decompress, chat, and celebrate it almost being Friday.  There’s a reasonably consistent core group of around 6-12, but in the age of the Facebook "maybe", the only certain attendee is [this beardy fellow](http://i.imgur.com/e9ybViF.jpg) (my name is Nick).  7:30 is when the hordes migrate to the theaters, so it’s usually quiet enough to talk.  We usually wind down somewhen between 10 and 11.

**The venue:** This week is at [Lost and Found](http://www.yelp.com/biz/lost-and-found-oakland-6), the brand-new (opened on Easter) biergarten at [2040 Telegraph](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/278052125).  That’s just about two blocks from 19th Street Bart.  I went there on opening night to scope it out, and though they had their fair share of kinks, those should be mostly ironed out by now.  They are, from what I remember, relatively wheelchair-friendly.  They take credit cards, but I don’t remember if they have a full bar (70% sure they don’t), and have some food, though it’s a wee bit pricey and [their website lacks an online menu](http://www.lostandfound510.com/#oaklandlostandfoundkitchen).  Have no fear though, this [barely visible](http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xuATnebkp4Deuept0DjPdQ/l.jpg) breakdown on Yelp has you covered.  It’s got a very large open area in back (complete with ping pong to make fools of ourselves, if need be) and judging by the [fantastic evening weather](http://i.imgur.com/tlLXNKC.png), we will almost certainly be there.

**How do I find you?**  Normally it’s best to look by the bar, but this week look outside in back.  If we’re anywhere hidden or move around, I’ll try to put an update here.  For a better way to find us,

* Look for my [exceedingly pointy bicycle helmet](http://i.imgur.com/b6JIHqD.png) in a hopefully conspicuous place (probably a tabletop or bartop, but maybe under my arm).
* PM me and I can send you my google voice number and/or my IRC nick, either of which will push notifications to my phone

For those interested, there are more events posted to:

* [bayarea google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sfredditors) (has something almost every day)
* [bayarea facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/205326729493152/) (more weekend oriented?) [Beer menu side 1](http://i.imgur.com/exY3dk2.jpg)

 [deleted] Since there is an outdoor section would we be able to bring a dog? It's even legible after I've been at the cooking wine.  Hot damn! 8abv/16oz/$6 for an Red Death and 8/16/$5 for a Kiltlifter Scotch Ale.  My memory is off. Yeah, the only reason I wasn't already with you on the 99% is that I remember there being an alcove next to the front register that just screamed "liquor shelf" in my memory. If I remember right, they had a $5 16 oz of 9% though, which is pretty respectable. Disclaimer: I might have some of those numbers mixed up.  They allow dogs at the front section, outside only, it's a narrow strip with a ledge to place your drinks by the sidewalk. Maximum exposure to the sun since it faces west with no umbrellas. No one used it when I was there. No dogs allowed in the spacious back since you have to walk through the restaurant to get there. There was at least one dog there on opening day, but I would give them a call to bee sure. When I was there opening day, the one bartender seemed to be charging $7 across the board. He was so backed up on orders, we just let it slide.  Gotcha. Thanks. I was also there on opening day.  There were definitely some kinks.  When were you there? I was also there opening day and was charged menu prices, but my second round also came from a second (female) bartender so who knows. They were definitely backed up, though, even pretty soon after opening. BTW, that was the answer they gave on Facebook when someone asked. I was there once they opened until about 4. You? Oh I see. I'll check out that group. Thanks! I think I was there 6-8 or so.
