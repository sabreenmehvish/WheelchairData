Christmas in Milwaukee! I am coming to Milwaukee over Christmas, 21st to 26th, to visit and help care for a mentally ill/physically ill parent who lives near the Milwaukee/Wauwatosa border.  It's going to be quite bleak, so I'd love some recommendations on cheerful things to do to get her out of the house.  She has limited mobility and vision, so wheelchair friendly things are great.  I will be renting a van to get her around town.

I checked out the sidebar and have a great shortlist (Thanks!) but would like to do some holiday-ish stuff too.

Also, your tips on friendly, not-too-loud places to get some good craft beer on tap near the Tosa/Milwaukee Ave area are much appreciated! Depending on how poor her vision is, she might enjoy the holiday light displays at [Candy Cane Lane](http://candycanelanewi.com/). The Milwaukee Public Museum is decorating the Streets of Old Milwaukee for the holidays, that might be nice. The museum is wheelchair accessible as far as I know. There's a bunch of stuff going on downtown for the Holiday Lights Festival.

The Jingle Bus in particular is usually a good time! There is a plumbing store near 68th and Wells in Wauwatosa, who has 4 incredible Christmas window displays. Right near Balistreri's Pizza, who is also decked out with Christmas inside. Here's a Tosa Bar Guide that I've found helpful in the past.

There is a World of Beer location there, which, although corporate, has obviously a ton of beer choices, there's also the Malt Shoppe where you can shop for craft beer while drinking craft beer. Those are both REALLY corporatey places, but still good.  Brewski's, 76th & Bluemound has a decent craft beer selection and not too loud during weekdays and weekday nights. Small step in front to get in or walk around to patio for level entrance.
