Scooter/Wheelchair donations? Does anybody know a non-profit that takes donations of Motorized scooters and/or wheelchairs?  

Would love to help somebody out rather than junking it.  

Thanks! Maybe a local nursing home, assisted living facility, or church?  There used to be the center for independent living in wilkinsburg but it closed. You could check with a place like east end cooperative ministries Knights of columbus have a wheelchair program United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) takes donations like this! I believe their nearest affiliate is in Johnstown, PA: https://www.alucp.org/
