How be touristy with the grandparents. I'm going to bring my grandparents here to visit and they are really old and can't walk for too long. Since walking is my go-to form of transportation after getting myself downtown, I'm not sure what to do otherwise. How do I get 80ish-year-olds between all the cool important things (museums, libraries, historical monuments and significant government buildings)?

Metro: Seems like there's generally a 50% chance that you'll have to walk up or down a couple flights of stationary escalator.

Circulator bus: Avoids the Mall.

Taxis: Is this a viable option for getting between popular places?

Driving a car: lol

Any advice?

**EDIT: I obviously a word in the headline.** Pay for the hop on hop off bus. Worth it for one time tourists. Every museum has an ADA entrance and elevators. DC is very accessible to mobility-restricted people.

Metro has a van-service that you could look into. Not sure how it works, but it's for the mobile-impaired. I know your question is about the narrow area of transportation (and you didn't mention how much time you have spent with them before this trip or what their capacity is...so forgive me if you have this all figured out) but these considerations might impact your decisions: 

- How mobile are they? If they can't walk for long and you want them to be able to walk on their own in the museums, etc, you probably want as little public transpo as possible to minimize waiting/standing, escalators, walking unnecessarily, etc. Can you get one or both into wheelchairs at the museums?
- Do they need naps? If so, you will be doing shorter, more frequent trips (like, 2 places a day, one maybe closer to home) rather than one day-long destination visit like you might with 60 year olds. 
- How well do they get in and out of vehicles? Do you need something taller like an SUV? Can they get on busses in a timely manner?
- What do *they* want to see? 80 year olds (at least mine) need to be on-board with your agenda, otherwise they can make it difficult. 
- Do you need wheelchairs? Some places ask for a call/reserve ahead of when you need them. 

In all, you might want to consider things like the HopOn bus (as already noted) for the first day so they can see the whole Mall area, then getting Uber to drop you right where you want when you go to other places. The extra cost might pay for itself in lessening the anxiety and pain of getting around. 

Enjoy your time with your grandparents!
 So my folks were here a few weeks ago and my mom had recently have back surgery so walking was only an option for so much a day. The hotel they stayed at wasn't near a metro so they had to take a taxi to and from it, and on the second day they happened to get lucky and got an amazing guy named Gary who ran his own town car service. They used him throughout the week and not only was he reliable, extremely helpful, and just all around nice, he was extremely reasonably priced. If you pm me, I can send you his info. He or something like hm might be a good option when combined with the hop on hop off bus depending on the touring you want to do. Metro: Elevators

Taxis will go anywhere a car can, will just cost you.  Car2Go? Get to the Natural History Museum & then take a pedicab. They can get them much closer than nearly every other form of transportation. Maybe you can work a deal for a set period of time, instead of per trip. 

PS- If either were in the Navy, take them to the Navy museum, it is really well done.  Also, IMAX movies are a great way to get a quiet break, without going back home to rest/nap.  Segway tour? The regular buses go close to almost all of the touristy places, and are cheap. If you're going to be riding several buses, spring for Smartrips for them both and save some cash. Second the tour buses.  The doubledecker is maybe $30 and worthwhile.  Been in dc my whole life but the Your were still very entertaining for me too. Got to see a different perspective.  Thanks! They can walk good enough for inside-walking, where there are benches and air conditioning. They might be a little slow getting in and out of vehicles, but not to the extent that I would rule them out. I don't think they need naps, but they might want one. I don't know where they want to go, but I have a good idea of the sorts of things they like (museums, gardens, history). It sounds like a combination of the HopOn bus and Uber would be ideal. Thanks, I might PM you if they decide for sure that they want to come visit. Car2Go only has two seats, so unless grandma's riding in the back, someone's out of a ride. ;) Yup, pedi cabs can drop you off at museum doors, anywhere that bicycles can go. But they're also pricey, a mile trip cost me $20. If they like gardens, take them to the Hillwood Museum! It's not anywhere near downtown, so would be a can ride, but it's totally worth it. They've also got a cafe with tea time in the cafe, which would be a nice midday break. My mom's a gardening fiend and getting up there in age (decided a wheelchair escort at Dulles was necesaary) and loved it.
