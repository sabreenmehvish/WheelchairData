Anyone see this (DC area) ad for a cerebral palsy organization? Woke up at 2:30 AM last night and couldn't get back to sleep, so I started watching TV.  commercial comes on channel 50.something (1,2, or 3) for an organization fighting cerebral palsy (UCP?).  It shows a bunch of guys sitting around watching TV, one guy with palsy is in a wheelchair.   Everyone else is giving him the stinkeye.  The voiceover announcer talks about how he's ostracized because he's different and he isn't accepted; at the end they pan out and you see the guy with palsy in a Cowboys sweatshirt and everyone else in Redskins gear and the announcer says (in a very derisive voice) "he's a Cowboys fan".
    
    
Anyone else see this or know of a link?  I can't find any mention of it on the webs.
