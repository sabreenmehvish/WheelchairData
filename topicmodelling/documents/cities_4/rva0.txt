Most Wheelchair Accessible apartments/areas in RVA? Asking for a friend who is moving to town and is confined to a wheelchair (the nice electric kind, though).

I realize this is a broad question but we are just looking to help him find the most accessible apartment with a decent amount of space/access. Also, it helps for him to be able to roll out onto the street and access restaurants and stores so the overall area comes into play too.

He will be working in willow lawn, but has an assistant who will drive him to work too so he doesnâ€™t necessarily need to be *in* willow lawn.


Thanks for any help! Maple Springs had decent wheelchair accessible apartments when I was there (I use a manual chair) but I bought a house and left September 2017 so I'm not sure what it's like now.  There are nice apartments in the Willow Lawn area that are very nice and fairly new. Stay away from the Fan or the Bottom. The sidewalks are terrible.  Anything with over 20-ish units is required to have at least one ADA apartment, so, if your friend sticks to the larger complexes, they are more likely to find success. I've never been inside so I'm not sure, but maybe the Ironhouse building on Broad? I'm pretty sure it has an elevator (from online listing pics), and there's lots of stuff around.  

   That and many larger complexes will work with you in making an apartment accommodate your needs.
