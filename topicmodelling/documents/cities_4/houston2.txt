Saw this woman drive up and give this man a new wheelchair. I don't know who she is, but she seems like a good person.  Where was this at OP? I've been to a couple of small events here in Houston recently in support of Free Wheelchair Mission, yall should check them out, great organization. We did this with my father's wheelchair when he passed away last year after a super-short fight with cancer.  It was brand new and we didn't know what else to do with it. A good reminder that not all people are garbage.  r/HumansBeingBros Sorry for to bad quality, I had to zoom in a lot to get this picture.  What was wrong with the old one? I actually talked to this guy today! He said it was the VA. Very sweet fellow he deserves it False, sheâ€™s doing it for Likes I keep thinking of the Seinfeld episode with the defective wheelchair. It was at the Taco Bell on Holcombe and Greenbriar. Texas Medical Center area.  Good man [deleted] Holy crap I was there yesterday. Wild.  TMC? Ah... Mecca of the homeless I waited 40 minutes there for my order once. Not sure if I was more annoyed by that or that I let myself wait 40 minutes for taco Bell  They're great, sometimes they slip up and don't include items in the bag which is infuriating, but a phone call and they're always on top of fixing the issues. I miss their drive thru guy! He was always sooo happy, regardless of what time I went there. [deleted] [deleted] This man Fire Sauce's Gotta be the same guy! He had a contagious good mood, could put a smile on the face of even the grumpiest of medical workers. "please pull forwarrrrd~"
