Meeting places around town? Hi all!

I have a Meetup group that I'm looking to start and would like to find a good place for it! I am a St. Louis native but I don't know of a lot of places that can accommodate a good amount of people. So I figured I would ask the hive mind here!

Here's the main issue: A lot of us are in wheelchairs and most cafes/restaurants/libraries/other meeting places simply can't accommodate more than a couple of wheelchairs easily. This also rules out anywhere that isn't well-paved if it's outside.

Can anyone pretty please help? What about something like the paved area in Tower Grove park that the farmers market is on? It's mostly unused during the week and has paved walkways leading to it.  Rooster on Grand is ramped and has flexible seating that would work well for multiple wheelchairs. Free parking in back, as well.
 In Kirkwood, outside in front of Crushed Red and Kahldis.  Several of the restaurants in The Loop are wheelchair accessible. Like front door accessible.  I will look into that, thank you! Maybe also the north parking lot of the science center. It's free to park there and there are things outside to do. If there's kids they'll like it. All close to the road and paved.
