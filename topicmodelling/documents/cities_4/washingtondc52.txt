Time to arrive national mall for fireworks What time should I arrive at the national mall for the fireworks?  I don't want to see anything else during the day.  I am just looking for a good view of the fireworks.  I don't really want to camp out all day to get a perfect view. I will be with someone in a wheelchair. 8:45
 You still have an hour or two to get a good spot. https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3c0pnv/fireworks_show_tomorrow/ Usually if you go closer to the Washington monument you don't have to show up incredibly early to get a spot. 

We went one year at ~8:30 and sat on the curb on 15th St. If you do that though you may have black stuff(burnt fireworks) fall on your shirt though.
