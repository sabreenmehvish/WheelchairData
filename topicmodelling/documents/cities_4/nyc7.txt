First American Woman To Win NYC Marathon in 4 Decades. Congratulations Shalane Flanagan!  The emotion on her face when she was on the podium was really special. Amazing to watch.  I loved how the commentators had a hard time believing she would win even though she was in the leading pack of 3 for the whole race, kept saying “and then there’s also Flanagan ...”. Then around mile 22 ... “it would be very special for her, the crowning achievement of her career.” NY marathon is a uniquely soulful experience. Its as if everybody is in harmony,  specifically, the supporters &  kids who hold out their hands to five and cheer on the charities etc.  An-mhaith Shalane  USA #1 The Irish music program on WFUV radio just gave her a shout out.  Congrats to her. Proud to be an American and proud to have run with* her today!

*nowhere even CLOSE to Headphone warning on the embedded video. Ad plays at perfect loudness, but the actual video the gains are cranked up. Who is editing this stuff?  The title is a little misleading. She won the women's race over a Kenyan.  [deleted] [removed] [deleted] Ohhh yeah. I got all teary eyed seeing her finish Trying to avoid the commentator's curse. Man, I gotta run this some day. It's really fun, even just as a spectator! An-mhaith Shalane? Finishing any marathon is emotional. But watching her finish....whooo. Can you guys imagine the high?! Me trying to drive to the west side of Williamsburg, and then walk back to the train was definitely *not* in harmony. How is "First American Woman To Win NYC Marathon in 4 Decades" misleading?

What does your non sequitur about the runner-up being a Kenyan have to do with anything?  The title doesn't say anything about the other contestants. Wtf man I bet you look like a fat fuckin slob ? If you live in/near the city then the New York Road Runners 9+1 program is a great way to gain entry.

It's a financial commitment (fee to register with NYRR and entry fees each race, albeit discounted) but it's good to get race day experience under your belt. Do it. I ran it for a NY who was lost in Afghanistan 2005.It was a personal thing. It was uniquely New York experience, and extremely soulful. The kids..just everybody, it felt like 1000's of people were there in harmony. Extremely humbling, never felt anything like it anywhere.  

tl;dr yes, you can do it!  Same here, but it seems almost unattainable. I'm going to try for 2019 or 2020, though.  Well done/ bravo in Gaelic.  [deleted] I mean, I thought at first it meant she won the whole race until I read the article.  So, at least one person was confused.  Yes, I am a simpleton. But I was still confused.  I thought it was misleading because when I think of races (and I run a lot of them), I usually think of there only being 1 overall winner, and then the splits between gender and age group after.

The title mentions "American Woman" which is why I brought up  Mary Keitany, who is from Kenya and has won the race for 3 straight years. The title could make it sound like she was first overall if you don't know that they split the men and women. If she beat all the men too that'd be really impressive.  It's misleading because she didn't win the marathon. Some dude named Geoffrey Kamworor did. No idea where the Kenyan thing came from. Although this is the first time since 2010 that the the winner of both the mend and women's division wasn't from Kenya or Ethiopia. Turns out they're quite good at this. So that's why it's a big deal.  ignore the troll  This is such a great way of describing the environment during the race. As someone who has both run and spectated the race, it is something so uniquely beautiful and cathartic. An incredible experience. think it's supposed to be "seo am-mhaith," though my irish is rusty. Upvote for calling it Irish and not Gaelic Ah I see. I thought it might be Arabic 

Why the hell was I downvoted? She did win the whole race. How are you still confused about this.

There are *four separate races* that occur during the NYC Marathon. They use the same course but start (and finish) at different times. These four races are: Men's foot race, women's foot race, men's wheelchair race, and women's wheelchair race. Each race has a winner, making for four winners in total. If there was an overall winner (though there isn't), it would go to the winner of the men's wheelchair race, who finished with the fastest time. Well then, you're not thinking about races correctly, because the men are not competing against the women. Does Wimbledon similarly confuse you, because instead of having an "overall" winner, there is a male and female winner? It's the same for pretty much any sport I can think of. Actually, if you insist on being stupid about it, you should know that Marcel Hug is the one who actually "won" the "overall" marathon, with a time of 1:37:21.

Or, you could not be stupid about it and accept the fact that there are four different races, with different starting and ending times, that use the same course on the same day. That wouldn't really make sense though, as she's not Arab ... I'm not *still* confused.  I *was* confused.  And then I read the article.  And then I was *not* confused.  You're missing two smaller races as well.  Men's handcycle and women's handcycle.  We just don't get a purse.  Same course, same challenges.   No, because Serena never plays against Federer so we don't really know who's better.

I beat a lot of my male friends in races that we run together. Can I not say that I beat them because we are not competing against each other? Maybe I just have higher standards for myself as a female runner? > It's the same for pretty much any sport I can think of.

Auto Racing (Danica Patrick) doesnt have separate groupings by gender.  Actually, no.  Ludovic Narce won the Men's Handcycle with a time of something like 1:28.

But I enjoyed your nuanced point nonetheless. the commenter could have been. anyone know how to pronounce that btw? How was I supposed to know that without being told? TIL that handcycle and wheelchair are different competitions.  I was sort of aware that they used different devices but I didn't realize that they were ranked separately (although that makes sense).

Are you a handcycle competitor?  If so, that's awesome.  I'm just a normal amateur non-competitive cyclist, and looking at that handcycle speed for the marathon they'd be giving me a run for the money using their *arms* versus my *legs*! I don't see how amateur races are relevant.  Amateurs of any gender can beat amateurs of any other gender in any sport, as there is a wide range of skill and natural ability across amateur contestants.

However, we're talking about the *elites* here.  There are [hundreds](http://www.marathonguide.com/history/records/alltimelist.cfm?Gen=M&Sort=Time), if not thousands, of men who are faster than the fastest woman.  It is not a competition.  It's not even close.  If you insist on talking about "overall" winners then you will only be talking about men, which is not fair to women (who make up the majority of the runners in the world).  They are separate competitions.

As for Serena vs Federer, we know who'd win.  It'd be the same gender emerging victorious as in every other sport.  The fastest recorded male serve is over [*50 kph* faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_recorded_tennis_serves) than the fastest recorded female serve.  It wouldn't even be close.  Testosterone is an insurmountable advantage when it comes to athletic performance, with the possible exception of extreme endurance sports, though the field of competitors there isn't large enough to draw definitive conclusions. Fair enough.  Though the cars are doing most of the work there ...

Also, there's so few female race car drivers at the professional level that there *can't* be a separate competition for woman.  MMA had a similar problem until recently, but at least with racing the women can join the competition with the men whereas in MMA it'd be a bloodbath that no one would want to watch. Hrm, I didn't realize that handcycle and wheelchair were separate.  So that extends my point ... there's actually *six* different races going on.  Thanks for the pointer. Because her name is obviously Irish? C'mon, she's named Flanagan. You can look at the finishers and find me on that list.  Before the fold... but way too low to consider myself a *competitor* though. **Fastest recorded tennis serves**

This article lists the fastest recorded tennis serves in the men's and women's games. This list may not be historically complete. For instance, there are reports that Bill Tilden had a serve that was clocked at 163.3 mph but there is nothing to verify that.

Although the Association of Tennis Professionals does not formally recognise service speed records made in Challenger events due to the variance in radar guns, the serve of 263.4 km/h (163.7 mph) recorded by Australian Sam Groth at an ATP Challenger event in Busan, South Korea in May 2012 was measured using approved equipment, and other data gathered appeared within a normal range.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 Fair enough. I will say though that the lines blur a bit when it comes to things like marathons (and other races), where you see professionals, amateurs, women, and men, all running on the same course together. I'm sure I wasn't the ONLY one confused by the title.

 What i always found kinda silly is they have men and women separate in Chess.  The poster I replied to's nick is "Mr_Illuminaughty" sorry I didn't make the connection  Then shouldn't it by McFlanagan? /s There is a separate women's competition but there isn't a men's competition -- the two types of competition are open (any gender) and women's.  The separate women's competition exists because Chess is such a male-dominated game that it becomes self-perpetuating in keeping women out if there isn't some kind of competition where women can actually feel at home. Nah man, that'd make it O'Flanagan.  McFlanagan is a Scotswoman.
