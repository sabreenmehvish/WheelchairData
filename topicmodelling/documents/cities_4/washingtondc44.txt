DCA and elderly passenger Hi all,

My grandfather is flying from DCA via delta in a few weeks and I'm quite nervous about it... He is elderly, but pretty mobile, just needs a cane or walker. Regardless, we have made a reservation on his ticket so he can have someone wheel him through security to gate. He has not flown in well over 40 years and cannot read well, so we didn't want him trying to find his own way. When I called delta to ask where he'll check in for wheelchair assist, they said a  counter (didn't seem like ticket counter), but a car company told me its curbside (he can't drive (well he can, but not in dc)). Does anyway know where in DCA he needs to go?

We don't have any family in DC so he's on his own. Is it easy to find the assistance counter? Our plan is to either hire a care taker for the day to pick him up via uber and help him find where he is going. Any other suggestions? Is it super easy to find help there if an uber just drops him off in the delta area and an escort is unnecessary? He is the absolute sweetest man, and I'm so afraid someone will take advantage of him! I just want to make sure this is easy for him as he's VERY nervous about flying as well. 

I know that's an outpouring of some random thoughts, but if anyone familiar with the area/airport can give me guidance, I'd appreciate it. Our airport in town is nothing like DCA! I am 90 percent sure if he goes to delta curbside checkin a sky cap ca help him get sorted.  is he a veteran? active uso office is there and I've seen them really take care of vets Ok, thank you. That's much less daunting then having to go inside! He is a vet, so I will look into that. Thank you! Is he coming on an honor flight to see the memorials?  He's not, he's actually flying out to see family! It should be a nice trip for him!
