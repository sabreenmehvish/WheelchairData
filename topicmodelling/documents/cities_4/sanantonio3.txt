Where to Report ADA Discrimination? My SO is a disabled vet that requires the use of a service dog. Today, we decided to try out a new restaurant and the host refused to seat us. To whom can we report this illegal discrimination? Thanks!! [If its a service dog, the restaurant cannot refuse service. If a comfort animal yes the restaurant can refuse.](https://www.ada.gov/archive/qasrvc.htm)If it was a service dog can you please name the restaurant if not please disregard the owner was in the right.  Its a shitty scummy thing to refuse a person with a service dog.  Start by emailing HR! So rude and considering we’re in  Texas.  When I was growing up, those signs that said a place reserved the right to refuse service to anybody really meant something. ~~As unfortunate as that is, and I’m sorry to hear that happened to you and your SO, but I’m pretty sure the restaurant has the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. Federal law only prohibits discrimination of race, color, national origin or citizenship. ~~

Edit: I still think you should leave a review via Facebook, yelp, and google.  Let others know what happened to you and bring awareness to the issue. Court of public opinion is more powerful than the legal system.  The dog is a service dog and was properly vested as such. And the restaurant was Berni Vietnamese Restaurant on Wurzbach. That link is outdated. [here](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html) is the updated version. And here is [How to File an ADA Complaint with DOJ](https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm) Like the HR at the restaurant? Like a little mom and pop restaurant? I'm pretty sure the host was also the owner :-/ Totally surprised this would happen in "military city USA", but I know it's not reflective of SA. Most restaurants are aware of ADA regs, this is the first time we've had an issue!  Yeah, too bad they dont make those "Whites Only" signs anymore /s Actually, discriminating against someone with a service dog is a federal offense and in violation of the ADA [(Americans with Disabilities Act)](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html). It's just like telling someone that uses a wheelchair that they're not welcome to dine-in. Service animals are not pets. They're trained to perform specific tasks that assist persons with disabilities. Just like a wheelchair helps a person who can't walk become mobile.  I just tried that restaurant the other night. Food was pretty bad, as was the service, so at least you have that going for you. [Also](https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm) Sorry y'all experienced that.  He probably thought you were bringing outside food. ^sorry What would happen today if somebody put up a "Whites Only" sign at a place and the government didn't do anything about it? I was indeed mistaken. It is absolutely against the law. You are absolutely correct and I apologize. [Texas statutes ](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.437.htm#437.023) indeed prohibits food establishments from denying service to service animals.  I think they might've been worried that OP's dog might smell the other dogs in the back... I'll see my self out. Thanks :) I'd like to think society has progressed enough by this point for it to cause some sort of uproar. Then again, we live amongst people who still think it's ok to discriminate against the disabled  No worries!! It's actually a pretty common misconception. No. Let me tell you what would happen. If a business did that today in San Antonio, Tx they would not be in business very long. They would lose customers. They would lose suppliers. They would lose employees. There is no need to have a law against refusing to serve people on the basis of race. Uproar (noun) - a public expression of protest or outrage
