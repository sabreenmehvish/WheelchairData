Looking to donate a dog wheelchair Anyone know of a good shelter that would need one? Could even be a person you know with an ailing dog. Just want to make sure it goes to a pet in need and not flipped for profit on Craigslist  Contact https://www.hopeforpaws.org they recently rescued a dog that had problems with his hind legs This shelter in Sherman Oaks sometimes has rescued dogs with missing/injured legs due to torture.

https://animalhopeandwellness.org/dogs Please ask A Purposeful Rescue. They do great work and are always saving “medically complex” dogs from city shelters. That's nice of you. Maybe you can google some local rescues that maybe specialize in helping dogs with health issues, and give them a call.  Try calling your local vet's office.  They may know someone who specifically works with disabled pups
