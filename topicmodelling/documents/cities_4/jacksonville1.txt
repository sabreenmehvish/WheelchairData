Adventures for wheelchair bound My father in law is ill and wheelchair bound. He's from El Paso and moved here for cancer treatments. I'm trying to make the best out of his time here and could use some ideas. He's especially interested in fishing. We're willing to travel as long as it's wheelchair accessible.  Check out Dutton Island Preserve. I know there are a couple piers there that people fish off of and I think at least one of them is accessible.  Castaway island preserve has a paved sidewalk trail. I think all the piers are wheelchair friendly. St aug pier. Jax beach puts out a big carpet by Joes Crab shack and so does neptune to get to the beach as well if he wants to try saltwater shore fishing.

Hell, any redditors want to take this guy (and me and my dad?!?) pier fishing and show us the ropes?  My friend is in a wheelchair and just went to Amelia Island to fish and used Semper Fi Charters https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/508449475890004/semper-fi-charters/
