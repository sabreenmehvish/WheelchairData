Wheelchair Rental Heading to Vegas this weekend and meeting up with parents. What are the chances anyone knows about renting a wheelchair for the week while we're there. I've used Las Vegas Wheelchairs - http://www.lasvegaswheelchairs.com/ - when my parents are in town. The location isn't the greatest, but they're friendly and the price was right. when I ruptured my Achilles years back, I was bored and went to vegas a lot.  every hotel that I went to, (mgm, venetian, wynn, cosmo, caesars, Bellagio, aria) always gave me one for free when I checked in.  I cant speak for the cheaper hotels, but I never had a problem getting one and I never paid a penny for it.    That's good info,  I'll have to check that out.  Thanks
