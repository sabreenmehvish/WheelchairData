Best tourist things to do for someone who can’t walk long distances? My grandmother is coming in to visit next month! We are planning the weekend with her but are finding most of the things we usually do require a lot of walking! Anything ideas??? Phoenix Symphony?

The botanical garden has wheelchairs for rent just inside the main entrance I would say drive up to Williams Az and hit up Bearizona. You can drive around the park a few times and never get out if you don’t want to. Then maybe drive back through Sedona. Not sure if it’s too snowy yet, but Pink Jeep tours are cool.  My mom has pulmonary issues and so can't walk long distances.  We went to the Phoenix Zoo today.  They have wheelchairs and electric scooters to rent, so she only had to make it from the parking lot to the zoo entrance, and then she was good.  Recommended. Most attractions have both motorized scooters and wheelchairs available for rent. My MIL used a scooter at the Botanical Gardens the last time she went there and it made her day there pretty enjoyable.  You might find that it is cheaper to rent one from a medical supply place for the period that she will be in town unless you will only use it for one or two places.   Drive up to the Dobbins lookout at South Mountain. Grand canyon Good to know! I didn’t realize the botanical garden had wheelchairs! We may choose to go there, thank you!  you got downvoted for some reason but you can totally visit the Grand Canyon with limited mobility. Most of the viewpoints are right off the parking area for them and 20-30 steps away at most.
