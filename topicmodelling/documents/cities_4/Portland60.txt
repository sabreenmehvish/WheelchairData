/r/portland Thanksgiving VI: Annual Location Thread! Hey all!
 
/u/coolhandmarie, myself, and several hundred folks from /r/Portland (and elsewhere) get together every year and do Thanksgiving.  It began as something for those of us who don't have / can't get to / don't want to see families, and has become something that folks also bring families to (or just come drink with us after family events).

In prior years, we have used homes, warehouses, restaurants, and other spaces.  Given 20-100 people are together at any time, we're doing our annual call for locations.  **Do you have a space, or an idea for one, to host this year on Thanksgiving?**

A large-ish home, a workshop, an event space, restaurant, really anywhere that has a kitchen and can accommodate wheelchairs **^^(1)** - if you are awesomely willing to even *potentially* be a host (we'll chat with you offline) or have a location that you would be willing to offer up for a nominal fee (or free!), let us know in the comments below (or PM me to be anonymous). **^^(2)**

Thanks all - look forward to seeing faces old and new again this year!  /u/coolhandmarie - am I forgetting anything?

Cheers,
/u/Purple_Antwerp and /u/coolhandmarie

**(1)** - Not necessarily ADA compliant, but wheelchair accessible entryway and a bathroom that can be navigated is what we gun for; I built a ramp the first year up my stairs, for example.

**(2)** - Chairs are easily acquired, tables as well if needed. Space for 50-100 folks, and an oven, microwave, and ideally two+ bathrooms is all that is needed.  Inner(ish) PDX is ideal, and must be public transport accessible so everyone can come!  Usually runs from early afternoon to roughly 8pm.
 Just wanted to say that you guys do a great job organizing this every year.  We might be miserable, homeless-averse, shitposting assholes here, but events like this make me proud to be here.  

I'll be stuck going to family events this year, but I'd gladly donate some $ for turkey or booze.  Just lemme' know where to send it. Hey! I have an idea! My Masonic lodge!

Milwaukie Masonic Temple - we can seat 125 I think. We have all the tables and chairs and a kitchen with 2 ovens and a dishwasher - we also have a stage and two restrooms downstairs along with a 12 foot movie screen and projector. We're also about a 5-minute walk from the Milwaukie MAX station and there a ton of busses nearby. There's also a large parking lot across the street. We're really reasonable when it comes to rates. I help with that and the money helps us keep the building and do the maintenance. 

We're $400 a pop but I think I can let them use my member rate. Who's ever in the know, PM me.

 I wonder if Chinese Village in montavilla could fit that? The restaurant is closed for now, and they do have banquet space.

Edit: They do have a huge parking lot, and might consider... If you call, ask for Doug. I think the bar will be open. They might just consider letting the restaurant and banquet be used for a private event. I have been in contact with a few event spaces, but nowhere that seems to fit the bill yet. I do not mind fronting the cost/deposit for the right place like we did last year. Just need some leads on where else to call. Anyone who thinks their workplace, business, or house *might* be just right for a giant friendly potluck, please contact me. Did I ever mention my father was a tug boat engineer? He helped rescue people who otherwise might have been lost at sea. Anyways, I ended up involved with the Captain of the Subaru Maru, completely unrelated to my father's duties.  Anyways, that ship brought 3000 cars in monthly. It was huge, and I was given a grand tour, although I chose to spend most of my time in the captain's quarters. What a grand event could have happened there. I had a great time, don't get me wrong, just thinking outside of my own mental blocks. 

Even with all the "density", there has to be someplace to ..... Sadly I do not have a place to contribute but myself and my SO are glad to help pay for any venue that may cost a bit like last year. We are also getting a turkey tonight to bring to this event once a location is decided. We are very excited, last year was super fun! I'm interested in helping out with this. I would offer my home (it's ADA accessible and on a max line) but I don't think it is big enough. I'll be on the lookout for venues but in the meantime let me know how else I can help. Some sort of banquet was held tonight at Chinese Village, and I was privileged to look inside. Damn, very good food, and a lot bigger than I imagined. Being a polite, diminutive redheaded woman gets me into places I Never imagined. I am more than happy to pitch in with cash if someone has a rental type location in mind! Please PM me, I would love to help in any way possible.  You are doing god's work Not sure what it would cost, but Stadium Freddy's has the 20th Place Workshop and additional space on the top floor. Both are available for rent last I checked. hey /u/coolhandmarie, here are a bunch of venues we could look into, I assume you and /u/Purple_Antwerp already checked out sites like this but figured it was worth posting: https://www.eventective.com/portland-or/party-reunions.html I see by the marquee, the Canton Grill on division is also closed Now is not too soon to put and keep this thread on top. It may take some doing to find the right place and connect with the property owner.

I'm not fixated with the the Chinese Village venue. It seems ideal due to all food is gone, but equipment is still there. They are near to stark/Belmont bus, Burnside bus, 82nd and Max. Problem is they have no way to lock down the bar liquor, so at least 1 on their staff has to be there.

I checked Portland maps, and the restaurant owners live a couple of blocks away. Maybe snail mail them? If another venue is found, you might need Portland maps to contact the owners of that property. There used to be an unused church on 78th about a block south of glisan. I believe Ethiopians or Eritreans took it over. Not sure if they'd be willing to lend it out. From what I know, which admittedly isn't much, they abstain from alcohol. An unused church might be cool tho. Think Alice's Restaurant. Wait, we aren't protesting colonialism? Reaction seems a bit muted this year... I'll chalk it up to my lackluster post. Thanks for the kind words! Hey!  Hope to have you there either way.  Thanks again!

If you lads and ladies end up at the Milwaukie Masonic Temple, Chan's Steak House has an awesome bar that's connected to them (I would even consider calling them about hosting the Thanksgiving dinner). Their bartenders are really cool and they have daily karaoke. It would be an awesome spot if people want to gather there after the dinner. They're pretty accommodating. Plus they serve delicious food and have cheap good drinks! [deleted] Milwaukee? How many busses to there? Hey!  Hope to have you there!

Hey!  Hope to have you there!  Thanks for all the responses again.  We found a place (prior host, our hero!) after a search - including most (maybe all) of the places you suggested.  Hard luck this year, but a last minute success!

Hey! Sorry to butt back in, but can you PM me your phone number? I mean in a "ask you for a few thoughts about Thanksgiving" way, not in a "hey I just heard you are a small redhead" way. Haha. Hey!  Hope to have you there!

[deleted] We bought a 14lb turkey for this year's event, so it better still be on! Maybe we can make another post to generate more hype or something? I know I'm excited That’s where we go! 

Sadly, last night I learned we got swooped and somebody rented it on Friday. I’m contacting a few other places to see if they have space.  That is my very favorite karaoke bar. Chan's is the best.  I'll PM you.  According Google, the 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 75, and the 125.  Nope! Thanks for the ping. I will call first thing in the morning!  Did anyone get a venue figured out yet?
EDIT: It's a 14lb organic bird from New Seasons... hope we can find somewhere to share it with everyone! [removed] Ty, and I have more than one number. I think they're kinda hawt. Hey!  Hope to have you there!  Finally got a location, so be prepared!

Also the 70. I was just there. They are closed t-day, and their final day open is 12/10. If I bartended there, I'd be begging for this. I know redditors would also be buying drinks in the bar and watching the games. Place is closing for economic development. *sigh*. If I hear of another place, I'll post here. I removed your post.  You should probably PM your number directly to /u/coolhandmarie.  ;)   You are presumptive.
Why should I give a care if someone has my number? I am number 1. As it should be and always be. Oh. And you can remove your childish expiations. Eh I know (or assume) its your number, but it is mentioned in the our rules:

> ...Posting of personal Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn profiles as well as phone number, addresses, or similar information of non-celebrities is not allowed.

Mostly because we don't want to have to call random phone numbers to check and see if they're legit. I got my mother's business number shortly after she died. It was also my # as a child. My father called me "keed". And I still get calls at that number for people looking to sell her things. I tell them good luck finding her body, as my sister hid her ashes, and bitches at me I should have paid half of the burial costs, without knowing where she is interred. I told her she has buried enough husbands, she should have known what what those costs would be. I don't answer random calls. Funny that.
