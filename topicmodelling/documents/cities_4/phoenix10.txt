Any good hiking spots with paved trails? I'm gonna be moving to the area in January and I have two dogs, but one is in a wheelchair. I'm looking for spots with nice scenery but also paved paths so we can take her out with us to enjoy some nature.
Any good recommendations? Thanks! "A" mountain is paved halfway up (to a viewing spot). Dreamy Draw has a paved bicycle pathway that goes for quite a bit. I'm pretty sure South Mountain has a paved trail somewhere? I'd also recommend Marcus Landslide in the McDowells... it isn't paved but it's a wide trail and isn't very bumpy and should be okay for a doggy wheelchair. I'd probably walk it first to make sure. It's an easy hike, too.  Paved trails are hard to come by but there are a lot of well maintained dirt trails that your wheelchair should be able to handle. Just look for hikes without a lot of elevation gain  Papago Park  North Mountain is paved to the summit.  Thanks!! I'll check these out :) Thanks!!
