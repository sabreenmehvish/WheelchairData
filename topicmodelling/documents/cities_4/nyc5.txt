MTA plans decade of hell to finally fix subways  Ten years later, 90 billion and "we need another ten years" I don't normally shame articles for misspellings or bad grammar, but my lord what is happening here?? This is just a way to get everyone used to the MTA being shitty and not performing up to standards of general large cities.  (London, Hong Kong, Paris , Toyko, etc...) London's subway is older than us but it doesn't have stalatite hanging down in plain sight. is it not way cheaper to enhance service to drive around the disabled? We seriously need to spend millions (billions?) to make sure one of the few people in the city in a wheelchair that might happen to use ___ subway station can do so?  

 You can bet right now that's how its going to go or worse. Things will fall apart even more before they are even done with this. 

Best solution would have been to ease traffic load on the subway by making new ways to get to manhattan. Designate a few hubs in three boroughs qnc, bk, bx. Find some above ground transportation setup could be train or something else. Hubs connect to manhattan express. From the hubs in manhattan subway can take over for specific trips. 

 Aurora Borealis. No my guy it's not. Besides it's not just disabled people who use them. It's mothers and elderly people too. Get your head out of the sand and join the rest of the developed world. Yes, we do need to enhance the existing infrastructure because wheelchair users are people, too.
