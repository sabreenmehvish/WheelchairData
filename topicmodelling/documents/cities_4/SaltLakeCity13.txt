Looking for a resource Hello, SLC Reddit! 

Iâ€™m not a Salt Lake native and unfamiliar with the types or assistance offered here. I work at a facility providing affordable childcare for families in need in Taylorsville. We have a parent in a wheelchair who lives close to our facility but far enough that the snow makes it challenging for him to drop off and pick up his child. Unfortunately our policy is to not give students a ride home in personal vehicles. I was hoping that this post could maybe catch the eye of someone who has a contact or can point me in the right direction. 

Edit: grammar is hard  If you call 211 they should have resources to point you to. Wonderful! Thank you so much!
