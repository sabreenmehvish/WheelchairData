Portland, the city of hypocrisy ... another rant with another example of the reality of this city **EDIT:** Thanks, guys. I feel better today. And I do know we can all come together and agree that Portland knows its shit with coffee. But ... as for you tea drinkers ... only republicans drink tea, because coffee comes out brown. **Mic drop**

My pet peeve is hypocrisy. It’s human nature, but it’s still annoying to everyone. 

I’m already pissed off from a shitty flight.

And my first display back home, while coming down to baggage claim, is another beautiful insight into the reality of this city’s hypocrisy.

Portlanders talk a big game, but when some elderly homeless man in his electric wheelchair is by the bathroom, asking for help ... every Portlander suddenly goes deaf and blind, unable to see him waving, or hear him mumbling for help. 

I laugh inside when I see everyone ignore each other at the grocery store, but then go out if their way to say hi to a minority. It’s harmless and makes me laugh. 

I am a regular dude that does the same thing I’ve seen done in Idaho, where I grew up, by men who used racial slurs without a second thought. When seeing someone in trouble, no matter the skin color, they still acted and helped. 

So ... Wonderful Portlanders are twittering at their gov reps to be more progressive and caring ... and then reality hits them with an elderly crippled homeless black man that is covered in his piss ... the ultimate gift for a self-righteous Portlander to help. 

I was able to see such beautiful display of brotherly love for 20 seconds as I walked up to him. 

And yes, I got piss on my hands. And yes, I got his wheelchair to a corner where we plugged in his wheelchair. 

And yes, you better believe I saw all those shitty Portlander faces staring at me, perplexed, like my actions didn’t make any sense.

And I’m just an average joe. I’m seriously another semi-uncaring city Ahole. I ignore crack heads like everyone else. I don’t really care about strangers. But, the complete disregard for a guy whose life is so shitty and unlucky ... it’s dark seeing that shit, and seeing everyone look the other way. 

Fuck this city. Fuck Oregon. And fuck Idaho, too. It’s no heaven. They’re no better. But, at least they don’t lie and posture like our wonderful city. If you're at the airport, there's a good chance a large percentage of the people around you are not Portlanders. This rant is incoherent. I love when out-of-state people come here and then are instantly experts on how Portland is supposed to be. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to post this on your Live Journal? [deleted] We Portlanders used to go out of our way to help the homeless, then we all got hepatitis.

Also...

>I ignore crack heads like everyone else. I don’t really care about strangers.

Okay! well, I'm sure they could book another flight back to wonderful idaho for ya :) there are prolly plenty of piss covered folk there you could help, I'm sure it would salve your rage......

most people here: aren't above helping, but when every street corner has someone that needs help, it's just not possible, as most, I ignore most folks, if I see something that has to be done, I will do it, empathy is not solely an "every time something happens" piece of peoples lives, individuals just can't help everyone they see, the way they can help is by lobbying the legislature and or the city to do something with the tax dollars we pay....it's pretty simple, your whole note is hypocritical in that regard to, if we lobby so hard to help these folks with OUR own money, is not that a similar piece? how can we both ask our city to spend our money on improvements yet not care at all??? this is spoken like someone who pays about $50 a year in taxes.

Have some gawd damn coffee kid. Hey, if you manage to fuck off somewhere full of Utopian brotherly love, where people don't act like..people, let us all know where the next cool place is, alright?  Your motivations are suspect. You get a gold star sticker and a trip back to Idaho....grats? > Portlanders talk a big game, but when some elderly homeless man in his electric wheelchair is by the bathroom, asking for help ... every Portlander suddenly goes deaf and blind, unable to see him waving, or hear him mumbling for help.

There's a black man about 40 years old downtown. He rides around in a wheel chair and will often stop in the middle of a street, or just before the ramp of a sidewalk, and sit there. He just sits there. And sits there. And sits there. Sometimes he slips his shoe off if no one is helping. 

Someone will come along and ask him if he needs help, or move him out of the street. Then he explains how he's going just a few blocks down, and how he needs help getting there. It's always *just only* a few blocks he needs to go. People oblige. Once they arrive in front of the building or at the corner, he asks for just a few dollars, because he's hungry. 

I've seen this man on the street for years. He's a junkie. I've seen him buying drugs, seen him passed out. I've seen him get out of his wheel chair and run from the cops. It's a miracle. He was living in some section 8 housing downtown, not sure where he's at now.

It's people like this that make Portlanders cynical toward the homeless. You can only deal with so much bullshit year over year, every year, and watch these problems get worse and worse. Rough night, eh? If it makes you feel better I tweeted about how terrible the homeless are.  [deleted] You should try meditation. It is a great stress reliever , and will help you find inner peace We saw all this, too. Proverbially speaking. They will justify their hypocrisy all day long, as you can see. We're talking about people who feel smug after leaving passive-aggressive comments on Reddit, the town is populated by fuckboi memes come to life. They don't understand a word you've written because they don't want to, everything is a joke to them. That's what's wrong with their city. Passive-aggressive until someone wants to talk about something real, then they literally have no idea what to do or say. It was like living with socially awkward babies who had never left a playpen. They are keeping it "weird" alright... I'm white, but Portland made me go running back to a place with fewer strange white people! They don't understand real diversity, integration, etc, and get defensive/angry when the subject is explored ("We're not Portlandia!") Actually in some ways, y'all did look like Portlandia. In that you like to hide the black people and pretend they don't exist there.  Stole my comment. That 5' tall lady that grabs the last exit row seat then proceeds to recline her seat back into the knees of the 6'8" person behind her for the entire flight, ya she's from Portland. Thank God! I was waiting for someone to try and use this excuse!

And you’re getting upvoted so much. Mmmmmm.  Perfect. 

You’re my special lucky person that spouted out your “info” that most are visitors ... and without having any idea at all of what the actual percent of people that fly into Portland are residents or not.

So, please ... share with me how you know most are visitors. 

I want to really enjoy this one, because you already know you’re caught making shit up ... and what’s better is you’re now going to Google trying to find some link that might support the statistic you just made up. 

Note: Just to help you out, remember my story takes place at baggage claim ... so don’t accidentally grab the stats with connecting flights, where they never get off. 

I kind of love you for this.  th-th-this isn't like Portlandia at all! Like I ain't never seen people in Boston ignore homeless folks. Or Houston, or NYC, or Boulder, or Denver, or Chicago, or Miami, or.... How long do I have to live here to be considered a resident? 

Since I’ve already paid thousands in taxes, voted, registered, and work ...

Ah, shit. Now I get it. Once I believe our city is the best and most caring, that’s when I’m a true Portlander.

Haha, love it.  Xanga. Nah, I posted to get some shit fights going. 

It’s like arguing with Mormons. Portlanders get so emotional and irrationally believe our city is so amazing, that the fighting is easy, and makes me feel better.  > Why would a homeless dude go to the airport to use the restroom?

Also, assuming the story's true, why would *anyone* expect people at the airport to stop and become Jimmy Stewart? Many people at the airport are stressed out and just want to get to wherever they're going, either in town or wherever they're headed. I'm not saying it's cool to just ignore people in need. I'm just saying that airports are some of the last places I'd expect somebody to go out of their way to help someone, especially large airports. It *might* be one thing if it's some podunk airport with 3-4 flights a day, like my hometown airport. Even then, people will probably just call for an airport employee to help. I love watching people’s abilities to self rationalize.

Example: Why does it matter to you whether the homeless man was needing help inside an airport bathroom or gas station bathroom?

Does his being in a place he’s not supposed to, because he’s hiding from the cold, make his plight less? Does it make his left leg less mangled? (Note: I’m not a dumbass. I can tell a mangled ass leg about to fall off from some crack head doing the pretend limp )

Seriously think about why the location was so important to you? Would his shivering outside an outhouse needing help make it better?

You think you made good points there, but if you actually think twice about your logic, you’ll realize you’re irrationally trying to protect the image of our precious city.  I assume self statements and admittance that I’m a hypocrite was obvious to you, and that I was talking trash to all my fellow Portlanders that refuse to believe our city is full of hypocrisy too.

I mean, I started out admitting it’s human nature, and I’m just pissed off trying to start an online fight. 

But your argument that Portlanders are all getting hepatitis from homelesss, and they otherwise, if it weren’t for this massive hepatitis scourge that every non-homeless middle income families ... 

Well, you already know I’m making fun of you for saying some imaginary hepatitis outbreak hit non-homeless. 

Oh, and best of all, that only Portland has homeless with hepatitis. 

Anything else you want to add? Any chance we had “The night of a thousand homeless murderers” ... ? Because people don’t feel their taxes, and when they do, they complain.

It’s an empty and easy gesture like Facebooking “Thoughts and prayers.”

Perfect example: A bunch of people complaining about the new funding for the abortion law ... yet we were so proud to pass it and be progressive. 

Do you see the hypocrisy yet? It’s everywhere. Portland is no different. I’m no different. I admit my hypocrisy when I see it ... it’s literally an entire paragraph in my post.

God, I love the self rationalization. Portland has it to the worst with homeless. The homeless are sooo much worse here. That’s the only reason why some guy in terrible need was easily and completely ignored.

You guys are making me feel better. Honestly, I appreciate it. Funny, but everyone has their weird coping mechanism for a bad day. 
 So, the entire post went over your head.

Quick summary: The post was making fun of Portland for thinking it’s a better and more caring city than most others ... when reality is it’s just another city of hypocrisy.

Note: And to add, I never said I was for brotherly love. I even mentioned I didn’t give a shit about most begging drug addicts. 

I like you though. Fucking tear into people. Feels good man.  How? I stated I was already pissed off, and looking to tear into people. 

This subreddit has a lot of people who think our city is soooo awesomely amazing and somehow we’re all better than everyone else. 

So, it’s easy to fight and win, showing we’re not ... like arguing with a Mormon. Makes me feel better to make people question their firmly held irrational beliefs.  Is it because I made fun of Portland, just like I made fun of Idaho?

Does it make you angweees when people criticize your city? Is that your religion ... the glory of Portlandia? I’ve spent year after year with the same thing. I’ve lived here. I’ve lived in Vegas. 

I’ve also dealt with our family locking us inside the house, because my meth-addicted stepbrother just shot our family dog in the head, and said my brother was next. 

And I still helped. Your excuse for Portlanders is still just an exclusive that ignores the reality and statistics that homeless are a problem in many other states.

What about Utah, and their housing programs for homeless that are far ahead and caring than Portland? Racist Mormon bigots cannot possibly care more than Portlanders, right?

It’s funny and sad. I’ve been having some problems that pissed me off, and I knew I could pick a fight and tear into people in r/Portland for believing their city is high and mighty, when they’re not. And that fighting makes me feel better. 

Petty and dumb ... absolutely. I know it is, and I wish I knew some way to feel better without fighting.

But, it still works, and I can’t find Mormons in Portland, like I could in Idaho and Vegas. Trash talking Mormons used to be my thing. Not having many of them here is both a blessing and a curse.

Anyways, it’s even funnier to think how majority of people I actually dig in and argue/fight with on Reddit .. that we would probably be friends IRL, making fun of Mormons together. Yeah, but had enough people comment and fight back to make my immature self feel better. Haha, he did smell pretty horrible.  And wall power sockets are always on other sides of walls. Not easy to see them all. Kind of hidden away.  Yeah, I’ve been listening to a guy’s podcast on it, Sam Harris. 

But he seems like a very calm guy for the amount of anger he should have based on the talks and events he goes to.

I’m now able to recognize arguing with people makes me feel better, and sometimes after I’m arguing with people. 

Slow progress, I guess. Glad you mentioned meditation. It looks very promising.  Wow, you’re way better at writing this. I’m pretty sure I completely understood where you’re coming from, and you explained it in a completely different way. I was not made to be a writer, haha.

But, to be fair, my whole post was just a rage rant trying to get people to take the bait, and fight me. I only did it because I knew people would.

So, I’m no better than anyone else. Plus, I disliked it here from the get go, and never gave it even a remotely fair shot.

Based on your past tense, I’m assuming you moved away? Exit row seats don't recline. Dude, are you off your meds? [deleted] > Example: Why does it matter to you whether the homeless man was needing help inside an airport bathroom or gas station bathroom?

You missed the whole point. He's calling you a liar because your story makes no sense. Also, people in airports are usually on tight schedules. [deleted] Wow... it's almost as though people are individuals.  And not everyone living the same area feel exactly the same way about things.  

It's like saying, "Hey, people from the South are total hypocrites.  I met one white guy in Mississippi who wasn't a racist.  Get your shit together, MS!"

"Fucking hypocrites in Utah.  I met several people who weren't Mormon!"

"This one lady in Canada didn't say sorry to me once!  Damn Canadian hypocrites!" Because people don’t feel their taxes

ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...........

gahead and tell everyone in portland how bad we are, pretty sure you know us all now, were just all urine haters at heart, petty burgeois little barons of luxery, wearing our Patagonia head ware and jogging in ournikeaddidacollumbia shoes........you are pretty pathetic kid, drop me a line when you get a job, pay some taxes and buy some land......I don't really care which order...lol you need some help :) What the fuck are you. Actually no, it’s because you’re acting like s whiny little bitching grade schooler. If you hate it so much here, fucking leave. From the sound of you, few to none will notice or miss your presence here I happen to be a native, from a Mormon family, and have worked with the homeless community for 10+ years.

You just need to change the people you're interacting with on a regular basis. Alot of Portlanders are fart sniffing pussies so overwhelmed with liberal guilt that they can be manipulated into anything. There's exceptions though. I can attest that it's difficult to meet good people here - but anywhere you go there are fart sniffing pussies, or diehard racist rednecks, or dipshit suburban busybodies, or holy-than-thou vain techbros, and a dozen other types of fuckwads.

One thing you can do is work harder than other people around town. As you become a harder work you will encounter higher-quality people. You'll have zero interest in the rando twats debating Trump at the local pub because you'll have actual things to do that are meaningful.  [removed] Funny you bring Sam Harris up. I  really enjoy his podcasts. His last one was on meditation. The experts in that podcast have spent years exploring it.  Hope it works for you Nope. Just picked up my refill at Costco. 

You should come join a bipolar support group meeting, and just listen. 

A lot of crying and misery ... but some are very interesting.

When you have a genetic defect in your brain’s emotions, that can literal take control of your body, both doing and saying things while “you” are in all respects asleep ... you learn hard lessons. From there, you read the current research to best control your problems.

With our defect, one thing we learn is that our consciousness isn’t in control. It was just developed to think it is. Lots of other research on the illusion of free will, but “seeing” is believing. 

To take a page from “The Righteous Mind,” That lesson is your conscious is a dude riding an elephant. You think you’re in control, but you’re not.

And once you begin to understand you don’t make logical choices alone ... that it’s always initiated by an emotion from your brain ... then you realize you’re riding an emotional elephant, and so is everyone else.

Only difference is they don’t know. AND, they don’t want to know.

So, at the end of the day, I just need to figure out your emotional triggers and responses. And there are always core beliefs as strong as an religion ... one of which is the **need** to be a part of a team or tribe, whether your city, politics, or beliefs on economic principles. 

Just look at the replies. I’m insulting the Portland team, so the team comes out and spits out personal attacks and/or “facts” that have no evidence, and they get upvoted. 

And before you think I’m above that, I’m not. I’m aware of a few teams I’m part of, and more I’m unaware of. 

So, if you can find the teams I am part of, and feel an irrationally strong illogical need to protect, then you can pull people like me into arguments, where I upvote comments without evidence, or make my own that are irrational.  One would be seeing people continually supported and approved for making statements that are absolutely false, and completely made up by the person ... all because that person, and everyone who upvoted him, wants to believe it’s true.

And I’m referring to organized religion and falsified medical evidence.

That comment you and others upvoted is just a funny example of the same thing. 

Don’t worry. I’ve upvoted comments I wanted to believe were true, as well.  Haha, fuck me. Didn’t even think about that. Maybe he doesn’t go to the airport around winter. 

Honestly, if I was homeless ... I would try to hide there too.  Lol, that made me laugh, and I have no idea who that guy is. Link to the movie or whatever? Hey, I am OP that was going bonkers, and wrote my post drivel. 

I was re-reading the post and comments today ... sometimes it helps to groan at my immaturity ... anyways, I just saw yours for the first time. 

You got me back pretty well. I chuckled at the last part with the Canadian. That was good, because I could totally imagine my rage-filled self getting arrested inside a Canadian airport, for cussing at people for not saying “excuse me” every 5 seconds. Landowner here who thinks you just made yourself look like a joke and embodied OP's points haha. You talk like the petty bourgeoisie that you are. Also, that hat really does look stupid on you.  Nice.  This is what I like. 

You straw man my argument.

Then you talk down to me. 

Then you talk personal trash at me. 

Because it makes you feel good, as well. We’re all fucked up. I’m just admitting it.  Just a bastard who only focuses on the dark side of human nature / instinct and argues like an asshole ... even knowing he’s being a dumb asshole ... because it makes him feel better.

A guy you could walk by on the street, who looks just like a regular Mormon-looking joe ... who goes out of his way to help people suffering ... while trying to fight with people online and make them feel bad. 

Hopefully this fucked up comment clears it up. And yes, I’m seeking help ... I drop between $2-4k on meds and psych visits each year.

And yes, I come from a family that did a Mormon-style wife swap. It’s more common than you think, especially when you consider cheating Mormon couples do couples therapy with their bishop ... whose normal job is a farmer. 

Any other questions?  So, you’re telling me you didn’t read my posts then take the time to reply, to defend your city. 

What you’re saying is you read my post, and then took the time to talk trash to me ... because I’m being a bitch for talking trash about our city.

It’s one or the other. Either way, it’s just as immature on your part ... and feels pretty fucking good. 

I don’t blame you. That’s what I’m doing too. It’s fucking hilarious, because we all do it.  Now that I’ve had a few days to get things under control, I was re-reading my post, for self embarrassment points ... and I read this comment for the first time. 

Not sure how I missed it then, but I’m glad I did, because I would like to have an actual quick and serious discussion on this. 

You hit a couple things. One is definitely the be-friending thing. I have hickish friends and techno super nerdy game loving Nintendo loving friends, but none here. 

And you’re right. I don’t want to say they’re all self loving fart sniffers. I don’t want to say you’re not wrong, either. 

It’s like each place has its “flavor,” where everyone had to outwardly buy into what others were saying, to fit into their city ... but inwardly they are very interesting. 

What I will say is I believe the outward personality people give off here, to fit in, seems to be very strong ... like Mormon mentality in Eastern Idaho, which I can easily sink into, since I was raised Mormon too :-)

I’m not saying it’s bad. Everyone likes to fit in, and be part of a team. Even I do the same. I used to work UP railroad and country music, and later laugh at funny Japanese TV shows while working in a chem lab. 

I am having serious problems connecting with people here. I am having trouble getting myself to “merge,” if you will. And I didn’t vote for Trump either. But, I admit I don’t detest him.

I’m not a great writer, so I better stop here. I hope I made sense. And if you have any tips or thoughts, I would appreciate it. My SO likes it here, and I’m trying to get myself to, for her ... but it’s not working.  Dude, you made me laugh. Now God’s sending me to hell. Thanks a lot. JK. I already bought a ticket when I left the one true church behind, for a life of sin ... at least the bishop said so. 

All I will say on Reddit is assisted suicide, as long as the provider isn’t forced to do it, should be legalized for adults deemed competent to say they want out.  Hah, that’s awesome. It’s on my play list.

Right now I’m listening to the podcast where it’s a live event with Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and a 3rd guy.

I’m not into Dawkins. But, in this podcast, he keeps randomly hitting with these dry British snide remarks that make me laugh.  Hey friend,

I took a gander at your user history and it looks like you and your doc have been working on some medication adjustment over the past couple weeks—it seems like this may have triggered a manic episode. Do you have someone you could talk to? This time of year is always brutal.

I sincerely hope you’re doing as well as possible given the circumstances.  I hope you feel better, bro.  I don’t need to defend my city, especially to a neurotic little fuckwit like yourself. Do I love my city? Absolutely. Is it some perfect utopia?  Nope.  And yes, you still sound like a whiny little bitch. Don’t like it here or what we say on this reddit page? Leave both. No one is asking you to stay [removed] I’m impressed. Doubted anyone would notice what’s going on. Hell, I keep forgetting. Kind of funny how easily we get used to changes.

I’m as well as can be. Recent doctor visit and meds. We’re not sure yet, so just watching. But, I had to change. Tolerance buildup and preventing/stopping some kind of brain damage they believe is going on. Who knows. 

Anyways, in case you’re interested, Research on lithium is really interesting. Lithium “is believed to be,” as they like to say, one of the best for being neuro-protective from damage.

And, for a lucky few, including elderly geriatrics with dementia, they believe Lithium was actually able to regenerate a significant number of neurons; neuro-regenerative. 

But, don’t worry. This doctor is very smart, and she knows a lot more random medical info than I do. 

Plus, this isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve been through the whole manic episode, from shifting out of depression ... to cops and taser fights, haha.

Appreciate your consideration. And hats off to you for noticing.  Please disregard the other comment. That was a self-hatred bubble. 

Anyways, I sincerely appreciate your help. I wasn’t doing a good job at paying attention to my emotions, and they took over. 

Thanks again. Have a great night.  Please don’t worry about me. I have good family support. 

I fucked up and let the anger train sneak out of the station. I’m really bad at figuring out my emotions have taken full control.  See, you feel better letting it out. 

I’m lashing at our city for being a bunch of bitches with all talk and no walk in “my eyes.”

You’re lashing out at me for being a “neurotic little fuckwit” in “your eyes.”

We’re doing the exact same thing. And, funny enough, I’m pretty sure we both didn’t vote for Trump.

And, I’m sure we both read the “Don’t like Trymp, then get out of our country” mentality printed everywhere, and thought it was the dumbest shit to say. 

And yet here you are doing the exact same thing to me. And, I won’t even pretend I’ve never done that to other people. 

Starting to think you and I have a lot in common, BaconPDX.

I know you are going to be strongly compelled to convince yourself that you’re completely different in this regard.

But just think about it. 

Anyways, using “fuckwit” was good. I like your style.  Haha, dude. Why am I laughing so hard, thinking of portlanders pushing all the crack heads and homeless into the woods by throwing coffee cups at them. 

Stop making me laugh. I’m already going to hell, but I’m trying to at least get the aisle seat when I go.
