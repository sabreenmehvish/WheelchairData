Coaster stuck at Washington Anyone know what happened? >"The woman's companion told FOX 5 he was pushing her across the tracks when the wheel became lodged.  He wasn't able to move the wheelchair before the train hit her."

This is the last guy I want pushing me around. He literally pushed her into an oncoming train and left her there. That's shit they cover on Day 1 of wheelchair pushing school. http://fox5sandiego.com/2018/06/20/train-hits-pedestrian-near-old-town/
 Holy fuck and in a wheel chair? Glad she survived. Right, at least push her off away from the tracks or lift her out of harm's way.  You can always buy a new wheelchair.   Sounds like attempted murder to me  Yeah, and how far away was the train when he tried to cross the track? Were the rails already down? Usually when the guard rails go down to stop traffic, the train is still a decent 1-2 minutes away. He didn't even try to get her out of the wheelchair?! Seems super odd Thank you! Oh no, I won't be having nightmares about that, not at all. :(
