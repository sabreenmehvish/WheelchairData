21/M looking for some new people to hang out with in the Boulder area anyone down? I'm in a wheelchair so I like video games I love trying new restaurants in the area. Also like going to coffee shops, art exhibits, just wondering around, going to movies. I'm down for anything really.  What kind of movies are you into?  Do you like beer? I'm just visiting on semi-important future school business, but if you're into fighting games, I will sincerely make some spare time to hang out! Video games, food, movies and art. Yeah, I think we could hang out. 

What types of movies/video games? All that sounds like a good time to me, too. I haven't been to a movie or anything in a while.
