Denver Comic Con Hi! I'm going to Denver ComicCon this weekend and I'm looking for a lesbian friendly bar (thats handicapped accessible) anyone have an idea?  [Tracks](http://www.tracksdenver.com/) and [X Bar](http://www.xbardenver.com/) are both wheelchair accessible per yelp.  X Bar is still mostly dudes but it seems to becoming the hip happening place for ladies as well. Blush & Blu for lesbians, Charlie's for everything, R&R for a dive.  I think Compound Basix on Broadway would be another option. [deleted] Actually I did but all I found were male bars.. but thanks for assuming I didnt look for myself.
