Dr. D. Baraka Kanaan a former professor of philosophy at the California State University, Long Beach is paraplegic - Delta tells him to crawl in his nicest suit hand over hand through the main cabin floor of the Delta aircraft, down a narrow flight of stairs and across the tarmac to his wheelchair.  There must be more to this story, no company (or employee) is stupid enough to do what was in the article and offer 25k frequent flier miles as an 'opps'.   Wow, that is some seriously fucked up shit. I rarely ever fly Delta, but I will sure as hell not fly with them now. There have been times that I needed a wheelchair and assistance, and American has always been accommodating. I'm not saying that American is the best airline, but that's where my miles are, and they have helped me in the past.  Yeah when I heard this story I thought to myself "do they think they guy would literally crawl all the way back and not tell anybody?" or "is this just some ol' bullshit?" is delta really THAT dumb? There has to be more to this. One answer would be he was asked to leave the plane and didn't want their help so he crawled away to preserve is pride, got to the stairs part and just said "this is bullshit, I'm calling my lawyers!"
