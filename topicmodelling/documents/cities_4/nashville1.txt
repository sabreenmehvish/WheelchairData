Nashville Marine who lost toes to frostbite has wheelchair stolen  Who fucking steals a wheelchair?! Article doesn't state any way to help him out. I'll be glad to throw in for a wheelchair or just get him one. The only street gang I can think of who might need it are the Crips. Wheelchairs are super easy to flip. If it's unbranded, it can get some cash pretty quick on facebook or craigslist. Drug addicts will steal anything not nailed down, and if they have the means, they will even go after things that *are* nailed down. If any of the local veterans' organizations are worth their weight, they'll step up. Actually LOL'd out loud...thanks for making my morning [http://gph.is/1ZJtU9v](http://gph.is/1ZJtU9v) You deserve every bit of that gold. Aww shit you right tho My god. That was good.  Not nailed down: stealable

Has wheels: highly stealable Thanks it's the most money I've made telling jokes lately.
