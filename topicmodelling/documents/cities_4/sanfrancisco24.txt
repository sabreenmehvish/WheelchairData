Man in wheelchair struck and killed by a car early Monday about midnight at Market and Octavia Boulevard near the on-ramp to Highway 101.  This corner is a fucking nightmare, a kid on a skateboard got hit and killed by a car that didn't stop about a year or so ago. The Octavia Blvd on ramp/off ramp is a disaster. Traffic is so much worse than when we would use Fell and Oak for that. Absolutely screwed. [removed] Also the homeless jaywalk across it nonstop on their way to Market Street. I've seen a guy pushing himself backwards through the intersection on a wheelchair using his feet before—I wonder if it was that guy. > The victim, whose name was not immediately released,

> Police have not released further details.

WTF do you expect them to do in a case like this? They gave us all the info that was available. Your disdain is inappropriate to the situation.
 Stop commenting if you have nothing productive to say. TIL that critiquing shitty journalism is unproductive. http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette Yep, no one wants to hear your sarcastic rants. I've removed the post. Take a look at the other posts in this thread for guidances—they attempted to start a discussion off the limited content in the article, rather than just bashing it. And?  What part of reddiquette applies here? Do you just delete posts with down votes or are there some actual rules that I violated? > Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

Most likely this.
