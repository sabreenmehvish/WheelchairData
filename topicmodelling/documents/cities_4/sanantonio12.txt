FREE Comedy Show every Friday  Is it wheelchair accessible? I went to magic time machine for karaoke night once and it wasn't super great. I shudder to think about basement access. Like, how funny are the acts here on a scale of 1-Louis C.K.? I have to admit. The wheelchair access is non-existent into the basement, but any of the comics would be happy to help. It's just incredible that people keep coming out.  Most definitely not wheelchair accesable if it's in the basement. The Blind Tiger is the only alternative comedy club in San Antonio. There have been several national acts to grace the stage: Tom Simmons, Hanibal Burress, Todd Glass, just to name a few. There is a free showcase every Friday, and usually a special event. Like this Friday is SMASH! BAM! POW! Tickets are 10$, but the midnight show is always free.
