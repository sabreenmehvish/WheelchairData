A co-worker of mine is competing in the Ms. Wheelchair Texas competition. I never even knew this existed, but seems to be for a good cause! I thought I'd share.   She's lovely. Wish her the best of luck from reddit! Good luck!!   MacArthur!   Cheers for MacArthur High and growing up in Irving.  your friend doesn't have a leg to stand on! Thank you! Will do. She's an awesome lady, and definitely isn't one to piggyback on her disability. She works harder than just about everyone there.  &#3232;\_&#3232;
