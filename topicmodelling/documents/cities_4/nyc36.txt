Kind of late, but I thought I'd share this photo I shot at the Chinese New Year Celebration.  Chinese person here.

Chinese New Year...meh. I like it when we still had fireworks. Made things more festive. Now, it's more of an obligation and for tourists than it is to celebrate. i was there, in my wheelchair and with a friend. it was cool.  i am a water dragon. the last time was when i was born, june 1952. i've waited for this day. soon, i will get out of the wheelchair and be normal again.  it's been nearly 2 years.  cocaine is a terrible drug. i found out one day too late. hmm, is that Mott Street? Fantastic photo. I miss the fireworks days too. Hell, I missed when Chinatown actually felt like China. It's very gentrified now. I've been living in NYC my entire life, I'm 25. Ditto, upvote for you! Yes sir! I hear Flushing looks more like the old Chinatown. Too bad I've never stepped foot in Flushing. It does actually. I used to hang out there often. If you take the 7 to Main St (last stop) it will be almost like you're in a totally different world.

Almost.
