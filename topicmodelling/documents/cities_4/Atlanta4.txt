Woman with MS says Delta employees tied her to wheelchair  I get this probably looks bad, but I’m sure it wasn’t done with malicious intent. Somebody was trying to make do with the tools they had at the time to assist them getting through the airport. The alternative at that point was to just leave them sitting there for however long it took to get the right chair. Instead somebody was trying to help and probably asked if this was ok. Neither the lady nor her son spoke up and said no.  Not Delta employees.  Airport contractors. Probably, but they leave people sitting on planes for a lot of dumber reasons than getting the right chair for a person in need.
