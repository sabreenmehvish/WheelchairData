Help my handicapped friend find an apartment that is wheelchair accessible!  What is your friend's budget? That's kind of important when apartment hunting. He's asked that I post this here. I thought it was a clever way to try and find a roommate / place to live I actually have a room in my apartment opening up next month. The building is ADA compliant! It's also on the pricier side, though.  Way to be a bud. You need to ask Jake (and report back here) how much he can afford for an apartment. Otherwise he might only hear from places outside his budget, which can be frustrating. Just a heads up.
