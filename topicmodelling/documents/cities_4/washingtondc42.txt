WalkingTown DC 2018 September Neighborhood Tours **WalkingTown DC** is DC's best public tour program, featuring more than 50 guided walking tours in neighborhoods throughout the District.  This popular annual event takes place annually in September and introduces residents and visitors to the art, culture, and history of Washington, DC through a series of "bite-size" lunchtime tours, after-work "happy hour" tours, and longer weekend tours. The tours will be from September 15 to September 23. 

WalkingTown DC connects you to well-known and unfamiliar places, from Congress Heights to Herring Hill, St. Paul's Rock Creek Parish to Dupont Circle. Tours are led by historians, licensed tour guides, community leaders and business owners, enthusiasts and docents, who all donate their time and expertise for this annual festival.

Tours are offered at varying lengths and fitness levels, so it is easy to find a tour that is right for you. All tours require reservations and are free and open to the public.  Many tours are wheelchair and stroller accessible.
