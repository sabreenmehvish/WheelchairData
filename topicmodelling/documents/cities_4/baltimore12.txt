Someone stole my fiance's sisters motorized wheel chair (again) in Hampden... Any help would be appriciated. http://i.imgur.com/ildkKOJ.png

This is the 2nd time this has happened, which is sad to say the least.  

It is a blue motorized wheelchair stolen in Hampden, off Falls Road just of 83 about an hour ago. http://goo.gl/maps/q8hqf 

Cops have been called, but kinda shrugged at the situation.

PM me if you have any info.
