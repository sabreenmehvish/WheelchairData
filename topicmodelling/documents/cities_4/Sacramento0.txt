Seeking wheelchair-accessible activities in and around Sac My wife is recovering from a recent leg injury. When we leave the house, she primarily relies on a wheelchair.

Seeking suggestions for wheelchair / ADA accessible activities, attractions, things to do around town so she doesn't get stir crazy at home. TIA. Try the Independence Trail, on Hwy 49 just the other side of Nevada City  California has really strong ADA laws, so basically any activity that normal people can do should be accommodating to those with a disability.  Yeah most things are moderately accessible here. What kind of stuff are you guys into? 

Thereâ€™s museums: train, auto, Crocker art, California museum, etc 

Breweries, wineries (old sugar mill), bars/restaurants, music venues etc.
