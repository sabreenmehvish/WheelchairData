‘I’m not a good thief’ – Airport employee arrested for stealing $800 from blind passenger's wheelchair  At least he's honest "I'm not a good person"  

FTFY Wow. If you're casually stealing from a blind person in a wheelchair, what else are you capable of?  Airports have cameras **everywhere**. Definitely not a good thief.
