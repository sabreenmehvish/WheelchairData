Looking for people to interview about mobility and accessibility in San Diego Do you have physical mobility impairments and want to make your voice heard? We want to interview you!

As part of a DSGN 100 project for UCSD, my group and I are conducting interviews on the topic of accessibility and mobility in San Diego. We want to know the real issues people face while traveling around San Diego by any method (bus, wheelchair, Uber, etc.) If you have physical mobility impairments or know someone who does and might be interested in participating in an interview, please contact me!

We are also interested in contacting senior citizens who live in San Diego, so please also contact me if you know anyone in that demographic who would be willing to do an interview.

(For the purposes of this project, a physical mobility impairment is any condition that causes you to require accommodations to travel, whether that is something physical like a cane or something functional like buzzers at crosswalks. If there's a better term for me to use please let me know.)
 My father is in a situation like you described, and San Diego is pretty fucking amazing when it comes to accessibility  You may just want to contact the senior center and see if you can come by and ask questions. You can find senior centers by calling 211 San Diego  or just searching Internet I'm sure. That's great to hear! Do you know what sort of services he uses, by any chance? We are also interested in how people with mobility impairments feel that other people perceive them, so if you can recall any comments about how the San Diego public is in that regard, we would love to hear them. My team has already reached out to quite a few centers and organizations, but thank you for the advice! :)
