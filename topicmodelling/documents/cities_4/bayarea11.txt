Palo Alto man in wheelchair struck in hit and run. Police are looking for a white Toyota Yaris with damage on the front passenger side.  This sounds horrible... But was the victim really wheeling his wheelchair on the actual road? University is a mess and space on that road can be quite tight. :/ Why was he out at 4 in the morning? There are bike lanes on that section of University, and since he ended up on the grass I assume that's where he was. Why was the driver out at 4 in the morning? :( that's fucked up Maybe out partying and was drinking and driving, or maybe he works early.

Still, I think it's stranger to see someone in a wheelchair at that time of night. Disabled people usually aren't out much...
