Is it possible to rent a wheelchair in DC? Hey all

My parents are set to come up to the city to visit this weekend, but my Dad had a bad fall and can barely walk. He's going to get better, but definitely not until after this weekend. It's his birthday and I really don't want him to be confined to a bed for most of his visit.

Does anyone know if it's possible to rent a wheelchair for a weekend? Looks like Lenox Medical Supply can hook you up - and they'll deliver and pick up the chair:

 The Mount Olivet Pharmacy behind Gallaudet University has them too, almost got one from them for my mom to use while I graduated.

If the hotel doesn't have one, or Lenox seems pricey, let me know.  I use one, but I've been lucky enough to have gotten up onto crutches in the past few weeks.  It'd be easy for me to let him borrow it for the weekend. how generous. I love it! That would be wonderful and thank you! Good news is he said he's feeling better today and has been able to walk a bit. Keep an eye on your messages and I'll get in touch tomorrow if his condition gets worse.

Either way you are awesome. That's awesome!  I'm glad to hear that he's getting back on his feet.  Hope the rest of his recovery goes well.
