DEAR PORTLAND: May 08, 2017 WEEKLY RANT THREAD GREETINGS HUMANS. PLEASE TELL ME YOUR MISFORTUNES SO I CAN LEARN THE CONCEPT OF EMPATHY. 

Caps on, inhibitions off, but if you break our rules so help me I'll delete my account.  And yours.
 MY WIFE'S FAMILY DESCENDED ON OUR HOME THIS WEEKEND LIKE A FLOCK OF ANGRY PARROTS.  MY EARS ARE STILL RINGING WITH THE GHOSTS OF THEIR JUNGLE CRIES.  NO ONE WAITS FOR ANYONE TO FINISH SAYING ANYTHING, THEY JUST TRY TO TALK LOUDER TO BE HEARD.  THEIR VOLUMES GO TO 11. I WENT OUTSIDE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE AND MY NEIGHBOR CAME OUT AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED YELLING CURSES AND HOCKING LOOGIES. I FUCKING HATE YOU MAN.  OUR RECEPTIONIST JUST HANDED ME A STACK OF DOCUMENTS AND THERE WAS A BOOGER ON IT AND I TOUCHED IT. SOME ENTITLED ASSHOLE FELT THAT HIS QUESTION TO THE BUS DRIVER WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE SHOULD CLIMB ONTO THE WHEELCHAIR RAMP THAT HAD JUST BEEN LOWERED FOR A WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR AND BLOCK HER FROM GETTING ON THE BUS. I TOLD HIM TO MOVE FOR THE LADY IN THE WHEELCHAIR AND HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I'D JUST TOLD HIM TO GO FUCK HIS MOTHER. FUCK PEOPLE WHO TAKE UP SPACE MEANT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WAY TOO MANY MOTORCYCLES SPLITTING BETWEEN CARS! I KNOW THE WEATHER'S NICE AND I WANT LANE SPLITTING LEGALIZED TOO, BUT IT'S STILL ILLEGAL HERE. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO OVERCOME THE STEREOTYPE OF LAWLESS DONORCYCLISTS IF A FEW BAD APPLES KEEP REINFORCING IT. WHY DO PEOPLE PAY FOR TICKETS TO A SHOW WHEN ALL THEY DO IS TALK DURING THE PERFORMANCE? I'M SO SICK OF IT; EVERY TIME I GO SEE COMEDY OR STORYTELLING THERE IS SOMEONE NEAR ME BEING TOTALLY OBNOXIOUS. DO WE JUST LACK ETIQUETTE IN THIS TOWN? IS IT A GENERATIONAL THING? IT MAKES ME FEEL CROTCHETY AT AGE 34. IT WAS INEVITABLE BUT MY LANDLORD IS CONSIDERING SELLING OUR LITTLE HOUSE WHICH I LOVE.

WE REALLY WANT TO BUY IT OFF HIM BUT NO GUARANTEES. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO BE COMPETING WITH OTHER BIDDERS. :( MY PARENTS ARE VISITING IN A WEEK, AND I'M ALREADY DREADING IT. I LOVE THEM, BUT THEY ARE THE MOST HIGH MAINTENANCE VISITORS EVER. APARTMENT HUNTING CONTINUES TO SUCK I AM GONNA REACH DEEP INTO MY NOSE AND WIPE A HUGE GRODY BOOGER ON THE NEXT CAR I PASS THAT IS PARKED 2 FEET FROM THE CURB, PARTLY IN THE BIKE LANE.
 [deleted] WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT ON YOUR PHONE AT 7:30AM ON THE BUS? FROM WHAT I COULD OVERHEAR, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  HEY OUT-OF-STATE PLATES GIANT TRUCK SMALL PENIS DRIVER-
WE USUALLY STOP FOR PEDESTRIANS WHO ARE TRYING TO CROSS THE STREET, ESPECIALLY AT DESIGNATED CROSSWALKS, NOT SPEED UP ONCE YOU SEE THE PED. MAKING AN ATTEMPT TO CROSS. YOU ASSHOLES.  I DON'T HAVE MONEY. OR EVEN A PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS.

BUT I SWEAR THAT FUCKING BIRD THAT SHIT ALL OVER MY WINDSHIELD WILL *PAY*.  A SPIDER BIT ME ON THE PALM OF MY HAND, RIGHT ON A CREASE LINE. NOW EVERY TIME I MOVE MY HAND IT IRRITATES IT AND MAKES IT ITCH LIKE CRAZY. UGH! IF YOU'RE TRAVELLING WEST ON WEST BURNSIDE AND HAVE TO GO TO THE STARBUCKS THAT'S NEXT TO ZUPANS, YOU'RE A TOTAL TURD SUCKER. TRY GETTING YOUR SHITTY FLAVORED CAFFEINE AT A LOCATION THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE TAKING A LEFT THROUGH BACKED UP TRAFFIC.  I REALLY WANT TO START PLAYING MUSIC AGAIN, BUT I JUST GET ANXIOUS EVERYTIME I PICK UP MY GUITAR. I BOUGHT A DRUM SET, AND HAVE A GUITAR AND EVERYTHING I NEED TO START RECORDING AGAIN, BUT I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO PUT ANYTHING TOGETHER. I'M AT THE POINT WHERE I'M CONSIDERING JUST SELLING ALL MY MUSIC STUFF, OR THROWING IT OUT. [deleted] IF I HAVE COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND YOU ARE A PEDESTRIAN, DON'T FUCKING WAVE ME THROUGH THE CROSSWALK.  I NEED A JOB SO BAD IM GOING OUT AND SPREADING MY RESUME LIKE A PLAGUE BUT I CANT MAKE IT PAST THE SECOND INTERVIEW FUCK [deleted] THE RV AND TOURIST SEASON HAS STARTED! EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THE EFFECTIVE SPEED LIMIT DROPS TO 30 MPH ON ALL OREGON HIGHWAYS AT ALL TIMES UNTIL OCTOBER. 

ON A POSITIVE NOTE, WE'VE BEEN HAVING A GREAT WEATHER LATELY!  MY PARROT WONT STOP CAWING FOR FUCKING ANYTHING.  I FEEL BAD BECAUSE ITS SPRING AND HE IS UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE HE HAS SO MANY NEW FEATHERS BUT HOLY SHIT PLEASE BE QUIET FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES! THE STICKERS AT FREDDIES ARE GONE! SOMEONE STOLE THEM DAMN IT.  WHY OH WHY CANT YOU JUST USE YOUR FUCKING TURN SIGNALS?  I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA YOU'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO TURN UNLESS YOU TELL ME. PEOPLE LIKE YOU KILL PEOPLE ON BIKES. FUCK YOU. 

P.S.  TURNING YOUR SIGNAL ON AS YOU YURN DOES NOT FUCKING COUNT.  I PUT IN A QUERY ABOUT REFINANCING AND NOW EVERY SLEAZELORD FROM HERE TO MONTAUK IS CALLING MY PHONE ALL THE TIME, HALF OF THEM ARE FUCKING ROBO-CALLS.  IF YOU COULD NOT BE BOTHERED TO SEND AN ACTUAL HUMAN BEING *WITH* A MORTGAGE LICENSE, I WILL NOT BE CONSIDERING YOUR SERVICES AT ALL. ALL THESE FAIR WEATHER FUCK SACKS HAVE TAKEN OVER MY FAVORITE BAR. FUCK YOU, GO FIND ANOTHER BAR TO DOUCHIFY   I JUST DRANK AN IPA AND I LIKED THE DAMNED THING! I LIKE STOUTS, NOT IPAS.  I BOUGHT A BIKETOWN MEMBERSHIP FOR THE SUMMER AND TOOK MY FIRST RIDE.  NEWSFLASH: EVEN FLAT-LOOKING ROADS IN PORTLAND ARE HILLS. I WAS WHEEZING AFTER 30 SECONDS AND HAVE GIVEN UP THE DREAM OF CRUISING VARIOUS CLOSE-IN NEIGHBORHOODS DURING SUMMER EVENINGS LEST I TERRIFY SMALL CHILDREN AS A RED-FACE ASTHMATIC COW ADVANCES UPON THEM.  WHEN DID I GET SO OUT OF SHAPE? ~CRYFACE~ SO FUCKING TIRED OF YOUR DOGS IN BARS. I COME HERE TO RELAX, NOT TO START A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH A STRANGER'S NOSE IN MY CROTCH. YOUR DOG ISN'T SUPER SPECIAL AND NEITHER ARE YOU. IT MAY BE WARM OUTSIDE AND I MAY HAVE A GREAT VIEW FROM MY WINDOW AT WORK, BUT THE BOILER IS OUT SO I AM SITTING IN MY OFFICE WRAPPED IN A BLANKET BECAUSE IT IS FREEEEEZING  Just heard an old white guy yell "Go, ya dumbass n***er!" to the black guy driving in front of him. I hope he wrecks his shitty truck and gets a dui. CAN WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE LEFT TURN LIGHT FROM GLISan ONTO 60TH?? WHO DO I HAVE TO WRITE? THE GREEN LIGHT NEEDS TO BE TWICE AS LONG I SWEAR TO GOD THE HOMELESS SITUATION IN THE PARK BLOCKS HAS GOTTEN 300% WORSE SINCE LAST YEAR. WTF ARE THEY ALL DOING. AT LEAST THEY USED TO NOT ALL BE COMPLETELY OBNOXIOUS ASSHOLES. TIRED OF NEW STOP SIGNS POPPING UP RANDOMLY ON ROADS WHERE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY NO NEED FOR THRU TRAFFIC TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP, OR SLOW AT ALL! It's sunny and I'm trapped in the office all day! I JUST FOUND OUT ITS CALLED "SIZzlepie" AND NOT "sizzle-PIE" AND HAVE BEEN SAYING IT WRONG FOR YEARS I AM GETTING MARRIED ON SATURDAY AND THE WEATHER WENT FROM AMAZING TO STANDARD PORTLAND!! FOR THE LOVE OF LIFE PLEASE STOP WALKING ACROSS AN INTERSECTION WHILE WATCHING YOUR CELL PHONE. GREEN WALK SIGN, FLASHING SIGNALS, "RIGHT OF WAY" WONT HELP YOU WHEN YOU BECOME A REAL LIFE VERSION OF WILEY COYOTE! MY CAR DOESN'T HAVE A SUNROOF. I PUT SOUND DAMPENING FOAM IN MY PC YESTERDAY AND IT'S STILL LOUD. I THINK I HAVE COIL WHINE, WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY HARD TO FIX. UGH. I WILL PROBABLY NEVER GET TO FUCK THE WEEKND.  TOOK A DIGGER ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS ON THE WAY TO WORK THIS MORNING. NO HARM DONE BUT AFTER THIS AND TWO FLATS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS I AM BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT 1) I'M CURSED 2) I REALLY SUCK AT BIKE COMMUTING 3) MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR NEW TIRES HAD A DAMN LONG DAY AT WORK, MISSED A MAX, GOT HOME STARVING AFTER ALMOST 2-HOURS OF COMMUTE, SAW SOMETHING GRILLING WHICH INSTANTLY MADE MY MOUTH WATER, WAS SURE IT WAS A BUNCH SAUSAGES. NOPE. DAMN GRILLED CARROTS. IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN!

TRIM BACK YOUR FUCKING BUSHES AND HEDGES FROM THE SIDEWALK SO PEOPLE CAN WALK WITHOUT DUCKING AND WEAVING!!!!!!!!!1 IF POOPING IN PUBLIC INVOLVES A LOT OF GUTTERAL MOANING, MAYBE SAVE IT FOR HOME!

 ALSO, I TURNED OFF THE LIGHT ON MY WAY OUT TO HELP YOU RELAX! OH GAWD. YOU KNOW WHAT'S MY WORST PEEVE WITH REGARD TO THE DYNAMICS OF A CONVERSATION? WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU A FRIENDLY QUESTION AND CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTS WHEN YOU TRY TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTION. THEN, IT DIGRESSES TO A COMPLETE NON-SEQUITUR. AND, REPEAT THE MADNESS.  CAN WE PLEASE ACHIEVE SOME KIND OF CIVIL EXCHANGE LIKE ADULTS? JUST READING THAT GAVE ME A HEADACHE! I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW IT MUST HAVE FELT.  RITALIN? YOU SHOULD SEEK TRAUMA COUNSELING ASAP. OH WHAT THE FUCK! IS SHE CUTE? fuck people who think a person in a wheelchair can't wait a fucking minute. [GOOD THING IT'S NOT BANGKOK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CaGt-W2uDw)

I WAS THERE AND THAT SHIT SCARED ME TO DEATH.  WHERE ARE YOU SEEING THIS?  I RIDE, DON'T SPLIT, AND CAN'T RECALL SEEING OTHERS SPLITTING MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.  (NOT DOUBTING IT HAPPENS, AS I'VE SEEN OTHER REPORTS, I'M GENUINELY CURIOUS ABOUT WHERE FOLKS ARE SPLITTING.) STILL PISSED OFF AT THE LOUDMOUTHED COKED-UP BITCH WHO COULDN'T STOP TALKING DURING LOUIS CK'S SET A FEW MONTHS AGO.  RUINED OUR ENTIRE EVENING I'M CROTCHETY AT 30. I FREQUENTLY ASK PEOPLE TO PLEASE TAKE THEIR CONVERSATIONS TO THE LOBBY. [deleted] PEOPLE WOULDN'T SHUT UP IN THE BALCONY AT THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS SHOW A FEW WEEKS AGO. I WOULD HAVE MOVED BUT I HAVE FUCKED UP FEET AND NEEDED TO SIT. MY #1 PET PEEVE!!!!!!!1 THIS TURNED INTO A GROUP SHAMING EXERCISE AT PJ HARVEY. SOMEONE EVEN HAD THE GALL TO SAY "SHHH!" WHILE A CIRCLE OF PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE LOOKS AND GLARES WERE IN PROGRESS. LET HIM KNOW NOW BEFORE HE GETS AN AGENT. SAVING THE COMMISSION AND HASSLE IS WORTH A LOT TO SOME PEOPLE. SOMETIMES ADDING A PERSONAL TOUCH BY WRITING A LETTER CAN HELP IN THESE SITUATIONS. IT LIKELY WON'T CAUSE THE LANDLORD TO REDUCE A MARKET ASKING PRICE, HOWEVER, HE MIGHT TAKE YOUR BID WHICH MIGHT BE AT ASKING OVER SOMEONE BIDDING 20-30K OVER.  GOOD LUCK!!!! MY PARENTS VISITED FOR THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR AND STAYED AT AN AIRBNB DOWN THE STREET. IT WAS AMAZING AND I WANT THEM TO DO THAT EVERY YEAR. YOU CAN RENT THE 2BD NEXT TO ME FOR $700, MINE IS NICER BUT I HAVE TO PAY $775

/HUMBLEBRAG THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE THIRD BOOGER POST TODAY, DOES EVERYONE HAVE BAD ALLERGIES ? SYMPTOM OF CROSSOVER CULTURE. THESE DULLARD APES CAN'T SEE FUCK ALL FROM INSIDE THE BULBOUS GAS BLOAT OF THEIR STUPID UGLY CAR-SACK. WATCH OUT FOR THE 100'S OF BLACK TACKS I LEFT IN THE BIKES LANES ALL OVER TOWN THIS WEEKEND. "BUT HAVE *YOU* HEARD THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, MR. REMINGTON?

"FURTHERMORE, PLEASE WITNESS THIS."

*GESTURES DOWNWARD.  SLAMS DOOR.*

IF YOU'RE NOT BRUCE CAMPBELL, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.  PLEASE LET ME HAVE THIS. Being naked in your house and yard are not illegal in portland.   THATS ABSURD, ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE AS ARMED AND NAKED AS YOU LIKE

FUCK JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES AND THEIR DISRESPECT OF DOOR SIGNS

YOU DID ALL RIGHT BY ME DA LIKELY WON'T PROCEED.  YOU EXPOSED YOUR GENITALS, BUT YOUR INTENT WAS NOT TO AROUSE SEXUAL DESIRE OF YOURSELF OR THE JW LADIES.  

https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.465 IF [THIS GUY](http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/07/northeast_portland_man_who_str.html) CAN BEAT THE CHARGES, I CAN'T SEE WHY YOU COULDN'T.  UNLESS YOU CHASED THEM BACK TO THEIR PLACE OR SOMETHING. [deleted] JEHOVAH ISN'T EVEN A VALID WORD. SOMEONE MIS TRANSLATED YAWHEA AT AT SOME TIME AND PLACE  LOL, i INSTALED A PEEP HOLE  FOR JUST EXACTLY THIS, I LOOK OUT, AND IF THEY SEEM "WITNESSY" i JIGGLE THE LOCK, AND THEN WALK AWAY....SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED SO FAR, BUT YOUR IDEA SOUNDS LIKE THE BEST IDEA LOL. WAS IT A LOT OF: "LIKE" AND "AMAAZING"? CHEERS. I AM IN CALIFORNIA THIS WEEK FOR WORK, I WAITED LIKE 10 MINUTES TO CROSS THE ROAD ON A MARKED CROSSWALK. I MISS HOME. THIS STATE BLOWS.  I'VE BEEN RECENTLY ENJOY CARS THAT HAVE SPENT AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME PARKED UNDERNEATH ONE OF THEM FLOWERY TREES. ALL THIS RAIN MIXED WITH OCCASIONAL SUNSHINE MAKES IT LOOKS LIKE THE TREE TOOK A THOUSAND FLOWERY SHITS ALL OVER THE CAR. GET SOME CORTISONE?

2nd NOTE, BUY SOME FOR THE MOSQUITOES THAT COMETH IN SUMMER WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY!!!!!!!1 FUCK EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN WHO TRY TO TAKE UNPROTECTED LEFTS. RELAX, MAN.   PLAY ALL OF THE SONGS THAT MADE YOU PICK UP THE THING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  GET YOUR CHOPS BACK.  HAVE FUN. LET'S JAM!!!  I PLAY DRUMS MOSTLY, BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS WITH GUITAR AND BASS.  NOT OVERLY TALENTED OR ON A MISSION TO BE FAMOUS -- JUST LIKE TO JAM OUT BY MYSELF AS A SORT OF CATHARTIC EXERCISE.  PERHAPS A SUPER-LAID-BACK SESSION WITH AN INTERNET STRANGER WILL SPUR THE CREATIVITY YOU FEEL IS MISSING!

TOTALLY NOT KIDDING.  I HAVE AN ELECTRONIC DRUM SET, ELECTRIC GUITAR, AND A BASIC MIXER, SO WE COULD EASILY JAM ON HEADPHONES IF IT'D BE HELPFUL TO KEEP THE NOISE LEVEL DOWN.  PROBABLY NOT FEASIBLE TO PLAY AT MY PLACE (THOUGH NOT TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE), BUT I HAVE A STATION WAGON THAT IS SEEMINGLY BUILT TO HAUL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.

SHOOT ME A PM IF YOU'RE AT ALL INTERESTED -- SERIOUSLY!

EDIT: Should also mention I'm fairly versed with Reaper, GarageBand, and most of the big name DAWs.  I have a MIDI keyboard, and probably 20+ unfinished songs, beats, grooves, etc. that we could easily use to springboard the aforementioned jam sesh.   I SAW A GUITAR FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER THE OTHER DAY. GET REALLY HIGH AND JAM, IF YOU STILL WANT TO THROW IT OUT DO SO, IF NOT KEEP JAMMING.  MENTION IT! DO IT POLITELY AND HE MIGHT JUST HAVE SOMEONE WELD ON A $20 GLASSPACK AND MAKE YOUR LIFE TOLERABLE.  AT LEAST THEY ARE OUTSIDE AND NOT TEXTING IN A BAR I HAD A PARROT FOR MANY YEARS AND I'M SORRY, BUT FUCK PARROTS REMINDS ME OF MY LIBERTARIAN FRIEND WHO'S CONSTANTLY PREACHING ABOUT BOOTSTRAPS AND THEN TRIED TO CROWDFUND HIS VACATION. There are surely bird rescue groups that could enrich his life. If you chose to surrender him. THE CHANGE HAPPENS SUDDENLY. I WAS A 'I DON'T LIKE HOPPY BEERS' WHINER FOR OVER A DECADE. ONE MORNING I WOKE UP AND IPA WAS THE ONLY BEER I WANTED. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND 'OLD' ME. BROWN ALES? REALLY?  DONT STOP! IT WILL GET EASIER, YOU WILL GET INTO SHAPE!  I WILL BE HELLA PISSED IF YOU STOP NOW. KEEP DOING IT. IT WILL GET EASIER. I'M EXCEPTIONALLY MIFFED BY ALL THE STOP SIGNS IN ROUNDABOUTS. IT DEFEATS THE GOD DAMN POINT. WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING!?!?! SAME. TELL YOUR BOSS TO FUCK THEMSELVES AND LEAVE EARLY.  DOESN'T MATTER HAVE A GREAT WEDDING.  YOUVE GOT A WHINE ALRIGHT [deleted] YOU NEED A REDNECK STETHOSCOPE, I SUGGEST PLASTIC SO YOU DONT GET ZAPPED. WHATS A REDNECK STETHOSCOPE YOU ASK? ITS A ROD YOU HOLD ONE END TO WHATEVER MAYBE MAKING NOISE AND THE OTHER TO YOUR EAR, YOU HEAR WHATS CAUSING THE VIBRATIONS. 

WAIT NO JUST TURN UP THE VOLUME, FIXED! THAT'S A REAL ASSHOLE THING TO DO TO SOMEONE WHO'S ALREADY HAVING AN AWFUL TIME. TBH IF YOU HAVE TO SHIT IN PUBLIC ITS PROBABLY BECUASE YOUR GUTS ARE IN TROUBLE. I hope someone fucks with you for no reason!  IT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. MY NOW EX WIFE DID THAT SHIT ALL THE TIME AND I GOT ANGRY AND SHE NEVER ADJUSTED. 12 YEARS. HER WHOLE FAMILY DOES IT. 

HER DEFENSE? "I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE A CONVERSATION" 

NO, BITCH, YOU'RE INTERRUPTING, PERIOD.   I MEAN, SHE'S NOT REALLY MY TYPE BUT SHE'S ALSO ABOUT 30 YEARS MY SENIOR. W-WHAT? FOR ME IT'S USUALLY WHERE I405 CONNECTS TO I5 SB AT THE CURVE AND SUBSEQUENT MERGE OOOOOH! I REMEMBER THAT ONE! COUPLE ROWS OFF THE STAGE? RIGHT? I'M SO ANXIOUS ABOUT GOING TO SHOWS ANYMORE BECAUSE I'M SENSITIVE TO MY SURROUNDINGS AND REALLY IRKED BY OTHER PEOPLE'S LACK OF CONSIDERATION. WE DID! HE SEEMED POSITIVE ABOUT IT. I SHOULD SEND HIM AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT WITH 'WE WANT TO BUY OUR LITTLE HOUSE PLEASE' ON A CARD WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A COUPLE YEARS SO HE KNOWS US PRETTY WELL. I WOULD BEG THOUGH

I REALLY DO LOVE OUR LITTLE HOUSE WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU HAVE A 2BD FOR LESS THAN 800? MY RATHOLE APARTMENT IN TIGARD IS ABOUT TO GO UP TO 900! YES AND A GODDAMNED SINUS INFECTION FUCK YOU SEASONAL ALLERGIES.  I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE DOWNVOTE A JOKE LIKE THIS. I MEAN IF YOU'RE SERIOUS THAT'S ACTUALLY A CRIME AND FUCK YOU BUT I THINK IT'S A JOJE. [deleted] NONETHELESS, PROBABLY NOT WORTH RISKING THE CHANCE OF A MINOR BEING PRESENT. NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A CHILD SEX OFFENSE CHARGE ON YOUR RECORD, EVEN IF YOU EVENTUALLY GET IT DISMISSED OR REMOVED.


ALSO, "HE WAS JUST A BOY, (GRAVELY) UH-HUH." "SHOULDN'T UH DONE THAT." JOHN BRENNAN IS A HERO OF PORTLAND! [deleted] IT WAS THE MOST BANAL SHIT EVER. OH, AND AT ONE POINT, THE GIRL ASKS THE PERSON WHERE THEY ARE WORKING NOW...WHEN SHE WENT TO HANG UP 5 MINUTES LATER SHE SAID I LOVE YOU BEFORE ENDING THE CALL. HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU BE THROWING THAT PHRASE AROUND AT SOMEONE AND NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEIR JOB IS?!?!?! 

I WAS CURSING MYSELF FOR LEAVING MY EARBUDS AT HOME. "ONE OF THEM FLOWERY TREES"

ARE WE KIN? I'VE SEEN THOSE AROUND-TRAILING FLOWER PETALS AS THEY ARE DRIVEN THROUGH THE CITY. 

WAY, WAY BETTER. UGH, MOSQUITOES. IF I'M IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THERE ARE MOSQUITOES NO ONE ELSE WILL GET BIT BECAUSE THE LITTLE BITCHES WILL BE TOO BUSY BITING ME AND I'M MILDLY ALLERGIC TO MOSQUITO BITES.  [deleted] [deleted] WHAT'S THE TITLE OF THIS THREAD? HM. I HAVEN'T TRIED THAT. MAINLY BEEN PLAYING STUFF THAT I HAD WRITTEN BEFORE THIS DRY SPELL, BUT NEVER REALLY DID ANYTHING WITH. I WILL HAVE TO GIVE YOUR SUGGESTION A SHOT. THANKS! MIX ALL THAT SHIT UP AND HIT ME UP! I'LL MASTER IT! 

AND JAM!  I DON'T SMOKE OR DRINK, AND I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. WHEN I USED TO SMOKE/DRINK I WOULD WRITE STUFF LIKE CRAZY. NOW I OVERTHINK THINGS, I THINK. I HOPE SO. THANKS! I WILL TRY, I PROMISE! THEY SHOULD BE CHANGED TO YIELD SIGNS BUT WE DEF. NEED SOME TYPE OF WARNING AS PEOPLE DRIVE ON AUTO PILOT AROUND HERE AND WOULD BE COLLIDING CONSTANTLY. You have css turned off so you can't  see the caps 

AHHHHH GOT SOME CHEESE TO GO WITH IT? IT'S A CONSTANT DRONE THAT GOES IN AND OUT IN FREQUENCY. NOT CORRELATED WITH CPU OR GPU LOAD. NOT HHD BECAUSE I HAVE NONE. I HAVE RUBBER GASKETS ON ALL MY CASE FANS .... MAYBE CPU COOLER? PRESIDENT MACRON?   I SEE IT HAPPEN HERE TOO!!!
 SHOW HIM YOUR OWN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT, IF HE'S, YOU KNOW, INTO THAT FRIENDS OF OURS TOTALLY DID THIS WITH THEIR LANDLORD. FOLKS SOLD THEM A HOUSE WITH MULTIPLE RENTAL UNITS FOR WAAAAY LESS THAN MARKET VALUE AND A FHA LOAN IN THE MIX (<--WAH?!), "COS THEY'D TAKE CARE OF IT." HOPE COULD BE ALL YOU NEED! WISHING YOU A GOOD OUTCOME HERE.  60'S AND FOSTER, NOT ADVERTISED, WORD OF MOUTH, SMALL COMPLEX, LOCAL OWNERS THAT TRY TO BE ABSENTEE LANDLORDS. DEFINITELY A JOKE, I CAN'T AFFORD TACKS. THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT OREGON WAS PRETTY CHILL ABOUT NUDITY IN GENERAL, ESPECIALLY IN HOMES.

IT SEEMS LIKE VINDICTIVE PUNISHMENT TO ME.

I DON'T THINK THAT JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES SHOULD BE OUTLAWS UNTIL THEY FAIL TO RESPECT YOUR SOLICITING SIGNS.

IMO YOU SHOULD DIRECTLY TRESPASS THEM NEXT TIME THEY ARE ON YOUR PROPERTY. CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE MY STYLE OF RESPONSE, BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO WORK. [deleted] FIGURED OUT I WENT THE WRONG ROUTE, SO I GOT WITH A SICK ASS CREW AND WENT ALL OUT.  THIS IS COUNTER TO WHAT I LEARNED IN MY DEFENSIVE DRIVING CLASS. WHO AM I TO BELIEVE?? Complain about legal things? Idk THE BEST ADVICE I EVER GOT WAS THIS:  "THINK OF THE WORSTE FUCKING SONG EVER,  AND THEN WRITE IT."  ONCE YOU E WRITTEN THE WORST SONG EVER YOU CAN ONLY IMPROVE, PLUS IT HELPS YOU GET PAST THE INTERTIAL BARRIER. YOU'RE NOW RES TAGGED AS "PRO BONO MASTERER / PDX JAMMER".  WOULD BE VERY COOL TO TAKE YOU UP ON THIS! [deleted] YEP. THATS YOUR PROBLEM. I STILL SMOKE AND DRINK AND HAVE NO PROBLEMS.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! [deleted] LONG SHOT, BUT COULD THE CASE FANS BE PRODUCING SOME KIND OF BEAT FREQUENCY BY SPINNING AT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RATES? THANK YOU! I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I HAVEN'T RESORTED TO WITCHCRAFT YET BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION [deleted] HOW MANY SQ FEET? [deleted] HAHA. I'M SO UNHAPPY WITH EVERYTHING I WRITE LATELY, EVERY SONG IS THE WORST SONG. DO IT!!!

Send me an email: info@onairmastering.com Absolutely, send me an email: info@onairmastering.com WELL, WEED MAKES ME EXTREMELY PARANOID, AND I AM/WAS AN ALCOHOLIC. NOT TO MENTION THAT I LIVE IN A SOBER HOUSE, SO I NEED TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. THANKS BRO. IT'S BEEN FLAWLESS UP UNTIL NOW. I THINK THE WHINE IS RECENT. BRAGVERTISED I'M GONNA NEED ABOUT 350. 

MY PLACE IS 650+, NEIGHBORS IS ABOUT 600 [deleted] WELL, I HAVE WRITTEN LOTS OF CRAPPY SONGS THAT WHEN TAKEN TO WHATEVER BAND I'M IN AT THE MOMENT TURN OUT PRETTY COOL THROUGH COLLABORATION.... THIS RANT MADE ME THINK OF YOU:

http://zenpencils.com/comic/90-ira-glass-advice-for-beginners/

PLEASE READ IT FOR ENCOURAGEMENT. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, HERE'S THE TLDR: YOU STARTED BECAUSE YOU LOVE MUSIC AND HAVE GOOD TASTE. GOTTA KEEP WORKING TO IMPROVE THROUGH THE PHASE WHERE YOUR OWN WORK MAKES YOU GAG. TOTALLY NORMAL PHASE FOR AN ARTIST.

CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR WHAT YOU COME UP WITH! THERE IS NO WAY YOU WROTE ANYTHING AS DREADFULLY FUCKING I-WANT-TO-JAM-A-SCREWDRIVER-IN-MY-EAR TERRIBLE AS 'WE BUILT THIS CITY,' BY STARSHIP YOU'RE NOT FUCKED, YOU'RE AWESOME.  INSTEAD OF TRYING NOT TO BE STRESSED, DO THE OPPOSITE.  VISUALIZE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN.  MAKE IT REALLY BAD.  ONCE YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT, THEN BAM, SOBER JAM UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME.  I BELIEVE IN YOU. SHIT, SOUNDS LIKE YOUR FUCKED, SORRY MATE! [deleted] I DON'T PLAY WITH ANYONE. I HAVE TRIED TO A FEW TIMES, AND ONLY ONCE HAS IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE IT MIGHT WORK. I'VE RESOLVED TO JUST DOING EVERYTHING BY MYSELF NOW. WHICH, ADMITTEDLY, MAY BE SOME OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL. THANK YOU. THAT WAS VERY RELEVANT. THERE DEFINITRLY IS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT IN MYSELF. LOOKING BACK AT WHAT I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN AND PUT OUT THERE, AND FEELING LIKE MY NEWER STUFF JUST ISN'T STACKING UP. SO YEAH, THANKS FOR THAT. LOL. I SURE HOPE NOT. THE SUSPICIONS THAT I HAVE THAT MY FRIENDS ARE LYING TO ME WHEN THEY TELL ME THAT THEY LIKE MY STUFF WOULD BE CONFIRMED IF SO. THANK YOU. LOOK PERSON IT IS LIKE THIS.  I HAVE NO ART TALENT AT ALL, NO MUSIC, NOTHING, ZERO.  I ACCEPT MY FATE IN THIS.  BUT IN SQUANDERING YOUR GOD GIVEN TALENTS, WON'T YOU PLEASE THINK OF THE SYNTHESIZER?
 THAT'S THE THING THOUGH. WHAT IF I HAVE BEEN FOOLING MYSELF ALL ALONG AND IT'S REALLY NOT ANYTHING VERY GOOD? I WROTE SAME BASIC EASY STUFF AWHILE AGO, AND EVENTUALLY JUST LOST ALL CREATIVITY? THAT'S WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH. LIKE, AS SOON AS I PLAY SOMETHING, AND I DON'T LIKE IT, I JUST START THINKING THAT I'M TAPPED. AND HERE I THOUGHT WE COULD BE FRIENDS, NOW I'M MAD (I'M NOT REALLY MAD)  LISTEN, RECORD SOMETHING, PM ME A LINK WHER EYOU UPLOADED IT AND I WILL JUDGE YOU HARSHLY.  THAT WAY YOU CAN BE MAD AT ME AND NOT PARALYZED BY SOMETHING THAT HASN'T EVEN HAPPENED, [deleted] I WILL DO THAT. MAYBE I WILL WRITE SOMETHING THAT I HAVE IN MY HEAD, BUT JUST DIDN'T THINK WAS VERY GOOD. TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, I DIDN'T EXPECT ANY REPLIES TO MY RANT. THE AMOUNT THAT I RECEIVED THOUGH, HAS MADE ME FEEL ALOT BETTER ABOUT THE WHOLE THING AND I REALIZE THAT YEAH, MAYBE I JUST DO NEED TO GIVE IT TIME. THANK YOU. I MEAN DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT SUCKS TO HEAR SOMETHING "BAD" FROM SOMEONE ELSE AND TO KNOW YOU COULDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO THAT?  SO YEAH SEND SOMETHING AND I WILL BE JEALOUS AND CRITICAL, LOL. HAHA, SOUNDS GOOD. I'VE SAVED YOUR COMMENT AND WILL BE SURE TO SEND YOU SOMETHING ONE DAY.
