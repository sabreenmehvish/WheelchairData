Sidewalk Snow Removal Door Hangers The city has door hangers available for print if you have any problem buildings or businesses in your neighborhood: https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdot/pedestrian/sidewalksnowremoval/Door_Hanger.pdf

It seems like *a lot* of people neglected to clear their snow yesterday since it only snowed "a little bit." Although it was an icy mess out there today.  I saw a disabled woman struggling with her wheelchair this afternoon.

Another 1-2 inches is forecast for tomorrow. I want to print out like 800 of these and start throwing them around my ice-laden neighborhood like a crazed Oprah. YOU GET A DOOR HANGER, AND YOU GET A DOOR HANGER, AND YOU GET A DOOR HANGER! no one on california from the blue line to armitage clears their sidewalk. looking at you and your shitty vacant lot, masada We have one problem owner on our block. He is a retired CPS principal who drives a Jaguar and is 
perfectly able-bodied. 

He never shovels his sidewalk, which he has neglected to the point that it has cracked and partially collapsed square segments - making it more difficult to self help and just do the shoveling myself.

Next snow he gets a door hanger. TY

My walk to the Clinton blue line today past union station.

Amen, brother. I saw one embedded in the ice on the sidewalk on my walk to the L this AM... Does anyone know what exactly happens when you file a 311 complaint against addresses that don't shovel? There's a house down the street (of course, the biggest, most expensive house) that never shovels and I keep reporting them, but nothing's really changed. You can file an online 311 report with the city here. If they're old people that can't shovel, give em a hand. But for the person who reported Mr. Jaguar, light him up.

Is this business only or are residential buildings required to shovel.~~
--edit nevermind it's written right there on the damn thing.  Not telling anyone that sticking a sticker on some old person's door is a bad idea,  but the thing is,  you can spend just as much effort with a shovel fixing the issue and being less of a dick.   (residential only)  EVERYONE GETS A DOOR HANGER! I believe that stretch is city owned. So good luck getting them to clear it. They often have a different set of rules.  My mom used to take a box or 2 of table salt in her bag in winter because she had to walk past several city-owned, never shoveled/salted areas on her way to work in the 80s/90s. It was slow going, but after falling once she was determined not to let it happen again and it worked for her. (Yes, it's ridiculous anyone should have to do such a thing, but it's a better solution than walking in the street or breaking your bones...) ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

On Saturday, I rang the doorbells of neighboring buildings on my block that clearly shoveled the walkway from their gate to their building, but not their sidewalk. There are a lot of elderly and disabled people in the neighborhood and I've come to see a lot of them walk in the street in the winter to avoid the mess. o dang  yeah, i think rentals owners that arent doing their job as landlords should be stickered, but you cant just blanket the neighborhood with "you should be shoveling"  stickers.  Sometimes the folks who own those houses are unable.  And deserve a hand instead of a sticker.  
 There is a 311 category for requesting snow clearing for elderly/handicapped residents. However, these are buildings that deliberately shoveled path ways from their building to their gate and their gate to the street but not their sidewalks.
