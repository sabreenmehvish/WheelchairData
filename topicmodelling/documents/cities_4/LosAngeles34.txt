Handicap Accessible Housing Resources? Hey r/LosAngeles! My sister (who uses a wheelchair) is moving to LA soon but she's having trouble finding handicap accessible apartment listings, etc. Many that claim to be ADA compliant simply are not. This is true for any Craigslist postings and even Westside Rentals postings.  I'm normally good at doing Internet research but I'm coming up very dry.

My hope is that someone might be able to point me in the direction of good resources for finding handicap accessible housing? Or maybe someone has experience with a similar situation? Or even a web community dedicated to living in LA while disabled? I couldn't find a subreddit specifically for that.

For reference, her budget is about $1,100 per month and she'd like to have a 1BR somewhere near East Hollywood (which is where I live).

Thanks! Er... that sounds like a tall order, even *without* extra considerations like needing to be wheelchair accessible. I'd strongly suggest looking somewhat further afield, maybe even considering teaming up and looking for a two-bedroom. Just food for thought, I now return you to your regularly scheduled et cetera... xD
