Medical supplies/help for invalids Recently I found out about a family's unfortunate situation. They are originally from Mexico and are here only because their 21 yr old son, who  was in the U.S. to work, suffered an accident that has left him as an invalid, confined to a wheelchair. They don't have much, just enough to get by but with no jobs or finances they struggle with getting him the basics like adult diapers, or even food sometimes. Is there anyone local that knows where I can direct them to for supplies and things like that? I will add their status in this country is not exactly legal. I appreciate any help or guidance.
