Reasonable private-pay wheelchair Uber/taxi service? I am looking for any kind of accessible taxi service in Vancouver/Portland. The ones I have found (Mercy 1, Golden chariot, etc.) would cost $80 round-trip, or $25 + $5 per mile. This seems several times more then traditional taxi services, and I guess I understand why. Any suggest alternatives for those who can't take public transportation. Trimet has a lift service that's $5 a ride. You have to buy the tickets and schedule with some advance time (not sure how much). Here's a piece of advice that's worked for me:

Call your preferred taxi cab company locally, and request an accessible van taxi for your trip. When the driver arrives, get his/her cell number. For future trips, instead of calling dispatch one can call the driver personally and request a ride. 

Obviously this is not ideal, but my experience has been that I tend to get more reliable transportation with this method.

 I haven't used this here in Portland, as I have a car, but in both Las Vegas and Brooklyn, I found that to be the best way to get an accessible ride. And of course if one can tip well, that certainly doesn't hurt.

Best of luck!

(BTW, I think a lot of those "medical transport" places charge exorbitant prices because they're generally covered by third-payers. Such a racket.) I'm 100% sure there is some excellent public transit option for you, just have to look around. [deleted] Thanks a lot for the advice. I haven't tried calling a local taxi because I have never seen an accessible taxi, and so just assumed. Gotta give back to the community.  It's an important service. I'm pretty sure they all have some accessible taxis in their fleet. You're very welcome! Good luck! :)
