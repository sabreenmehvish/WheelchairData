Looking for people in wheel/mobility chairs to take harbor tours! Offering free tours in exchange for feedback Do you know anyone who uses a wheelchair who might enjoy touring the harbor or Gaslamp?  
I just finished building a pedicab that is wheelchair accessible,  it's the first and only one of its kind,  built here in San Diego,and I am eager for folks to try it.  
It has room for 2-3 adults,  as well as a person in a wheelchair.  
Please either reply in the comments or send me message and we can make arrangements.  
Thanks

Pictures of the vehicle I don't know anyone but that seems like a great idea! Especially over near the midway and north - a lot of path changes and potholes that might make it hard for someone in a wheelchair to get around. Plus it can get crowded. Dude that looks awesome!, if I lived in San Diego, I'd totally do this.  I aspire to live there one day.  This is only increasing that aspiration.  I like this idea. Are you sure you have no one else in San Diego offering this? What made you create this? Is pricing you advertise all customers the same I assume?  I have not found another pedal driven vehicle that can hold a wheelchair and passengers anywhere in the world.
For many years customers have said to me "this is the most fun I've had all visit". Making that experience available to people who aren't usually catered to is my inspiration for building this.  
For now,  pricing is all donation based.  
Thanks We should talk. Maybe we can market this idea? I’m an entrepreneur here in SD.  You’re probably already pursing this on your own, so no worries either way, but great idea regardless!
