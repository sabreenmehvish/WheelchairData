From the people who hosted Reddit Thanksgiving 2013... ADX 3rd Birthday Bash: 06/07! DISCLAIMER:  This karma-free post is advertising an event for a business.  This event will not cost you money.  This event will, however, require you feast on delicious smoked meats (and not-meats), drink free beer (and cider), utilize large hammers in a competition, and/or possibly watch drunk people use high powered lasers while hilariously failing at 3D printing.

The table saw and welding equipment, however, will be unplugged, locked, and probably under armed guard during this time.

Here's your [invitation](http://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=R5Rs9k4cmJo&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKzEdVcylj30%26feature%3Dshare).

Details: Sat 6/7, goes from early afternoon to around 9 (likely later...), 417 SE 11th.  Oddly, close-toed shoes suggested.

RSVP if you can (or drop me questions) in comments below - and ideally on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ArtDesignPDX) so we can make a good beerstimate.

Everyone welcome - bring friends, we're family friendly (if you're at least semi-adventurous), wheelchair accessible, etc etc etc. Goddamnit mike, plan around MY schedule. How many ADX posts will be thrown on this sub? Its like more than one daily. Gosh! Your schedule is to come to the party.  STOKED TO SEE YOU!

See?  Now you're coming.  Mandate + guilt = Win! Ack, someone else posted it I see - and twice... ah well.

Also, I think I know who they are and should probably let them know to not double-post :)  Thanks for heads up! I have a bachelor party to attend, we shall see. Pfft.  Does your bachelor party have lasers?  I remember a certain wallet (and money, and cards) we didn't get to finish accidentally cutting through...
