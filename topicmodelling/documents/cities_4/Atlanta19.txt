Wheelchair donations in Georgia? Where can I either donate a wheelchair and/or suggest people to go to get a wheelchair if they cannot afford one? FODAC (Friends of Disabled Adults and Children) accepts donations and gets durable medical equipment distributed and low and sometimes no cost. www.fodac.org  you can also find reuse options across the country at www.passitoncenter.org. I work for our state's Assistive Technology Act program, Tools for Life, www.gatfl.org. Hope this helps! Also, we have the state's alternative financing program, Credit-Able (we do low interest small loans for assistive technology, like power chairs and other items for daily living) Yep, FODAC. Thanks!
