Chickenfoot at the AVA Amphitheater - May 31, 2012 I stood, mouth agape, for an hour and a half tonight, watching this man's fingers dance up and down the fret board. It was at the same time both exquisite and rueful, knowing that in my wildest, fondest dreams, I could never play guitar as amazingly as this man. Watching Joe Satriani play guitar is like watching Wimbledon from a wheelchair.
