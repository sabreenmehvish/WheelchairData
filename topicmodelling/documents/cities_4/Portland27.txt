Found Motorized Wheelchair in NW. It looks like someone took a motorized wheel chair for a joy ride and ditched it. Anyone missing their ride?
Edit: The brand is Quantum, pics in link below.

I am still looking for my scooter. Please keep your eyes peeled. I am so appreciative. Thank you Odie. I drove down there, but none were mine. However I presume they are stolen, as there are no keys, battery, or cord for charging. I have reported to the police. Often there will be a sticker on the chair indicating where the it came from - if you give them a call, they can probably find out who the owner is. I know it's not your responsibility, but it would be a really nice thing to do - motorized wheelchairs often cost $5-10k or more. Where in NW? There's that rehab clinic on 20th pl & Everett that has a ton of people in motorized wheelchairs. Ambulances are there 6-7 days a week responding to medical emergencies. If it's near there, I would check with the clinic to see if someone was transported from the street in an ambulance and had to leave the chair. Good on you for trying to find the owner. Callahan  I posted a link to some pics. Please have them take a look to see if it's there's.  Yes, this is the thing to do. If there's a phone number on there, they'll be able to identify it and get it back to its owner.  Who?
