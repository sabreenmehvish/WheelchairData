Where can I get a cheap plastic lawn chair in Cap Hill? I have a friend visiting who is in a wheelchair and it would be easiest for her to shower while in a chair. Does anyone know where can I buy a cheap plastic lawn chair around Capitol Hill? I can always drive to Target or something, but would prefer to find something close by. Any ideas? Does anyone have one they want to get rid of?

EDIT: Thanks everyone! For future reference, Sports Authority supposedly has them for 6 bucks. I ended up borrowing a bath stool from someone off Nextdoor. Try Ace Hardware at 9th and Corona. they always have some on craiglist.  maybe try putting this on r/denverlist too Try the Ace on 12th I actually called them already, but no luck. Thanks! Yeah, they're kind of hit or miss with things.  Maybe the Goodwill down Broadway? I know it's not Cap Hill but they always seem to have random furniture in there.
