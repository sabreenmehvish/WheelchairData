Please, please, PLEASE stop giving up the right-of-way when driving Almost got into an accident this morning because someone decided to come to a complete stop on a street that had no Stop sign or Yield sign. 45 miles an hour to a complete stop in 1 second so that he could let a bus, which was waiting at a Stop sign, pull out and turn left into the on-coming lane. Unexpected idiocy like this is what causes accidents. Follow the rules of the road. You're not being rude by retaining the right-of-way, your being predictable which is what everyone else on the road wants.

Edit: to those few who believe I was tailgating, 45 mph to 0 mph in 1 second and no collision. Just slightly soiled underwear and a ruined morning because of some asshat wanting to unexpectedly yield right-of-way to a bus. If I was tailgating I would have either hit the car in front or gone into the on-coming lane and hit the bus or gone onto the sidewalk.  Also: Use all lanes to the merge then zipper in, every-other car. It's the law. Merging half a mile before then splitting lanes to prevent anyone from utilizing an open lane is illegal. 

Edit: http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2055.pdf

USE BOTH LANES TO THE MERGE: Blocking an open lane is ILLEGAL. Also, for the love of all that is holy, do not give up your right of way to me when I am on a bicycle. It all works better when we all behave predictably. I know you think you are being all magnanimous by stopping when you shouldn't. But you aren't. You are stacking up cars behind you, making it more dangerous for me. Let me decide when it is safe for me to come out into the intersection - I ride my bike thousands of miles annually, and I have a good idea about this. You, doofus motorist, do not. Driving in Seattle is merely a way for people to demonstrate who was raised better. Like... just GO. You're making traffic worse for everyone behind you just so you can make it better for one person who has to figure out what you're doing, rather than doing the predictable thing.

Also, hogging the left lane so that I have to pass on the right. Or, hogging the left lane so that I have to pass on the right but then you realize you're doing it and change lanes in front of me so I can pass you on the left instead.  I commute south on 405 by merging on from Bellevue way at I90. Nobody wears their bigboy pants to that exit and everyone tries to play dumb (or not) and prevent me from merging. I used to get so god damned angry. 

One day on my lunch break I read the wikipedia entry about VY Canis Majoris. On that day, while driving home I was thinking about VY Canis Majoris. The sheer size of it. Something happened. Something clicked. It was nothing. Literally nothing. I didn't *feel* anything. It's not like I tuned it out. I'm totally mentally present, but I have no feelings about the situation. 

People were merging, not letting others merge, being childish, whatever and I felt absolutely nothing. If someone wants over, I let them over signal or not. It doesn't matter what other drivers do, it just doesn't bug me anymore. 

I don't know how to explain it but now I drive every day in Seattle traffic and I am completely, blissfully numb. I don't know if anyone can relate to this, but there it is.  [deleted] Much worse are horrific accidents caused by drivers stopping  to let pedestrians cross in unexpected places, with fatal results when the polite car is rear-ended and slams into the pedestrians. Two toddlers and their mom died that way near here not long ago.  Wow, half of you guys are so gungho to pin blame on the OP for tailgating. You don't seem to realize that OP obviously left enough room in front of him to stop, ergo he was not tailgating.  

If someone comes to a sudden and unexpected stop in the middle of traffic, a near miss is all but guaranteed because that is how momentum works. The only other option other than a near miss is when you actually are following too close and cause an accident. [NW Relevant] (https://youtu.be/8aIfarMPmPQ)  Also, putting on your blinker doesn't magically give you the right of way to change lanes. If there's a car there you need to adjust to them. I've been cut off so many times by people who think that blinking light means everyone must suddenly bow down and yield to them.  My partner totaled one of our cars this way - he (stupidly) took a left hand turn across two lanes when the person near the center lane let him through.  Along came one of those handicapped vans in the other lane - SLAM!

I was attempted a left hand turn onto an arterial; guy stops his car to let me turn.  I refuse.  He keeps insisting - I keep refusing (in pantomime).  During our exchange...another car passes him on the shoulder, on the right.  I then try to pantomime: "SEE...SEE...THAT is why you don't DO THAT!!!!" ITT: Seattleites complaining about things Seattleites have always done and will continue to do because passive-aggressiveness and social awkwardness is in the water here.  "Go! It's not a crosswalk! There's no stop sign! Go! I'm not crossing in front of you! GOOOO!"  

Almost every day. Sometimes I have to turn around and walk a little way back up the sidewalk before they go.

edit: It turns out I am, in this matter at least, kind of a  jackass. As /u/gingerpanduh pointed out below, every street corner is an unmarked crosswalk. I say "kind of" because it seems counterintuitive. Seattle drivers are passive to the point of being dangerous. First thing I noticed moving from the East Coast. Granted, I'm used to a Mad Max-esque free for all on a highway but still, there needs to be a happy medium right?

I legit have people not only sit in my blind spot for miles, but they will buy a home and raise a family back there. It's like dude, come on.  Yes, please. I've nearly gotten in accidents with people while I have been walking or biking, because they thought they were being courteous and watching out for me, but what they have done is disrupt the order. You suddenly stop to let me bike by, and the guy behind you has to swerve around and nearly hit me. Stuff like that. What makes traffic safer is predictability.  Post all you want but it won't make a difference. People will never, ever stop doing dumb shit on the road. where in seattle is it 45mph speed limit with unprotected lefts turning onto it? After coming here from Chicago, where its like death race, I find the 4 way stops with 4 vehicles at a stand still all waiting for the aloof person on the corner not yet ready to cross the street, downright hilarious! It's like some other planet. I agree. A friend of mine was on a motorcycle and stopped very quickly for pedestrians that were wanting to cross mid-block (jaywalking, and were not actually in the street). The car behind him slammed into him and he ended up in the hospital for a week. Technically it's the driver's fault for hitting him, but that could have been avoided by not suddenly stopping for pedestrians that did not have the legal right of way. 

Also, can people please use their blinkers, turn lanes (stop making a right turn from the center lane), and merge at the merge points not a mile ahead (you create more traffic problems by doing this). https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/why-last-second-lane-mergers-are-good-for-traffic.html?mcubz=3 Sure I caused a ten car pileup, but now random strangers know I'm a nice person! THE LEFT-MOST STANDARD LANE ON THE HIGHWAY IS FOR **PASSING**. IF YOU ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO PASS SOMEONE DO NOT GO INTO THE LEFT-MOST STANDARD LANE.

*pant*, *pant*.  not related to this particular issue, but people in Seattle, please don't stop for school bus when you are on road with 3 or more lane. People don't seem to know the traffic laws in Washington State. On 3 or more lane road, you don't have to stop for oncoming school bus even if it has the stop sign up and flashing.  Or the idiots that let pedestrians cross when there's no crosswalk or pedestrian crossing sign! I always have to slam my brakes. As a pedestrian, it's super annoying, I will J walk when you're not there. As a driver, it's downright dangerous and cause a pile up. You're not being nice, you're being an idiot. I agree with you that altering expected right of way is dangerous. But, I'd like to add that following too close is also dangerous.  Logged in just to upvote. This is a problem all over Washington recently. What drives me bananas is when there is a dedicated right turn lane with a dedicated merging lane after the turn and the asshat stops in the turning lane because there are cars in the non merge lane. Grow a pair, get in the merge lane, and merge into traffic you pansies. 45 MPH to zero in one second is 2.05G's, which is about double what a high performance sports car can do. Physics says if you were in a pretty normal car and hit the brakes to the point the ABS went off, this took 2.5-3 seconds. Was stuck in deadlocked rush hour morning traffic because a intersection light was blinking yellow. This somehow caused rushour traffic to treat it as a stop sign to allow the extremely light side traffic to go. So every single car stopped each time. Backing up the traffic for miles. 

It was an absolute mess, just because people don’t understand that you’re supposed to drive through caution lights.  Coming from a State where drivers handle pedestrians by speeding up and turning on the wipers, please appreciate what you have. Also if someone is driving like a dipshit honk your horn! Fuck those people. Stop in the middle of the road to wave across some guy running.  You’re not being nice. You’re holding up traffic and making everyone else feel awkward.  I work between Seattle and LA. And I can safely say, Seattle drivers are fucking dangerous.  I live in Pittsburgh and this is one thing that is common place here. It pisses me off to no end! They even call it the 'pittsburgh left'.  How about we all just drive and stop trying to be nice and just follow the god damn driving rules. Why is that so hard?! I don't disagree, but you're yelling into the void here.

I grew up in a smaller town outside of Seattle and was such a polite, relaxed driver. 

Now, I'm a complete asshole. I do not let anyone inconvenience me. Try to merge from the onramp 1/2 mile before the onramp is done? I'm passing your ass on the right. Trying to stop me from merging in gridlock traffic for no reason? I will literally keep going where I'm going, it's your choice whether or not you want to hit me, I'm not going to stop so that you can needlessly block me off of the freeway. Lay on your horn all you want. Going 20mph in a 30mph side street? I'm going to pass you. Again, your horn does nothing.

Before you get after me about safety: I'm always paying attention before I make a dumb move, I've never put anyone in danger. Just lots of salty tears from other drivers. I've never lived anywhere where people will just stop for someone WAITING to cross the street at a corner with no sidewalks. It's fucking dangerous!  

Edit: thanks for schooling me. Seems like a totally crazy law. Wish driving laws were consistent between the states. Next time, the car could have stopped for a pedestrian instead of a bus. Slow down and leave more space. Regardless of who was right or wrong, if you almost rear end someone, you're the wrong one.  OMFG, YES!!!!
 Interesting note that the law here is the same as in LA. I once had a friend there who go a ticket for driving by a pedestrian who was across the street just as they took their first step off.
  
However, if you don't like pedestrians you should move to Montreal. There the pedestrians do not have the right of way, and you need to have your shit together to cross the street or you're gonna get mowed down.  Never! It's my right of way, I will do with it as I please! /s This is the shit that makes me miss small towns.

People just forget how to drive in Seattle I swear. YOU HAVE RIGHT OF WAY, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS MAKING ME WAIT BECAUSE THE SECOND I START TO GO, YOU'LL START TO GO THEN WE HAVE TO START ALL OVER. relevant:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aIfarMPmPQ Not ITT: the people who need this driving advice. Everyone going slower than me is an idiot.  Everyone going faster than me is a maniac!

I still agree with you though. :) Thank you!  Stopping to let someone in when they would be able to drive 2 seconds later if you just kept driving is not being nice if is hazardous to the people behind you and confusing to the person you're yielding to  As a cyclist that obeys traffic laws, I get pretty irate when folks try to let me go out-of-turn. No, I'm not going to be a part of you fucking everyone else up, and possibly wind up run over through people's confusion, just so you can wave me through so you don't have to make a conscious decision about your driving habits.  Also, pedestrians: please don't cross streets without stopping and preventing the traffic already stopped there from going. If they were there before you, stop and let them go. You can pass behind them. lol when seattle people's overpoliteness on the streets takes a new turn. i don't live there anymore but felt like a king on the street while walking.  I moved here from LA a few years ago and nobody seems to understand when I say that Seattle drivers are the most passive group of people I have ever seen. It's like people think they are being kind and courteous when really you're just endangering others with your shitty driving. There is a definite trend of general passiveness and non-confrontation with a lot of people here and it's pretty interesting how much the driving habits reflect that. Yes! **And** the law in Washington State is: **Drive Right** **Pass** **Left**
[Why You Shouldn't Drive in the Left Lane](https://youtu.be/4oqfodY2Lz0) Nothing gives me rage quite like these asshats that pull this bullshit.  It's just straight up dangerous! That shit happens all the time here... Seattle's overly cautious/overly courteous drivers putting everyone else at risk. My wife and I call this The Seattle Polite Game. He who causes the most headache for others under the guise of politeness, wins. It drives me nuts. Ugh!!! I've seen people done this in Toronto. Utterly annoying!!!!  See this sort of stuff all the time. 

Also, left lane is the passing lane on the highways. Don't drive there unless passing or going fast. 

Also, see DOT research on why merging at the LAST MINUTE speeds up traffic. You aren't an asshole for blowing past all those people waiting in that line. They're making things worse! Thank you! this is high on my list of why Seattle drivers are absolutely terrible. Sure, they don't drive fast but that almost makes it worse. Just because you arn't speed doesn't mean you are a safe driver. I really really hate Seattle drivers. Also, if your wipers are on, your lights should be on. I don't know if it's the law or not, but it's just common sense. THIS.  As a biker I have seen accidents caused by people who felt they would like to be polite to me, instead of following the rules of the road. As a bicycle commuter, so much this. Seriously, cars need to drive predictably so bike riders that rely on timing and coasting can know when to go and when to stop. Also, waving me on at a four way stop when you were clearly there first is not doing me a favor. I was going to enjoy that 5 second break while you took your turn, and now everyone else gets to wait and watch me lumber across the intersection. Thankkkk youuuuuu, Hero OP. >...someone decided to come to a complete stop on a street that had no Stop sign or Yield sign.

There are [Yield signs on buses](http://nakedloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/KC-metro-bus.jpg). 

And it is the [law](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.220) that buses have right of way, so long as they signaled, and there was enough time for traffic to stop.  3 seconds or 3 car lengths. Whichever is longer. That's your minimum following distance. You were tailgating. I totally agree with you, but you were also tailgating. Those aren't mutually exclusive. You should be able to stop with ease even if someone does something dumb in front of you. > a street that had no Stop sign or Yield sign... so that he could let a bus...

Buses carry moving Yield signs. Here is a photo of the back of one: http://nakedloon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/KC-metro-bus.jpg. Look at the left side. See the Yield sticker there? That is a fully legally enforceable Yield, indistinguishable (in the eyes of the law) from one attached to a pole. If the bus was moving, the other driver had to stop or it could have been charged with failure to yield.  [deleted] It's not me, it's you!  All of you.  You're the issue!  There's no way things could or should be different in other places!  Why don't you invite me to your barbecues?  How can you say, "Have a great day," to me and then not want any more interaction with me?  

Seattle, bitches. You go! You taught SO many people a lesson here! Problem solved! Thanks for fixing us! [deleted] Where were you driving that allowed for 45 mph and had a stop sign? This sounds like an arterial road to me and pretty sure the speed limit on all arterials is 25mph. So you were going 20 mph over the limit and pissed at someone else for actually following the law. Pedestrians have the right of way. Period. At all times. "Drive like hell, you'll get there"  Sorry, but slowing down or stopping *never* causes accidents.  I don't recommend suddenly slamming on your brakes unnecessarily. But if it leads to an accident it's because the car behind you failed. 

I think there are acceptable times to yield a right of way.  Let's face it, there are places no one could ever get onto the street without it. But it shouldnt involve slamming the breaks or 4-way stops!
 [deleted] This happens every day I get on the highway! There is a half-mile of road to use to merge at-speed with traffic; you don't need to come to stop at the bottom of the on-ramp with your blinker on and wait for traffic to slow down to get over! People in Seattle do NOT know how to zipper merge. [deleted] The problem is that it is not the law in many states. I know in at least 2 nearby states you are told to merge as soon as possible, not at the last minute.

Edited to respond to the previous comment's edit:  You only only mentioned using the lane all the way to the merge was state law,  that is not the law or policy in many other states.  Riding the line or driving halfway between the lanes is stupid and illegal in ALL states, but was not what you were talking about initially. It's actually NOT  the law.- "The responsibility to safely merge into traffic from an on-ramp lies with the driver of the merging vehicle, Traffic on the freeway has the right of way. There is no law that requires a driver occupying the right lane on the freeway to move over, slow down or take any other action to let a merging vehicle on the freeway." 

Quoted from a washington state trooper in 2014 Question - Where the West Seattle Bridge merges onto I-5 North, there is about 1/4 to 1/2 a mile that's technically a onramp to I-90.  People will get off the West Seattle bridge, go all the way to the end, and then try to merge onto I-5.  Is that zipper merging?  Cause the dumb fucks are stopping in the middle of a lane that should be moving freely, in my opinion.  I typically dip in to a gap in cars when I'm merging, if that's at the end of the onramp - fine.  I just feel like people use the term 'zipper merge' to do dumb shit.  People don't zipper merge in LA or Denver, they just create gaps and fucking let people in.   Never more evident than on the Myers Way on ramp to 509N in the mornings. Because of this, other a-holes use the shoulder to bypass dozens of cars to get ahead, which is also illegal and can cause an incident.  Proof: https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/why-last-second-lane-mergers-are-good-for-traffic.amp.html Also, if someone is doing the right thing and zippering, don't choke them off at the merge point. Allow them in gracefully. But if the signs saying a lane will end are a mile in advance, it doesn't hurt to scoot into the other lane as soon as you can. 

And if some shithead decides to go 20 over to try to pass everyone else via a "zipper merge" that only they are performing, then fuck'em, I'm not letting them in.  What a relief. so it is ok to use the "lane ends merge left" lane to cruise by everyone who already got over so I can zipper in at the front of the line. this will make things much easier for me. How's it work if I'm in the right lane about to turn right, and you're in the bike lane next to me but behind me, but the amount of time it takes me to turn would result in me causing you to brake or hit me? Do I activate my turn signal, wait for a few extra seconds to pass (probably resulting in me doing a full stop), or do I turn in front of you and force you to brake? I was on a bicycle at a stop sign at a T intersection near Green Lake. The vehicle on the road slowed down to let me cross. They had no stop sign. I waved for them to continue on and they then flipped me off. They went from generous to butthurt in no time flat. > It all works better when we all behave predictably. 

YESSSSSS Yes! Predictable is courteous! I get that. I'm a cyclist as much as I'm a motorist. 

But if I'm coming to major bike path like Burke trail, I'm gonna stop or at least slow down. There are too many people who just busts through the less trafficked stops there. I'm not gonna risk my morning by running over an impatient cyclists, just because I had the right of way. 

I think it would be better if cyclists got right of way by law in those cases. It's just more hassle to speed back up on bikes, and it gives incentives for cyclists to blow through them. I'm one of those people that sometimes gives up right of way to bicycles. And it's because I've gotten used to predicting when cyclists will break the rules of the road (it happens _a lot_).

Yeah, I'm not gonna go from 45 to 0 on a major road without a stop sign when I see a bike, because I know that cyclist isn't dumb enough to pull out in front of me.

But if I'm coming to a 4 way stop and there's a couple bikes coming down a hill to the same 4 way stop, you'd better believe I'm stopping and waiting for them to go through, because 99% of the time, those cyclists aren't. Often enough they aren't paying attention to another lane of traffic that is still moving and will likely kill me if I tried to cross it.  I just look at them and shake my head no, which is usually enough to get them moving again. I agree. Also don't take my right if way while I'm biking--that's only happened to me once in Seattle. This morning. A guy in a truck was stopped and trying to turn. He looked at me biking toward him then moved his truck into the bike path (ship canal trail) and paused there so he could make his turn. I had to lock up my brakes, and if it had been wetter out I would have t-boned him with my brand new bike. (I did not have a stop or yield sign.) Motorists also have less visibility than cyclists. People are just trying to virtue signal with their "no, you go" crap. Or when I'm standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross the road! If no one else is around, just keep going! If there are other cars, DEFINITELY keep going! 

You're not saving me any time because I still have to wait for you to come to a complete stop, realize you're being an asshat to other drivers, determine that the other lane of traffic is also safe, and then go. All of that takes just as long as it would for me to watch you whiz by and cross the street normally, you're only inconveniencing yourself! 

I had a bus - A BUS - once stop for me at an intersection with no stop sign and tons of other cars passing the bus. I stood there, refusing to commit suicide, and the bus driver continued to gesture. I pointed to the other cars, and he said through his open window "they're not going to see you if you don't step out". Yes, they're also not going to hit me if I don't step out INTO TRAFFIC.  Get off the bike and stop being the blight on traffic flow that you are, please. You, doofus cyclist, are often obnoxiously dangerous in your entitled right-of-way peddling at 20mph on a 40mph roadway with a long line of cars stacking up behind you. The last thing I want is an injured person but damn if some of you make that difficult.

Edit: I responded in the same tone as the OP. I even used his word 'doofus' to hint at this. The OP was generalizing motorists, so, fair is fair. > Driving in Seattle is merely a way for people to demonstrate who was raised better. Like... just GO. You're making traffic worse for everyone behind you just so you can make it better for one person who has to figure out what you're doing, rather than doing the predictable thing.

It's potentially worse than that too. If someone without a stop sign tries to unpredictably yield to me, there's no way in hell I'm going. I could start to go only to have you intentionally ram my car and _I_ would be at fault. Fuck that! Aurora from the Fremont bridge north to around 115th St allows using the bus/right-turn lane as a regular lane between 9am and 3pm weekdays. There’s clearly worded signs on every block, both ways. But every day at 9:30 I see dozens of cars stalled and not even making lights while the curb lane is wide open for blocks. Google maps drive time estimate shrinks by 5 minutes every time I use the lane. I am 100% with you on this. The moment you stop caring, you are free.  You wanna come into my lane at the last minute with no signal? Sure, come on in! Someone blocking the intersection? Guess I'll be here a few moments longer. I am only bothered when someone does something truly life threatening.  I used to have intense rage when I started driving. Everyone else was dumb. But I was probably the only one that was angry. Then for a few years I listened to Warm 106.9 FM, Love Songs with Dahlila. I was a twenty-something male. Whatever, it cured my road rage. Everyone else still drives the same way, but I enjoy myself a lot more.

My dad used to make it a point to get from A to B with as few lane changes as possible. I used to change lanes all the time to get there faster. But now I generally stay in the far right lane, and I'll get there when I get there. I waste enough of my own time as it is that there is no benefit to getting somewhere a few minutes sooner. This is the worst in Canada! If you even glance toward the street in Victoria, they will stop for you. There's nothing more frustrating when i'm out walking to have drivers constantly stopping and waving me into traffic.
I've taken to making eye contact with them and turning around and facing the other way until they move on,
Wtf. You dont have to wait for me to cross the f'ing road in front of you i'd rather you left and i can cross when there's NO traffic instead.
These people never actually go for a walk presumably. There is another option you didn't mention: the following car leaves enough room so that if the car in front stops suddenly, there's not a near miss.

He or she left enough room, yes. The margin seemed slim enough that he or she felt the need to call out the car in front for suprising him and almost causing an accident. [deleted] > NW Relevant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyz6mkvlEgA The inverse of this is also true.  If you see I have had my blinker on for more than a few seconds and start speeding to block me from my exit when there is plenty of clear space in front of you, expect a finger or two to fly up. When I first moved to Seattle and I would try to merge in traffic, I would turn on my blinker and without fail the guy behind me in the lane I want to merge into would speed up to block me. 
Out of nessessity my turn signal is no longer "I'd like to come over please! If you could slow down a bit and make some room, that would be great!"  
It has become "I'm coming through, bitches! Bllllaaaauuugggghhhhhhhhhh!!!" Maybe the car passed on the shoulder because u and the other driver were holding up traffic. Not saying its ok, but this is why we need to be predictable. As someone who moved here I can confirm:

Seattleites are Introverted Cats it’s the fluoride. Not saying this applies to your situation but a lot of people in our area seem to be unaware that all intersections are unmarked crosswalks unless there are signs prohibiting crossing(more or less, IANAL). Letting someone cross in the middle of the road is dumb for sure but doing it at an intersection without crosswalk lines might still be the right thing to do. http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/pedestrian_masterplan/pedestrian_toolbox/tools_deua_crosswalks.htm Every street corner is an unmarked crosswalk in Seattle. You're confusing people by standing on the corner. "You're in the middle of the fucking street! Just go!" Every. Day. When there is one car left, nobody behind them forever, and they stop for me to cross. Why I’m so happy to hear this from someone else! I tell everyone that I’ll take LA traffic over here any day and people look at me like I’m crazy... “We’re just nicer here.” Uh, that’s one word for it. Agreed, but posting stuff like this as much as possible gets more exposure than not posting it Technically Lynnwood, but figure the this sub is close enough. Would rather not give more info than that as it's a daily commute and would rather not deal with internet people in real life. I'm from Michigan where rules are more... suggestions... driving in Seattle is a riot.  The best is when it rains more than a drizel and everyone drives like they are in an ice storm. As a rider I'd rather take a ticket and not stop, had too many close-calls from behind. That said, almost everyone waves motorcyclists through and more often than not I'm on the receiving end and either I accept the invitation and cause a wreck or decline the invitation and cause traffic backups. Now I instinctively try not to even get in that situation, like sit there with crossed arms. "As for traffic flows, the data suggests that while the speeds are lower and the travel time may not be shorter, traffic continues to move and is predictable,” she wrote. “In other words, the travel conditions are more reliable, which has its own set of benefits."

So the zipper merge makes people move slower, and doesn't save us time, but we should do it anyway? And get all the way into the turn lanes. Quit leaving the ass end of your car hanging out and blocking both lanes. Why do people wait half way up the turn lane before entering it? Get in the turn lane and get out of the way. Yes, for the love of all that is holy USE YOUR BLINKER! So many awkward pedestrian incidents could be avoided this way. 

Me: Why the hell are you just waiting at the stop sign? I’m crossing to your right. Oh, great now you’re going to edge closer and closer to me and my dogs because apparently you wanted to turn. If you’d had your blinker on, I would have gladly waited. yeah and cyclists wear a helmet and put on lights at night. [deleted] Yes you idiots! The law in Washington State is: **Drive Right** **Pass** **Left**
https://youtu.be/4oqfodY2Lz0
 Thank you!  it's even worse when I'm not even waiting to cross - I used to wait in front of my apartment building for my vanpool, and at least a couple of times a week someone would slam on their brakes and try to wave me across.  I got to where I would just either look away, or stare questioningly at them while not moving. it's even worse when they stop to pretend like they're nice, but then speed off like you crossing the street was the worst thing to happen to them today Every uncontrolled intersection is an unmarked crosswalk in Seattle. So, assuming the pedestrian isn't crossing in the middle of a block, those "idiot" drivers are following the rules, and you are making up your own. About 20 years ago I drove a dump truck loaded full down the streets of Seattle. Jaywalkers pissed me off because even going as slow as I reasonably could the hills are such in Seattle that the Jaywalkers wouldn't notice you when they were crossing on the red lights. I expected people to be suicidal but it was really hard to not hit people who didn't obey the light. I could be wrong since it's been a while since I took the test (so help me out if I am wrong), but iirc the pedestrian always has the right of way even if they're crossing illegally.  

And regardless who is correct, I am always going to default to the side of extra caution when it's possible I could hit a pedestrian with my car.  It creates a shitty situation for everyone and the guy in the car is probably going to get sued.  

 Sounds like OP stopped in time to avoid an accident, so they weren't following too close. Most likely took 2-3 seconds, but I know my butt clinching broke other laws of physics during that time. 45 mph ≈ 72 km/h

Actually the Pittsburgh Left is when a car is trying to turn left in front of a long line of cars coming the other way. It actually makes a lot of sense as the car trying to turn left is blocking traffic for the line of cars behind them. By letting someone turn in front of you by slowing down slightly, you're allowing traffic to move more freely.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_left Cars must yield to pedestrians in all intersections. In Washington State, all intersections are crosswalks, whether marked or not. Cars are required to yield to pedestrians at the curb waiting to cross or already in intersections. So you are wrong to complain about cars stopping.  In some states (MN, for example), the law requires that cars stop when a pedestrian is waiting at a corner even without a painted crosswalk. There is an implied crosswalk at every road intersection. I don't know what the law is here in WA.  I just wish more Seattle drivers would stop where there is a painted crosswalk... it's about a 50/50 proposition in my experience.

EDIT: Found the relevant law: http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.235.  You're required to stop for a pedestrian at an unmarked crosswalk.   Cars are supposed to stop when there are pedestrians at legal marked and unmarked crosswalks here. If you don't like it, move somewhere else.  You're not supposed to stop in the middle of the street for a pedestrian either, especially a 45mph road. Randomly stopping on a road that has no stop sign is dangerous to everyone, including those you're trying to let out. What happens when you do get rear ended and the person you're letting out gets rammed because you get complete ran into and pushed into them? Pedestrians should cross where it's safe.  No, if you almost fucking read end someone but don't, YOU'RE DRIVING SAFELY.

Seriously, someone came to a fucking abrupt halt from 45mph unexpectedly and the driver behind didn't hit him and you're whining that he's driving too close. You're absolutely wrong.  Wasn't an intersection and and I was following at a safe distance, hence the "almost" part of the accident. If I was at an unsafe distance, I probably wouldn't have posted because I would be getting my vehicle towed.  It's actually the opposite of courteous/cautious There's gotta be a happy medium because 90% of the zip ahead cars overrun the end of the merge. Apparently what's SUPPOSED to happen is something called zipper merging. But theres no way in hell people would agree to acually start practicing it. The born and bred Seattle drivers are the best.  It's all of the people from other cities, bringing their driving styles into ours, that fucks up the works.   Its probably law SOMEWHERE. idk if its here though. I honestly drive with them on 100% of the time rain or shine or moon. It makes it easier to see you (even in full sun it makes you stand out) and for some reason at least to me it makes it easier to predict how fast someone is coming. The only times I've nearly gotten into accidents with bikers are when I acted like they were going to follow the rules.

So, sorry. I'm going to wait until I'm DAMN sure you're going to actually stop at the stop sign before I go. It's messed up that I actually carried some of the fault when a rider slammed into my rear passenger door. The only time I've been in a collision with a bike was because I expected them to act predictably. They ran into my rear panel after blowing through the stop sign.

So I'm going to be damn sure you're going to stop before I go. I'm still salty about that whole process. Very true, except this wasn't a government bus. It looked like one of those private primery gray short buses. Also, if the bus is stopped at a stop sign waiting to pull into cross traffic, and you are the cross traffic and don't have a stop, you still have the right-of-way. The yield is to protect off-boarding passengers. This. RCW has a law to yield to a bus pulling back into traffic. Rarely does anyone do this due to either not knowing the law like the OP or refusing to follow it. That’s why It’s so shocking to people when someone actually does it.  You have zero evidence for this claim. I wasn't tailgating. I didn't hit the guy. And when you have to decrease speed from anything faster than 20 mph to zero as fast as you can with no notice, you'll almost have an accident as well. 💩 It wasn't a KC bus. It was also fully stopped, like I had said in the original post. You've never been to Portland. Written like a true passive-aggressive Seattleite. Well done! I feel like you're working through some other issues here. I don't think you read what he wrote.  Wow, some assumptions made by you. This was in Lynnwood. But hey, keep projecting that anger! Cool thanks.  Going to come to a dead stop on I-5 to tie my shoelaces. You might actually be legally retarded.  [deleted] If the bus is at a stop sign you don't yield to them Someone seems pretty clueless about what a "Stop" sign means. Yeah, you. Public Service Announcement:  In Belltown, the on ramp going northbound to State Route 99 entering the Battery Street Tunnel from Bell St is a yield sign - not a stop sign.  Lord have mercy.  What of when the next lane over you're merging onto is already loaded with a line of cars idling forward bumper to bumper from the time you can merge to when the onramp is exit only and exiting? This is my daily experience leaving the U-district to go north. The problem place I've seen lately is I-405N with people getting on from 520W.  There's about a mile of lane, but too many people just stop immediately after the start of the lane.  Why not keep driving until you can merge?  Why just stop? Its because of the assholes who run all the way to the end of the merging lane then park and wait for someone to let them in.  I lanr split sometimes but only when traffic is really sliw and people are clearly abusing the merge lane.  As someone who moved here from new york, I don't think anyone anywhere knows how to zipper merge.

Although driving in pennsylvania one time where there was construction which took a 2 lane highway down to 1 lane, they had actually set up a sign a few miles back saying "Use both lanes".  Was nice to see. Where is the fictional location where people DO know how to do this?  I have lived in several cities and driven all over the US and people do this wrong everywhere.  Most people are horrible drivers everywhere.  Most people will tell you that people in their cities are the worst drivers, no matter where they live. The problem is, people get overly anxious wondering if they'll get a spot to fit in, so they preemptively merge which dicks over the whole system. 
If they would just take a deep breath to control the anxiety, and trot along in confident unison, the zipper merge would be incredibly more effective. No one in the States does. I learned to do it (and to stop getting annoyed at people not knowing where they're going ahead of time) living overseas.  

If we're airing grievances though, as a native Seattleite I feel we need to talk about round-abouts.  In fact most Americans do.  

In a two lane approach: Use the interior lane to go straight or left unless otherwise marked, the right lane to turn right or go straight.  Slow down, yield to your left.  *Indicate the direction you intend to go on approach (like you would at a stop sign).*  Use your (right) blinker if able to indicate when exiting the round-about.  It's not hard guys.  If I can do it driving on the left, you can learn it here. For some reason Alki people think a southbound unprotected left turn to the West Seattle bridge should be zippered. I've witnessed so many near accidents by people coming from the beach and forcing their way in when they clearly should yield until it's clear to turn.  https://goo.gl/maps/GKZ3PohJDou It would help if people followed the correct law, which was to match the speed of traffic. Most of the time the lane splitters are irritated at people either flying down the merge lane and getting over at the last minute or the more egregious getting over into the merge lane then flying past and coming back in further down. [deleted] People in Seattle know how to, they just don't let anyone. There are often people who decide they're going to play hero vigilante and block one of the lanes by straddling the line because they think that people using the empty lane are cutting or cheating somehow.  People who do this are the ones actually breaking the law by impeding traffic. 

Using all available space is the preferred way to do it.  That's why they set up the cones where they did.  If they wanted you to merge earlier, they would put the cones earlier.

Citation directly from WSDOT:

http://kuow.org/post/dont-be-shy-drivers-wsdot-says-zipper-merge-way-go It actually is the law:

"Sec. 1. RCW 28A.220.050 and 1986 c 93 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:The superintendent of public instruction shall include information on (1) the proper use of the left-hand lane on multilane highways and (2) the late merge zipper method to be applied when two lanes are merging, which consists of drivers using both lanes of traffic until reaching the defined merge area and then alternating in "zipper" fashion into the single lane, in instructional material used in traffic safety education courses to ensure that new operators of motor vehicles are instructed on these driving skills."

http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2055.pdf It's only zipper merging if there's a merge point. If both lanes continue but one just turns into an exit, then zipper merging doesn't apply.  Thank you Then you are breaking the law.  It's not cutting the line. It's using all the available roadway.  Not only is it okay, it's also much more efficient for everyone using the highway.  If God didn't want me to use the lane, then He wouldn't have paved it. Glad we could help. http://kuow.org/post/how-merge-traffic-seattle-youre-not-going A marked bike lane will have the solid white line turn into a dashed white line near an intersection.  Cars wishing to turn right can legally enter the bike lane in that dashed line area.  Of course they need to do so safely: they need to signal and give space to bikes in the lane just as they would for any lane change.  

What I do is put on my signal and wait if I think I can't complete the turn without causing a bike to brake.  Otherwise, I signal and *actively enter the bike lane* (to prevent a cyclist from sneaking past unexpectedly on my right if it turns out that I can't complete the turn for some reason) then complete the turn normally.  
 A skilled cyclist will not be in a bike lane to the right of a right-turning motor vehicle. Using your turn signal helps me know where to position myself in the lane, so I am safe and you can make your turn.

Sadly, many cyclists have absorbed the message that you stay to the right, no matter what, and danger themselves and slow motor vehicle traffic. When they do this, yes, sadly, you must wait. They are the vulnerable road user. You are the one who can kill them. I wonder this too and am happy we are getting protected, signaled, bike lanes in the heavy traffic downtown area.  It sure is growing pains on how to use them but they are designed so the signals separate the bikes and vehicles so there is no guess work.  Other areas, I will wait if no car is behind me, but will make them slow down if there are cars behind me. I pick the least amount of people being inconvenienced at the time regardless of mode of transportation.  I just I go with a general blanket equality based on quantity. What's this? A motorist *on Reddit* actually *asking* how to behave around cyclists? Without generalizing and berating anyone?
My hat goes off to you, good sir! The onus is on the driver not to turn right into a cyclist _who is already there_, but the onus is on the cyclist not to try to pass a moving vehicle on the right, especially if it's already signalling to turn right.

Obviously it's a bit of a nuanced situation, since the lanes are ostensibly separate up until the intersection. I see cyclists ride to the front of the line all the time, which I'm not sure is legal or not (maybe it only is if the cars are stopped?). When I'm on my bike I'll carefully ride to the front if the light is red, but the moment it turns green I'll keep my position and won't pass any cars (especially with a blinker on!).

This happened to a friend of mine a few years back. He was at a red light waiting to turn right, and when he went on the green, a cyclist tried to pass on the right and collided with his passenger door. The biker was held at-fault for the incident, which my friend said was extremely satisfying as he was a major douche screaming about right-of-way the whole time. Seriously, how can a driver be held responsible for something approaching from _behind_? You should be as far to the right as possible before you execute a right turn. If you did that, there would be no problem for the cyclist. you signal ahead of time (be obvious), slow down in a reasonable way without blocking the bike, and when you're ready to turn, use your judgement about whether he's going to be impeded and maybe wait a few You aborted their niceness competition! It’s state law that vehicles stop for all pedestrians at uncontrolled intersections. I understand not wanting to start crossing if other vehicles haven’t stopped, but the bus driver is merely following the law. 

> Vehicles shall stop at intersections to allow pedestrians and bicycles to cross the road within a marked or unmarked crosswalk (RCW 46.61.235).  Get out of your car, and stop being a threat to others peaceably getting around town. Take a deep breath. Loosen your white knuckle grip on the steering wheel. Try switching to decaf. You'll get there eventually even if you have to yield to a bicycle now and again. I've been a cyclist and motorist, and I've never been stuck behind cyclists for long. At most it's a minute or two before I can pass them on safe stretch of the road. It's far smaller hassle than some people make it to be. It's not entitlement, it's the law That's awfully presumptuous to think you know the manner in which the parent poster rides their bicycle. Maybe try to be less quick to judge people based on preconceived notions, it will make you more likeable and you'll have better (or some) sex.  20 mph ≈ 32 km/h  
40 mph ≈ 64 km/h

Everyone drives in the middle and left lanes and just ignores the right lane to the point where it almost defeats the purpose of opening up that lane in the first place. A little technology could go a long way here. An electronic sign that says when it is, and is not, open to all traffic would be helpful.

I take Aurora all the time, but usually during commute hours, so I'm just not in the habit of using the curb lane. Oh god. Seattle drivers. I use that lane when I need to but its dangerous because most other drivers dont understand that its okay to use. The only times I've felt road rage have been the times I've felt unjustly honked at. Oh Dahlila : ) To your second point, I think car accidents are extra tragic when someone dies speeding to work! ;)  Have you ever driven in Seattle? Nice assuming I wasn't following the rules of the road when the guy in front of me obviously wasn't. There was no legal reason for him to come to a complete and sudden stop. This wasn't even a gentle slow down on his part. It was him stopping as fast as he could, so that a bus at a stop sign could pull out and turn left. That shit would frustrate and startle anyone. On most seattle roads it's almost impossible to leave enough room for a completely unexpected (IE, you can see in front of the car and they have no reason to stop) slam on the brakes without getting at least reasonably close to the car in front of you when you react.

Here's why:
If I leave enough room for a worst case scenario out-of-the-blue-brake-slamming to not end up close to that car, someone will certainly end up in front of me in the 1/8th mile of space I just left, and therefore I don't have enough room if that new car decides to do an out-of-the-blue-brake-slamming, unless of course I go WAY under the speed limit to regain that insane amount of space. You're an idiot. I'm the OP, I know the situation. You weren't there. You're speculating. You're an idiot. I've noticed that it takes dumb people at least twice, or in this case quadruple, the number of words to phrase something than it would take a reasonable person. And then they more often than not sign off with a slur about how everybody else are the dumb ones. >[**Ballard Driving Academy [2:46]**](http://youtu.be/nyz6mkvlEgA)

[^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) UFF DA! 🇳🇴 The upside to this is once the person speeds up to block you it usually leaves a giant open space behind them. Not always though - one time when I was taking 520W to 405N I had not one, not two, but three people speed up to try and block me, even though I started signaling right when the carpool lane ended and it was legal to move over. That's not a Seattle thing.  Or it wasn't until recently.  The opposite actually. When I first moved here I was like, "wait, you put on your blinker and they let you in?"  

Contrast that to Denver or Atlanta or Miami or L.A. where everyone speeds up.  

So you might want to thank all your new neighbors for that one.   That is obvious.  The reason I brought it up is that had I done what the so-called 'polite' driver was doing by giving up their right of way, that car would have slammed into me. leave if you don't like it
 You're totally right - see my edit. Except the law is to yield so the right of way isn't taken away from the driver until he steps into the roadway; even then, it's still jaywalking when a "reasonable person" would consider it dangerous to enter the roadway. 

Many people don't know the pedestrian laws here and it causes so many accidents. 

It mostly because of the inept drivers that OP is talking about though.  I think it's all of WA. I grew up in Spokane and the cops would stage little ticket parties with someone waiting at an unmarked intersection and ticketing cars that didn't stop. Holy shit, you're right. Four years of living here and you're the first person to point that out. Now I have to edit my post. Yeah the ride share customers are the worst. "I'll just wait for my Uber on the corner and act like I'm crossing the road" every corner isn’t an unmarked crosswalk, IIRC. Only specific kinds of intersections.  Still wonder how we got anything done, or even survived, when humans were driving.     [Yeah?](https://youtu.be/WAA-IXRY5cQ) totally, just was trying to figure out anywhere in seattle that had that situation and couldn't think of any. you're nicer than me. i deploy the finger [deleted] Sounds like the law could use an update then. Either allow them to cross or make it illegal to do so, but not both. An "uncontrolled intersection"? What is that, an intersection that escaped from the zoo? > Almost got into an accident this morning because someone decided to come to a complete stop on a street

That's true, but it sounded to me like the margin was thin. They felt disturbed enough to go online and comment about how the other car stopped for an illegitiate reason. This is exactly what this post is about. You are giving the right of way to someone that should not have the right of way. Just because it "makes a lot of sense" does not mean it's a law and should be followed. There are intersections that have a left turn light, if an intersection doesn't then the left turn must yield. It is not other motorists obligation to keep the flow of traffic in an opposing lane. It IS the motorists obligation to act as predictably and safely as possible. When you have certain people following this ideology and others following something else, that is not predictable and not safe which is exactly why we have laws to follow in the first place.  Can you cite "at the curb waiting to cross" because  /u/foxhollow 's citiation makes it sound like you have to be "upon" the roadway .

>RCW 46.61.235  Crosswalks.

>(1) The operator of an approaching vehicle shall stop and remain stopped to allow a pedestrian or bicycle to cross the roadway **within an unmarked or marked crosswalk** when the **pedestrian or bicycle is upon or within one lane of the half of the roadway** upon which the vehicle is traveling or onto which it is turning. For purposes of this section "half of the roadway" means all traffic lanes carrying traffic in one direction of travel, and includes the entire width of a one-way roadway. How does this law apply to a situation I saw downtown the other day:

Through traffic was backed up and the cars didn’t enter the intersection so as not to block it. They have a green light. Middle lane opens up and van pulls out just as someone jaywalks into the middle lane. The van could not have seen this pedestrian and had the right of way. It was a very close call and what shocked me was that the jaywalker had the balls to punch the van’s back window as it passed. no you aren't. [link](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.240)

> (1) Every pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway.

also, [46.61.235](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.235)

> (2) No pedestrian or bicycle shall suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk, run, or otherwise move into the path of a vehicle which is so close that it is impossible for the driver to stop.
 Speaking as a frequent pedestrian: if you're the ONLY car around...just go.  You're not doing anyone any favors.  It takes half a second to proceed through the intersection and we'll be out of each others' lives.  Compare that to the five or ten seconds you're sitting there wasting time while I cross.  You're not helping, you're just trying to perpetuate this false "we're so nice in Seattle" narrative. As a pedestrian, I get angry when a driver violates traffic laws on order to be polite. When they stop when they have the right of way they're actually making it more dangerous for me to be in the street- suddenly we're in a situation where nobody knows the rules and therefore didn't know what to expect. I'm not so much worried about the driver in question but other drivers/bikers. Plus you're impeding the flow of traffic which is just going to make traffic worse for everybody. And finally, all of this has to be negotiated by waving of hands, at a distance, through a windshield that likely has glare on it. 

No thank you. You're being more polite by just following the expected behavior if following the rules. [Any intersection is a potential legal crosswalk](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/lets-get-something-straight-pedestrians-always-have-the-right-of-way-at-intersections/). I agree pedestrians need to be aware of traffic before crossing and cars shouldn't slam on the brakes suddenly, but if they do stop to let a pedestrian cross at an intersection they are following the law You do know that basically every intersection is a legal place to cross, right? Even on 45 mph roads.  Right, next time someone jaywalks in front of me I'll just mow them down instead of stopping.

STOP TAILGAITING! > You're not supposed to stop in the middle of the street for a pedestrian either, especially a 45mph road.

Wait, what? You are supposed to hit them? What kind of person thinks: "Gee, that pedestrian walked out into the street but if I stop the guy tailgating it might dent my bumper so I'll just plow right through the pedestrian. Serves him or her right for walking out onto the street and endangering the paint on my bumper!" Lol. Every tailgating Beamer driver in Bellevue just nodded their head in agreement to this statement.  People don't zipper merge. So, now being empowered with data, don't wait in line and curse at the people making an effort. That was my whole point in sharing that article. An attitude of resistance to being a "zip ahead car" is exactly what slows the traffic down further. 

Edit: shared the article in a separate comment thread. It's this one: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/why-last-second-lane-mergers-are-good-for-traffic.html Complete BS.  Biker's fault.  If this is what's causing the problem there needs to be more separation between bikes and cars. That cyclist is an idiot that deserves to get injured, and I'm sorry it had to be your car the drove the point home. 

Its a chicken and egg issue with bad cyclists: if they know drivers are going to err on the side of waiting/stopping, they're either going to take advantage of that and blow through signs, or, in frustration with the drivers not going, blow through signs rather than wait and take their turn.  >if the bus is stopped at a stop sign waiting to pull into cross traffic, and you are the cross traffic and don't have a stop, 

Yes, you do have to stop.  The law is there so buses can get back into traffic safely without having to wait for cross traffic to let them in. We do have some to the contrary, however.

Since there wasn't an accident, OP obviously left enough room to stop. It isn't just KC buses; this applies to every bus that operates in the city. 

I thought you said that the bus was trying to pull out, which implied to me that it was moving. My bad, I didn't know the situation. 

Regardless, it's good to know that those Yield signs are there, and they are the real deal.  What's passive about it?  Fuck off if you don't like it here.  Move. Haha you're totally right. I went on a pedestrian rant for some reason. My b!  Wow, super terrible of me to assume you were in Seattle because you posted in the Seattle sub.  5 mph ≈ 8 km/h

Not sure why everyone decided that "someone" was referring to the subby. That onramp is horrifying That may be the scariest spot in the city. That is a pretty bad on ramp if traffic is heavy, but I completely agree. A yield sign does not prohibit stopping when necessary and trust me, at that on-ramp it is very difficult to know that it's ok to merge without stopping.

 I find that using your horn for several seconds is a good reminder to people for next time. Speed match. If the highway is only going 10 MPH at the point of the merge (end of the merging lane) then you should be going 10 MPH at the merge point and zipper in. If traffic is going 60 MPH then you need to go 60 MPH to zipper in. If you can't merge in you are going too fast or too slow for merging. If traffic is stopped then you pull to the merge point, again the end of the merging lane, and move in when traffic moves up. Each car behind you should do the same *at the merge point*. Only one car should be merging over at a time. Driving to the end of the merging lane is the most efficient way of merging in. Watch how a zipper works and that's exactly how you should be merging onto the highway. It doesn't zip lock at a point *before* the zipper pull it happens *at* the zipper pull like the ending of the merge lane. If you can't merge into the traffic to the left of you then you are going too fast or too slow. You need to be speed matching when you get on. That means not going faster *or* slower than the traffic you are trying to merge into. You're actually the one being the asshole not letting people use the entirety of the merging lane. This is proven to be much more efficient and it's not an abuse. We're not racing so you shouldn't be upset with a car getting in front of you. If you merge correctly it would have no effect on your commute time. What you are doing is dangerous and illegal, and goes against the advice of WSDOT.  You are making traffic worse with your misguided vigilantism! 

> It might seem selfish, but the best way to ease congestion, according to Washington State Department of Transportation's Travis Phelps, is to drive right up to the closure before merging over.

>"There can be the weird idea that goes through people's head that, 'Those people are cheating, they're cutting in line.' Well, it actually helps traffic flow if you can let folks in. Play nice with the other person, let them in. Treat traffic like a team sport," Phelps said, speaking with KUOW's Bill Radke.

 Those signs are great, they actually installed a few permanent ones in Colorado and occasionally set up temporary ones for construction zones. [Unfortunately the majority of people still don't heed their instructions, this was captured on my dashcam a few months ago](https://youtu.be/TuIPPoz8CHw). Nobody is from Seattle. There were only about 250 people living here in the early 90s. TBH, everyone of them is a terrible driver. Can confirm. Moved from a college town in Kansas (also have driven in Kansas City). Both of those nobody knows how to properly drive (zip, merge, etc).

I try to get over early because most Kansans can be assholes and refuse to let anybody get into their lane when it's time to merge. You're _literally_ spending the entire half-mile of warning trying to get over early, even then still having to stop. Can confirm. Source: Houstonian  Minnesota.  I'm not from there, but they're very VERY proud of their zipper merging. Well, as someone who went to the Puyallup (WA State as it's now called) Fair twice this month, everyone zipper merged both times I arrived left, both in crowded parking lots and getting onto the side streets.  *shrug* 

Maybe it's a suburban thing. Boston!  If you're a native Seattleite,  curious where else you've lived in the states where it was just as bad? I've never been anywhere in North America where the population is so consistent and coordinated at leaving lanes empty for no reason. They can only fly down the merge lane when everyone gets over too early though.  When people know how to zipper merge, that is never an issue. There are two halves to a zipper. Part of "nobody knows how to zipper merge" is that the cars in the target lane need to make room, but don't. It's a tango, 1 at a time from each lane. What happens though is that the target lane is full of cars that stupidly merged too far back, and then they see all the merging cars as aggressors and don't let them in. It's a cyclical problem. It doesn't work because nobody tries it, and nobody tries it because it doesn't work.

Except it works everywhere else because a majority of people know how to do it. Position yourself in front of the car behind you and merge at speed, like a zipper. The problem here is no one on the highway seems to leave room for the merging vehicles.  Everyday on my commute we all know that there will be vehicles trying to merge at the 99 stadium on ramp and yet every single car is bumper to bumper.  Leave some space if you know a merge is coming up! Make one. [deleted] [deleted] Thanks.  I'm going to continue to pass them in on the median and think they are assholes then.   So what you're saying is that instead of queuing [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/I-90,+Bellevue,+WA+98005/@47.5800688,-122.1583763,3a,75y,286.28h,81.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqAkg1OAWx0YBzNYod9IHUw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x54906c02181a3dbf:0xa48968f38bba821a!8m2!3d47.5802902!4d-122.164581) like everyone is (turning toward Everett), I should use the second lane from the right all the way on to the ramp (where there is a dashed line that allows movement into the rightmost lane)? I'm not arguing, I'm genuinely curious. What about [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.6032745,-122.3265285,3a,75y,314.28h,78.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sYdpiEOhWN3YxWTt0fKIUrg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)? Where people cruise past people that have been waiting in the left lane to get on the express lanes going north on I-5 while cruising down the exit only lane for seneca street? People will literally block traffic for the exit lane waiting for someone to let them in or will just bully their way in right at the exit. Grinds my gears!  yeah, thats awesome! Makes sense, sounds like waiting is what DOL also recommends.

If I could request something to cyclists it would be don't ride RIGHT next to the white solid line. 

> Three feet from the widest point of both vehicles 
is the minimum safe passing distance at slow speeds. Even if the bicyclist is riding on the edge of the bicycle lane next to the traffic lane the 3 feet rule applies.  In Capital Hill they used to have a section of parking right next to one of those guarded bike lines. When you wanted to turn right you had to cross a parking spot and the bike line, so it was crazy hard to see the biker. I swear I nearly killed someone a few times. The last time I made that turn, I saw that they removed the parking spot. If only more cyclists were so skilled though. It seems like many don't realize they have the right to take a full lane. It's so much better when a cyclists does change lanes out of the bike lane in that situation, but it would be dangerous for drivers to assume a cyclists will. 

So many cyclists leave themselves in a bad situation by staying in the bike lane or put themselves in a worse situation where they're straddling the lanes, just take the full lane, don't ride between lanes, that's way more dangerous. It sends a clear message to the motorist that you are in front of them when you are in their lane, and they should make a proper lane change pass at that point to pass. Straddling leaves it open for interpretation and usually sucks for both parties. It shouldn't be possible to pass a vehicle on the right that is about to turn right. You should already be as far right as possible, in order to prevent this exact scenario. If there's a full bike lane cyclists can ride to the front of the line, if not it's technically unlawful. Without the lane it'd be like a car getting onto a shoulder and passing everyone that's stopped (obviously illegal). It's just that on a bike you likely don't need to move off the road, but you're not in a separate lane, so you're violating (b) below.

> **RCW 46.61.115**

> **When overtaking on the right is permitted.**

>(1) The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of another vehicle only under the following conditions:

>(a) When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;

>(b) Upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled by the overtaking vehicle.

>(2) The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right only under conditions permitting such movement in safety. Such movement shall not be made by driving off the roadway.
 But like who is going to get within less than 2' of a parked car? A cyclists can still squeeze past you, and some will certainly try, especially if you have to yield for a pedestrian. Ok, I didn't know it was a law. It's an obnoxious law, but fine. But I'm still not gonna step out into active traffic because a bus driver thinks I should. There's the law, and then there's common sense.  On the road system built for cars?

K Sometimes the law is wrong when it comes to common sense and safety.  :) That's awfully presumptuous to think you know the manner in which the commenter   drives their car. Maybe try to be less quick to judge people based on preconceived notions, it will make you more likeable. Every day. I live here.  Yes, there are times when a new car enters the space you leave before you and before you adapt to the new circumstance you are following closer than you'd like. Yes, there is no way to prevent all rear-end collisions. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. [deleted] ^See exactly the characteristic warmth one expects from Seattleites. To be fair it's a pretty stupid and confusing rule. How about we just allow jaywalking when it's safe to do so, instead of the occasional entitled pedestrian stepping out in front of moving traffic? Or the opposite, which is what you described.  Well that seems stupid Can confirm. They taught me in driver's ed here that any intersection in WA without a traffic light should be treated as a crosswalk and it is required by law for cars to stop for any pedestrians waiting at corners. You're right, it's only at intersections, not any random corner.  Are you from the future...?  [deleted] Its an intersection without a light. You should know this based on your username. Brake checking is illegal for a reason. Unexpectedly stopping in the middle of normal flow is incredibly dangerous. I was at a safe distance. Someone unexpectedly slamming on the brakes at 45 mph and coming to a full stop as short as they can in front of you will almost cause two types of accidents, and neither one is because of following too close. Fair to debate the concept of the Pittsburgh Left and you make good points. But in your post you make it sound the the Pittsburgh Left is a similar situation to what was described in the OP. You relate "this" to the Pittsburgh Left which is not the case at all.  No, it doesn't. The same rules apply for a market crosswalk. The really applies to a street with 2 lanes with a divider or a multilane street. I'm driving down the road on a street with 2 lanes and a turn lane. You're in front of me crossing from the left side. If you have entered the turn lane at that crosswalk in front of me I have to stop. If you're still in the oncoming lane I don't. The UPON means that you're at the lane on my side of the street.

This rule is meant to not have drivers stopping unnecessarily, but to give enough safety buffer to pedestrians. "Upon or within" 

I interpret the "within" to extend to the sidewalk adjacent to the roadway.  That was definitely the intention of a similar law in MN (I recall the debate when it was enacted many years ago).   I don't understand your point. The text you quote talks about places OTHER THAN a marked or unmarked crosswalk. At a marked or unmarked crosswalk (that is, any road intersection), a pedestrian has the right of way and vehicles must yield. Exactly. The Principal of Least Annoyance says I'd rather wait that extra half second; instead, they gotta wait at least ten times as long and I feel like I'm supposed to skedaddle extra fast across the street because Mr OhSoNice slammed on his breaks for me.

When I find myself approaching that situation, I find a way to look busy ("Oh, look at this suddenly fascinating light pole that's just far enough from the crosswalk!") so the single car can avoid the crushing guilt they apparently get by making someone wait an extra breath or two. I agree. Also the energy required to stop and start a car is much more than for a person. So if there is an environmental concern, having cars stop and start for one person to cross the road has a bigger environmental impact.  Not completely true. Pedestrians have right of way at any intersection, but they are certainly not all legal. They are given right of way so angry motorists don't use the lack of right of way to just run them over when pedestrians cross the street illegally. Not completely true. Every intersection pedestrians have the right of way, but they are not all legal. This is so angry motorists don't use the lack of right of way to just run them over when pedestrians cross the street illegally. 45 mph ≈ 72 km/h

What's that? No? Then he wasn't fucking tailgating. Yeah seriously. This idiot is going to wreck someone so they can be right.  Yeah, i pay attention. I have however been rear ended 3 times in the past 3 years. I'm the one getting hit, piss off. GET READING COMPREHENSION Obviously if someone is already in the street you have to stop, we're talking about stopping to let someone go here.  As a pedestrian, if you step into the street, crosswalk or not, without allowing “reasonable” time for cars to  stop, you are at fault.  A tailgating driver would have had an accident in this case so your point really is flawed and not relevant. I only curse under my breath at the really stupid ones. No 20 mph faster then the speed limit is not what you should be doing right now. Nor is skipping 3 openings before running out of road. I watched a guy so desperate to skip the line of cars he had to smash on his breaks and STOP because he was going to hit a girder. Ran out of space, kept right on trucking on the literal side of the road until the girder appeared.  You are confused and thinking about buses stopping at *bus stops*. Also, this wasn't a government bus.

Edit: also please read the law you linked. It is specifically about buses traveling with traffic, and not about buses going into cross-traffic. Unless you're speaking about a different law. But not enough room to not leave a comment on how close he came to hitting him. This had no markings on it. The sun hadn't come up yet, but the bus looked like one of those primer gray short buses. Honestly I think this was a privately owned bus as I doubt a government bus driver would have made that turn. You still made a lot of assumptions even beyond which City.  I almost killed a guy on a motorcycle at that onramp.   Trust me, coming to a stop is often the safest way to approach.  

The bigger problem is people not accelerating once they finally do decide to commit.  You need to get up to the speed of traffic as quickly as possible. What I meant by idling by is from the merge point to the very end, cars are at a crawl with no space between, as you said, I'll have to match their speed and crawl along until some asshat let's me in, meanwhile.  What you're saying, in my situation, is wishful thinking, as in, I wish there was an opportunity to zipper in but rush hour says otherwise and otherwise, people could just be a little more patient and flexible. Oh i totally understand how it works. Im talking about the (majority) of instances where people fly all the eay up the side of traffic even though its moving decently well and then stop at the end becauee they were too focused on getting to the front to realize they should have been trying to merge. That doesnt help traffic at all.  How is it dangerous haha illegal yeah but dangerous? I love it. Not only are those idiots leaving miles of usable road empty, but you've even got the aggressive traffic justice warriors trying to block the people who are correctly filling the lane. It's annoying on the highway seeing a 1/4 mi of empty lane because people merge too early. But what really drives me nuts are the people doing it down town. It happens all the time with the construction: lanes are closed somewhere (like 6th these past few weeks) and people merge to the open lane 2-3 blocks early. As in, they'll sit stopped at a green light blocking traffic rather than moving into one of the empty lanes on the next block. If every block is full of cars, then you get the maximum throughput at the actual bottleneck where the lanes close. Instead what happens is the light turns green where the closure is, and the 4 cars waiting move through and no one else. Everyone else is patiently waiting in line stuck at the last fucking red light. If you had moved forward into the adjacent lanes you'd have gotten through! more cars through each green light = less cars on the road and less traffic. Keep it trill. I was in Minnesota this summer and witnessed a perfect zipper merge. No brake lights. It was a thing of beauty and brought tears to my eyes. Central PA is horrible at this. Even if there's no construction people just coast in the left lane leaving the right one open. Exactly. If the merge happened at the correct spot, the merge lane isn't empty for anyone to fly down.

It's the same kind of idea as "if I can pass you on the right, you're in the wrong lane"

Yeah there are exceptions, but most of this time it holds true in both cases. It's an issue when people pretend exit lanes on the freeway are meant for zipper merging. Stop all exiting traffic behind them. 

For those wondering the merge from exit only lanes should be happening while there's a dashed line. If you're getting out of the exit lane when it's solid white it means you're waiting too long. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Because it's not actually a law to have to zipper merge. I don't know what the alternative would be to zipper merging -
except being an asshole - which is illegal as stated in the article I linked.  

I grew up here, zipper merging is how they taught me in driving school. WSDOT clarifies this further by saying to drive up as far as you can before merging to use all available space.

There aren't RCW's for things that are just the correct way to do something. Is it legal to go 30 miles an hour under the speed limit with no one in front of you on any other road?  Or to drive down the middle of the line between two lanes? I honk at them. The good old hold the horn until they're out of your way honk... I'm basically a grumpy old man already though, and technically honking like that might be unlawful. Whoa TIL if I rotate my phone it changes the direction in street view. That's not a zipper merge so what the hell are you talking about in a thread about zipper merges? People who go to the end of a divulging lane to cross over a median are in the wrong. It has nothing to do with using available roadway in a zipper merge.  I'm a daily bike commuter, and I will ride at the far left edge of the bike lane if doing otherwise means that I'm likely to get doored by a parked car.  I'll also ride pretty close to the center of the lane on a road with sharrows because if I don't some motorists are tempted to pass much too close to avoid entering a lane with oncoming traffic (even if they could do so safely).

I'll admit that there are a lot of stupid, annoying cyclists (just like there are many stupid, annoying drivers).  But usually we're doing whatever it is we're doing because it's far safer than the alternative.  Recall that we are quite vulnerable and are surrounded by deadly machines. I'd also like to point out that your waiting to safely pass a cyclist (in the bike lane or not) is not the end of the world. Just like the other comment here, I ride as far left as I can. People getting into and out of their cars look for cyclists even less than motorists on the road. I'm going to ride as far left as I think the door opens. Even wider if I see lights on or people inside the vehicle.  Aside from controlled intersections with bike lines (like you might see downtown), does a road's bike lane persist when it comes up to a 4-way stop? How can it while still allowing cars to turn right? On the road system built for both cars and bikes. Where did I imply that they even drive a car? Then you should know that leaving as much space as you think is needed is all but impossible. People will be constantly merging in front of you or going around you, or any other number of things that will reduce the room in front of you.

To expect to have that much room for more than half the time you are driving in traffic isn't feasible unless you constantly drive 5mph less than the rest of the traffic. I've got to know, what's it like going through life as someone who thinks they know everything, demonstrates they know nothing, and when told they're wrong just doubles down on their mistake? Do you go to auto shops and tell mechanics who have been in the industry for 20 years how to fix a car you've never looked at? Maybe you walk into ERs and tell nurses and doctors what you think the people in the room are suffering from. 

You are the exact type of person no one can stand. Only when they move here, then complain about the weather, the people, and everything else. If you don't like it, leave. I'm sick of being insulted. It seems like kind of a dangerous policy.  Here's what I can see happening: 

Local driver stops for me to cross where there isn't a marked crosswalk, I start crossing because I now know about this rule. 

Driver behind local driver doesn't know about this rule and doesn't see me, gets pissed, peels off passing local driver in the opposing lane.  

Best-case scenario I dive out of the way like an action hero, worst-case my son is now an orphan.

I'll just, uh, be really damn careful whenever this scenario comes up from now on. Not stupid when your goal is to rake in some revenue.  I observed it happen in the U District.  A pedestrian stepped into the road midway down the block.  They were hit by a car (but not badly hurt).  The police officer on the scene gave the pedestrian a ticket for jaywalking.  On the other hand I have seen several motorists receive tickets for not stopping for pedestrians standing at an intersection waiting to cross. Or people should have the common sense not to cross an unmarked intersection with cars waiting. As if Seattle traffic wasn't already bad enough. Why yes chap, let's cross into oncoming traffic, what's the worst that could happen? The entitlement... 45 mph ≈ 72 km/h

I don't understand the two accidents. The first is presumably hitting the thing they are trying to avoid. The second would presumably be the following car hitting the breaking car, but you are ruling that one out saying that neither is because of following too close. So, what's the second accident? Dude, its exactly the same thing and I know because I moved to PGH for 4 years from Seattle. If you're not from the 'burg and like me, you hit the gas when the light goes green, its rather unexpected when the left turning truck facing you suddenly lurches into your lane because they were taking the Pittsburgh left but forgot that not everyone is from Pittsburgh and you didn't know. I almost got creamed crossing 5th at Negley my first month there. 

The point is, for people to behave predictably, everyone has to follow the same rules, even if they don't always make the most sense. Its much the same as waiting at a stop light in the middle of night and not blowing through it because you *think* there is no one else there. Yeah, but it's upon or within a roadway, a defined term that explicitly excludes the sidewalk and shoulder.

Not trying to be a dick, but as written, the law requires you to step into the road.


[Roadway](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.04.500)

>"Roadway" means that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily **used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the sidewalk or shoulder even though such sidewalk or shoulder is used by persons riding bicycles.** this part:

> when the pedestrian or bicycle is upon or within one lane of the half of the roadway upon which the vehicle is traveling or onto which it is turning. 

basically states states that the law applies to peds on the road, not at an intersection. if you're standing on the corner, i can ignore you um.. I just read this and it only says 'marked' crosswalks. And JUST BECAUSE IN YOUR STATE there is such a thing as an "unmarked crosswalk" doesn't mean that it exists everywhere. Many places have a "only in marked crosswalks" rule for pedestrians. In Delaware, a person must be on a sidewalk if one is available. If there is a crosswalk, one must be in it-only then do they have the right of way. If there is no crosswalk, please ensure that there are no vehicles coming toward you before  crossing the road. 
look left, right, left again -like we were taught when we were little.  Fun fact.  In the united kingdom cars have the right of way and they will not stop Yield, not right of way. There's a distinct difference.  As my dad used to say, "Right-of-way doesn't mean shit if you're dead."  Just because the asshat was able to avoid a collision doesn't mean he wasn't tailgating.  So I can hug your fucking bumper as long as I don't hit you when you stop suddenly?  I'm sure that's in the driving manual somewhere. I've been driving for 40 years. Never been in an accident. Weird. Yes but I would still hope a driver would attempt to stop and not decide that because they aren't at fault they should just keep going.  Of course, because whenever someone comes to a complete stop in front of you when they aren't supposed to or expected to, you are always going to come close to hitting them. That's how momentum works.

Did OP piss in your coffee this morning or something? For most cars, it is not possible to get up to the speed of traffic with the amount of space given.  So if you come to a complete stop and then try to floor it when there is an opening you are doomed.   You're the problem! If there's no space to move in then the people in the lane you are trying to merge into also aren't merging correctly. That definitely isn't your fault but I'd say be more aggressive about it, as well. I don't mean play bumper cars with other drivers but if you're already going at a crawl you need to force people to let you in at the correct spot. By not being aggressive you further create backups.  No, they shouldn't be merging all over, that slows it down. Only the car in the front, where the lane ends. You need me to explain why lane splitting on the freeway to  intentionally block traffic is dangerous? Are you an idiot?

You will cause a serious crash when someone doesn’t notice or properly process your illegal and abnormal behavior.  We are not conditioned to avoid cars lane splitting... Blocking a lane is dangerous.  Never let those people in, they knew they had to exit, they can get the next one. That's not zipper merging.  No, you are merging at the same speed traffic is going. If you are in front of another vehicle you have right of way. If they hit you from behind they are at fault.

Be aggressive, but if they are absolutely not letting you in, I don't know what to say. Those are outliers and they are doing it wrong. I mean, usually I use my car. But I'm also a far braver driver than most in Seattle (thanks Massachusetts!), so... I didn't say it was, I just pointed out that many of the things that people do to try to prevent it (despite requests from WSDOT not to) *are* illegal.  

I'm not the person you responded to who said it's illegal.  I just hate the people who think they're helping by blocking lanes of traffic. triggering you i guess? sorry pal.  > Recall that we are quite vulnerable and are surrounded by deadly machines.

Yeah, but you do it by choice knowing the risk. To say you are vulnerable and expecting drivers to feel sympathetic about it doesn't really mesh. My biggest problem with bicyclists has always been they want the benefits of cars and pedestrians at the same time. You can't have both. 

Pick one and follow. If you want to share the road, follow the same rules of keeping within the lines and not drifting too close into the other lanes that it impedes their flow. Just keep in mind vehicles in the lane next to you need to have three feet minimum between your bike and their car lol I forgot to read that chapter in the history book where Eisenhower greatly expanded the highway system so we could get around on bikes easier.

The bike accommodations are being shoe horned in at the expense of both smooth traffic flow and taxpayer money.  Take a license test to get a bicycle license to register your bicycle. That way you can help pay your share for the infrastructure. Oh wait, let me guess you wouldn’t like that would you? It's not impossible. I do it every day. Yes, people do merge in front of me. I back off to a safe distance from them and carry on.  This has happened to me... people can be insanely impatient.  Yes, the entitlement. Part of the reason traffic is bad is because people don't understand the rules of the road (even if they might not make sense to them) and invent their own, confusing everyone. If you drive in Seattle, learn the rules so we're all on the same page! Good bot Sorry, but you're wrong. Someone braking out of nowhere can cause an accident easily even if you're following at a safe distance. That effect can back up in a line of traffic with people consecutively having to brake faster and more. 

Please stop whining about this. I feel the same way about your driving. I know, sounds ridiculous, doesn't it (hint). You can feel whatever you like but you're still factually wrong. The second accident requires a new car. The first accident requires new underwear. EDIT: Actually, I still think you have to stop if a pedestrian is standing on the sidewalk at a crosswalk.  "Within one lane .. of the roadway" would seem to extend the area to include the sidewalk beyond the narrowly defined roadway.  Why should it stop at the road's edge?  If that was the desired result, then the author of the law could have just said "upon the roadway." Perhaps there is case law on this point.  As I wrote below, I'm gonna continue to stop if a pedestrian is standing just next to the road and is clearly looking to cross.

EDIT2: Because I can't control myself I looked up the [definition of crosswalk](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/pedrcw.htm#crosswalk).  '"Crosswalk" means the portion of the roadway between the intersection area and a prolongation or connection of the farthest sidewalk line or in the event there are no sidewalks then between the intersection area and a line ten feet therefrom, except as modified by a marked crosswalk.'  So, someone standing on a corner "prolongation" is in the crosswalk, and drivers must yield to them. 

Fair enough.  I'll still stop if a pedestrian is perched on the curb and is clearly looking to cross, even though they should technically step just off the curb in order to invoke their right of way.  That seems to align with the spirit of the law.

The worst is people perched on the curb looking at their phone.  Do you want to cross or don't you?  Hmm.. you're not moving.. ok, I'll turn.  Damn it!  You start to cross as I'm about halfway through my turn and now I'm stuck in the middle of the intersection blocking a lane of traffic. Wrong. Upon does not have that meaning. If it did, they wouldn't include the redundant term of within. Upon means you're at the crosswalk. Not still walking up the sidewalk and about to be upon the sidewalk but you're there waiting to cross. If you're started to cross then you're within the sidewalk. 

You do not have to have stepped onto the road.  As I wrote above, I disagree.  If a pedestrian is standing within a step or so of the road and appears to be wanting to cross, I'm going to stop for them as that seems to be in keeping with the spirit of the law.  

When I'm a pedestrian and I don't want cars to stop (waiting for a bus or lyft or whatever), I take pains to make it clear that I don't intend to cross, standing well back from the crosswalk.  Perhaps you're annoyed with people that are ambiguous about their intentions.  I am too. Yup, but it seems people are upset with me for pointing out that right of way does not mean legal. If someone was tailgating and someone else stopped abruptly from 45PMH, there would have been a collision. Sorry, but you're completely wrong here. I guess it's easier to double down on a false statement than to own up that you were wrong.  good for you?
 If you leave enough distance you'll never come close to hitting them.

Get off your damn phones and pay attention. I'm just saying given two options of either making someone have to slow down slightly to let me in or going full speed into a motorcycle I can't see, one is preferable to the other. Maybe you should try looking ahead of where youre driving that usually helps  In what way though I'm usually behind those people when I do want to exit and they make me wait. I-5 North at the LCW exit is notoriously bad for this. [deleted] [deleted] || It's the law

^^ This is the post you replied to. 

You wanted to know why you were being downvoted, so I answered. Someone asked for a Citation about zipper merging being the law, and you replied with something that was not a law, but just a suggestion and then you spewed your opinion along with it. I did not downvote you, but that's probably why it happened.  Oh yeah, triggering. Is that your go to when someone calls you out for not knowing what you're talking about?  That is not my responsibility to ensure. It's actually that *I* need three feet between my bicycle and your car. 

Believe me. As a cyclist, I never forget this. Especially when big box trucks feel the need to pass me without proper distance given, just because they don't want to wait for the oncoming car to clear.  How about you go read the chapter where the country had public transportation infrastructure that was forced out by the much less efficient private automobile, then cities started being built to accommodate cars. This made it more difficult to add in public transportation infrastructure later when we realized the benefit of it. And in and of itself it's turned into an urban planning nightmare. It heavily contributes to a sprawl design in a city over centralized neighborhoods, meaning people have to go farther to meet their basic needs and entertainment. I means parking accommodations now take up as much as 25% of most cities, meaning 25% of land in a city is now largely inactive. It takes the place of housing or businesses, yet generates no revenue to support the economy if the parking is free and employs little to no people. This is why they're referred to as urban "deserts". And it's still not adequate. A study in in 2001 showed that in congested areas such as downtown, 30% of traffic is made up of people simply looking for parking.

But no, by all means lets demonize people who ease these issues and instead just keep adding to this problem. I know how much we all love traffic!

PS - I don't ride a bike, I think they're terrifying. But I do make heavy use of public transit. Most local streets and roads were paved due to the efforts of cyclists. I pay sales tax, which is where the state and localities get a majority of their income. Why would I like anything about that? More government and more bikes sounds like hell. I hate it when this happens on the freeway though.  When the guy in front insists on going exactly 60 causing folks (who want to speed, etc.) to merge in front of them by going into the right lane and then the 60 MPH car slows to gain back their following distance every time and next thing you know the entire lane is going 56 on a clear roadway cause of someone's requirement for a certain following distance.  (I may have to drive with this person often.) I don't know why, but it just irks me because the greatest danger is unpredictability and negatively affecting with the flow of traffic, more so than any specific stopping distance can offer. but then another car merges in front of you after you back off and you're not at a safe distance anymore until you back off again, but then another car merges in front of you after you back off and you're not at a safe distance anymore until you back off again, but then another car merges in front of you after you back off and you're not at a safe distance anymore until you back off again, but then another car merges in front of you after you back off and you're not at a safe distance anymore until you back off again, but then another car merges in front of you after you back off and you're not at a safe distance anymore until you back off again, but then another car merges in front of you after you back off and you're not at a safe distance anymore until you back off again, but then another car merges in front of you after you back off and you're not at a safe distance anymore until you back off again We could all start by using a blinker and not cutting people off in the road

That's quite convincing. Hilarous.

I still think one should follow cars at a distance where they can stop in time even if the car in front stops short. Sometimes they stop short legitimately. One can't control when the car in front stops but one can control how much distance one allows oneself to react. >crosswalk means the portion of the roadway

So, we're back to a crosswalk being a portion of the roadway (which used for vehicles and excluding the sidewalk or shoulder).  I'm not sure what your point is.  They could have stated "within two feet of the edge of the roadway" if the RCW was to include people at the side of the road.

I fully expect to have to stand in the parking/edge lane to assert my intent to cross.  The law doesn't apply to people standing on corners, by the strict legal definition of the law, as best I can tell.

EDIT:  I do appreciate your linking to the definition of crosswalk though, because I'd had trouble finding the citation for how wide an unmarked crosswalk is and your definition makes clear it's up to 10 ft wide or the distance between the roadway intersection and the furthest point on the sidewalk (describing the parallel to the crosswalk-sidewalk). The RCW didn't define upon, but I think if you parse "upon" or "within one lane of one half of the roadway" correctly you'll see that "upon" isn't redundant to "within".

yep. i can ignore them, though. You should read RCW 46.04.160 a few times before you try to bastardize it some more.  [removed] I've noticed there's some folks who go through whole lifetimes without any serious problems, and others who seem to have recurring bouts of bad luck. It's just an observation.

If someone has had three rear-end collisions in three years it indicates some sort of behavior that may lend to situations that end in accidents. Hi. Wasn't on my phone and stopped about four feet behind the person. I was paying attention and saw his brake lights turn on, but expected him to perhaps slow down for some reason I couldn't see. I put my foot on the brake but hadn't pressed down yet, and then I see the front of his BMW duck down see his tires basically stop and that's when I stomped on my brake. Wasn't tailgating. This was an asshole being an asshole thinking he was being kind.

I think he owes me new underwear. Just because someone could be extra attentive to avoid you doesn't mean what you're doing isn't dangerous... Idk, lots of things. Someone could try to go around you, go too far and slide down a hill, or maybe try to slide by you and your mirrors collide. It's even friendlier to let people in the front in than in the back. The ones in the back don't need it, they could just go up to the front. It's also a great way to create a super long backup while leaving precious lane space open.  Ok. I'm using my lane until it ends, then I'll get over, it's never a problem. See you on the other side, where we'll all catch up anyway. No. That's not how it works.  Yes, if you can find a spot to merge early, by all means. If you come to a stop early to do it, you are creating more traffic like a jerk. If you can't, then zipper at the end of the lane. If you can't do that...

You're asking for advice on merging on Reddit.

"What do you do if X, Y, and Z?"

Take the bus!    I didn't say it was a zipper merge, and I wasn't disagreeing with the comment I replied to. I just pointed out something that bothers me like everyone else in this post is doing. I was asking about a different situation where people justify their driving by claiming they're using all of the road or whatever. I'm a full supporter of using all the available roadway in a zipper merge situation. Just replying to that guys comment with a gripe I have with a similar but different situation.  Yep, and we share the road. If I can safely adjust my position so that we're both clear then so can you. Bikes do not ease anything. Also, last I checked, you can build both up and down on a piece of land so characterizing parking as being a scary spectre taking half of our land away is silly.

None of this changes the fact that bikers are assholes and the policies they support are expensive and poorly thought-out. That sounds like a fun thing to say with no truth to it whatsoever. You would think my commute would be bad if that were the case.  Again, no collision so I was at a safe distance. But you're forgetting that safe driving includes being predictable and not obstructing traffic. The person in front of me didn't have an emergency reason to stop (kid or even animal on the road). I appreciate your statement about safe distances, but it doesn't apply in this case.

If you'd like a better example, imagine following someone on the freeway, at freeway speeds, at a safe distance and have them come to a full stop as fast as their car is able with no legal reason to. I think then you'll understand better who was in the wrong here. And you can do that and stopping at 45MPH for no fucking reason in the middle of the road is really, really, really fucking stupid. As is complaining about people driving too closely when you'd don't know that they're driving too closely. Not only that, the law and the Washington State drivers guide requires it! Upon in this case means at but not within. As in, you're still walking to the crosswalk but you are not yet there. The driver does not have to stop. You are upon the crosswalk, the driver has to stop.

The state would not making a pedestrian laws that requires you to walk in front of an oncoming vehicle in order for them to have an onus to stop. That would be very unsafe.

The upon is there so that you don't have to stop if the pedestrian is not yet at the crosswalk. Like the laws mean anything to people around here. Tell that to the legion of left-lane campers on our highways.  I haven't down voted anyone in months. The only legitimate reason to down vote something is it being off topic. Your posts, while not making any sense, were very on topic and as such, I wouldn't ever down vote them. It looks like you have two down votes on each of your posts. 

I reported the person attack though.  Being stopped on a highway in traffic, being stopped at a stop sign and the last one was understandable as we came over a hill, traffic was stopped, I stopped in time, person behind me did not. 

You're right, I should no longer stop when traffic does, that's my problem. Can't hit a moving target right? I mean.  The whole point of lanesplitting is to stop people from getting by so they probably shouldnt be trying that anyways [deleted] So when he is discussing using the available roadway for a zipper merge you counter by going "What about here?" displaying something that isn't a zipper merge thus is off topic. You were called out for this, and your response was that I must be triggered to call you out for it. Now you are revising by adding previously unknown context to the situation in order to appear that's not what happened. 

The conversation is about using available roadway in a zipper merge. Your divergence into people using available roadway in a divergent lane makes even less sense with your attempted revision of events. Why not include that in your original statement? If that was your intent why have your initial response be "triggered"? It doesn't make sense why you would go about it this way if that was your intent.  I’m not sure what you’re suggesting.  How on earth do you figure that bikes don't ease anything? Put every biker in their own car as a single occupant. Does that negatively effect traffic or positively? I know it may feel like sharing the road slows you down and is a big bother, but statistically you're incorrect about it not easing anything.

>Also, last I checked, you can build both up and down on a piece of land so characterizing parking as being a scary spectre taking half of our land away is silly.

It's not a scary spectre unless you're a child under the age of 10 who is somehow really on the up and up with civil engineering. Everything I said was just a literal fact we deal with. Speak to any urban planner. At this point however we're probably closer to it being solved by self-driving vehicles rather than alternative transportation. 

But I digress, I just thought it ridiculous that someone was taking the stance that the most expensive and space inefficient solution for traveling (individual vehicles) is somehow the tits because we decided to make interstate highways 60 years ago. It is true. Look at the history:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Roads_Movement I don't know anything about your commute, only mine. And when you leave that much space, people will jump in front of you. And if you continue to do it, it continues to happen. There is a happy, and legal medium. Not tailgating, far enough away that when a situation like OPs occurs, you can safely stop, as OP did. 

Congrats on not having a bad commute while living in Seattle tho!! I wasn't making any judgment about right or wrong. My first comment was about how yielding right of way unexpectedly is dangerous. I was pointing out that a situation can have more than one dangerous aspect. There you go, gettin' logical on me. 

As someone once said: These bad things are actually preventing you from far worse things that may have happened if not for these smaller things. I hope we can get to the bottom of this, I'm interested that people think so differently about things like this.

Ok, if you don't mind me asking, why are you trying to stop them getting by anyway? In my view other cars shouldn't be blocking lanes where traffic is possible/likely. It's a jagged thorn in a situation where for everyone's safe travels (driving), you want there to be vehicles moving smoothly, and no collisions. At best, it seems kinda pointlessly mean, trying to control others when they aren't harming you, at worst, it could be a hazard. 

People in the lane driving to the end until their merge point aren't cheering because they left you behind, it's because it works better, and overall, everyone gets through faster if you add one car at a time, in the front, rather than everyone slowing down over and over to let 10 cars in, at the same time. It's better to merge together one car at a time in the front. It's been proven, I'll Google it for you if you want. Here you go. Merging lanes at the end gets everyone through 15% faster, and reduces the length of lines by 50%.

https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/why-last-second-lane-mergers-are-good-for-traffic.amp.html  That is completely wrong. This is exactly the whole point of this thread, when people are uninformed and think they are being "friendly" but in reality are making traffic worse. 

Here is some information about zipper merging and how it is so much more efficient than "getting in the end of the line".

Traffic is a team sport, there is no "line" when stuck in traffic and a lot of these ideas of I was here first and I just want to be friendly in reality make it so that we all get to where we are going later than necessary. 

 No. It speeds it up. 

https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/why-last-second-lane-mergers-are-good-for-traffic.amp.html I didn't revise, I clarified for you, because you seemed to assume i was disagreeing with the comment i replied to. I didn't realize my change of topic would upset anyone or get me "called out". I didn't include my feelings on zipper merges because it wasn't necessary...

I said you were "triggered" bc your reply made it seem like my comment upset you, which I found ridiculous. I was simply sharing a particular part of road where i've been upset by other drivers actions just like everyone else in this thread, except you, who seem to be focused on calling people out for changing topics mid thread.  > Self driving vehicles

You finally said a correct thing.

Also, if we didn't have delusional people splitting up our DoT money on different fairy-tale projects like bike lanes and light rail, the inefficiency of the single-car would be mitigated in higher capacity highway systems. It's 35 minutes each way but it's pleasant. Mountain and sound views. If others want to get to work faster and merge in front of me, that's fine.  Didn't think you were making a judgement :). Just stating that in this case, there wasn't a reason for the driver to stop, let alone stop as quick as he did. Dude youre not getting it i understand merging like that works, its just nobody does it correctly and it ends up taking way fucking longer than it should. [deleted] How is light rail a fairy tale project? Almost every major city has a light rail system and most of them are actually very convenient, especially since they are not dependent on the flow of car traffic. > DoT money on different fairy-tale projects like bike lanes and light rail

What DoT money?

At the Federal level at best a pittance goes to surface transportation modes other than roads and transit. Transit is a much smaller share than roads.

With WSDOT no money is going to light rail, none. WSDOT may spend a small amount on bike infrastructure but it is for things like the 520 bike trail which don't really add much in the way of cost compared to the amount spent on cars.

At the city level, yes SDOT does spend money on bikes and transit but again it is a relatively small amount of the overall budget.

Most of the transit spending is on buses, though some is for streetcars which are a form of "light rail".

> the inefficiency of the single-car would be mitigated in higher capacity highway systems.

You'd be surprised at how little the money the various levels of DoT spend on bikes and rail transit would buy in terms of road or highway infrastructure.

Furthermore the fundamental geometry of cars isn't going to change no matter how much money you throw at highways. In terms of people per hour, walking, biking, and transit are much more space efficient. 

In commercial space terms going above about .4 FAR means congested roads if everyone is driving alone. Did you watch the videos? 

 Because we lose a huge amount of money on every passenger 

https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2015/06/03/the-10-u-s-metro-rail-systems-that-lose-the-most-money-per-passenger/

Fairy tale. You want it to be great, but it just isn't, and you willed it into existence anyway. Would be a bunch of cool points if you forget that our whole country's infrastructure was built around the car.

I'm sure the Netherlands would have loved a badass rail system after coal supplanted air and water power, and I'm sure the British wanted an amazing road system after oil supplanted coal. But they didn't because their infrastructure was built for a different paradigm.

You can't just undo 70 years of infrastructure and development. This is throwing good money after bad, and you only have to look at history to know it. Roads and streets don't exactly turn a profit in most cases. Those are all in smaller metro areas and/or systems undergoing extensive construction. Of course the transit authority in this area is operating at a loss, they're building a ton of rail systems they can't yet use. Why on earth would you think they are currently making money while simultaneously undertaking one of the largest construction projects in the entire country? FWIW passenger rail in the Netherlands both urban and long-distance is way better than anything in the states.

You can build the infrastructure from scratch. European countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and Austria have built most of their much lauded bike infrastructure fairly recently. Instead we have the worst of both worlds. We pay for roads and bridges on both sides - massive tax spends, and never ending tolls.

On a for-profit road system, you only pay the toll.

Tell me how your system is preferable, exactly? It's not about overall net profit. It's about subsidy per rider being outrageous. You're just making excuses for it now. And it took the Netherlands 150 years to get there. And they lost their super power status in that time. OK so where is your utopia where the roads are all 100% for profit? OK there captain, I'll just give you 120% of my trust since obviously you're way smarter than me. Wut? The era where the Dutch could be considered a superpower was a bit further back (most of the 17th Century). Even after the end of that era they remained a wealthy, well educated, and prosperous country with a highly developed culture. We live in a country where Donald trump was elected with roughly 30 million votes. Common sense does not always percolate to the top. Not only can you not find such a thing in the US, you can't find such a thing anywhere in the world.

Even in closed private communities like Disneyworld the roads are subsidized infrastructure rather than themselves being a profit center.
