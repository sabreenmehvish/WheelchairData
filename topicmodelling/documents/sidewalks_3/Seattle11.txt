No trip to Seattle is complete without seeing a row of tents on the sidewalk sharing a shit bucket.  Pete Holmes and the worthless scum city council will be so happy to see this. A dream come true. User name checks out LMAO! such a wonderful city  Drove by this same spot earlier today. This is one of the more cleaned up tent rows. The city council should be ashamed. way more people are poor than you think The “real Seattle”
What a joke city we have. Real world class. Lol it's clean because they just setup there, i rode by on friday and saw a couple of guys putting up their tents there. It's embarrassing when I have family in town and I want to show them the sights and we are driving by shit like that all morning. The money they dump into this issue and the lack of results is ridiculous.
