Spotted this in Greenwood  Please walk by periodically and let us know how this escalates. üçø Seems pretty likely the owner (or their contractor) drew the line for reasons other than to be a snooty jerk. I have a friend trying to remodel his house, and he's running into restrictions based on where his property line is in relation to his house and the sidewalk proper. This is the most Seattle interaction between two neighbors I have ever seen. Passive-aggressive in nature and a healthy dose of no respect for property rights. Will probably be a big headache for whoever lives on the right. The place on the left was a 400 sq ft house that was listed for 400 or 500k if I remember correctly. [removed] i gotta say, the lettering looks really nice! Lol this is amazing But... 

^why ^is ^it ^backwards. Well you write something in all caps in our post internet world, you are gonna set somebody off.  FUH!  It sold for $890K...Dang!! Classic Seattle Passive-aggressors! The city could resolve this by, you know, treating Greenwood like the rest of the city and putting in sidewalks. That might take money away from their cause of attracting every junkie in the country to move here.  Classic! I know this situation: shared driveway little house on the right was bought, upgraded, and put on the market for high $800's:  https://click.mail.zillow.com/f/a/oKAbHJCoskvUnon4NOUsdg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRdQFwfP0UUZW1vLXNlbmR0b2ZyaWVuZC1oZHAEVwZ6aWxsb3dCCgAVH9ddW5fKQS5SE2tkd2llZ2FuZEBnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAAA~?target=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zillow.com%2Fhomedetails%2F48996089_zpid%2F%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Demo-sendtofriend-hdp%26rtoken%3Dcfb31582-d21b-46c0-b193-18cd09b42cad~X1-ZUve9pr7w6voqx_5taq2

Neighbor in shitty little house on the left, likely pissed that his hovel wasn't worth even half that, executed dick move with rattle can an the upgraded house did not sell for months.  Welcome to Seattle!

(Update: hovel was put on the market recently for $435k. )
 Response is upside down. Telling himself to fuck off. Lol! [removed] It appears the reason is so that parking doesn't occur there. JFC, how did you find that?  Except for the half that's upside-down.  Totally illegal! Where is mobility Mary! She wouldn‚Äôt stand for this That's a driveway. That picture was... taken from the sidewalk. Agreed, though those of us south of 85th do have sidewalks.  I‚Äôm in a part of north Seattle that doesn‚Äôt h e sidewalks and I actually don‚Äôt mind it. Man, you can buy real estate for <500k in Seattle? When did that happen?  You sound like a lovely person. Have you considered moving to places that might appreciate you? I hear Laurel, Mississippi is nice this time of year.  Ohhh, I see that change in asphalt on the right is not the end of the sidewalk. Gotcha...

Yeah, fuck that guy. 84th is not that long in Greenwood. So using the OP drawing. It was easy to find with Zoom in overhead Satellite view to find it. Street view confirmed it. Unbelievable! [deleted] This was on 84th. So there was a sidewalk. Georgia...consider Georgia. is that really a dick move? locks like you could still park there, just 2 feet clear from the fence excuse me sir!  No MS paint but would you accept a ballpoint pen drawing that is not to scale and from memory? I signed up for imgur just for you!

It looked like the driveway provides access to garages for both houses. Given the awfulness of parking in that area, especially with new apartments with zero parking possibly going up, losing access to those spots could really suck. I think it makes sense to see it from [Google Maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/92olp4/spotted_this_in_greenwood/e37wqlu) Haha. I am jealous of their half a driveway each. Maybe they can figure out an alternate day plan? That‚Äôd be the first time anyone did.
