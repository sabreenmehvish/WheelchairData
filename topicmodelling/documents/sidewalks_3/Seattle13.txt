Amps and loud speakers on public sidewalks I’m just curious what the deal with this is. There are several places around the city where someone is singing/panhandling and they have a loud speaker for their microphone and/or instruments plugged into a public outlet. It’s incredibly irritating to me walking by and I imagine if I lived in an apartment where this was a daily occurrence it would cause me to move. Is this allowed? Allowed? who knows

Enforced? Most definitely not I don't think it's a bad thing when they offer something in return for some bucks. busking is a fact of life There are sound ordinances however the quiet hours in Seattle are 10pm-7am weekdays and 10pm-9am weekends  I doubt it is allowed.  I work in construction, not in city anymore, Fuck that!  Getting a street use permit is easy enough just go to city hall, pay the fee and set up all your signage.  Same with obstructing sidewalks. Bet you love the one-man band dude who plays every weekend at 5th & Pine. Hearing his voice from two blocks away just makes me cringe It’s not allowed and you can call the spd non emergency line to report them. Hahahaha, yeah as if the city could do anything about it.  I just wish they’d offer it a little quieter. Don’t hang out outside the stadiums.
This “ evangelist” had his speaker on 13,my teeth rattled when I walked by. Guess I'm used to the New Orleans street scene. You just expected to hear music playing on every corner, at all times, day and night. It was part of our life.

But I do understand if you live nearby, your used to quieter streets, and you trying to get some sleep. We're not all acclimated.

Cheers! That’s what I’m saying, why is something that loud allowed? There are apartments in that area. How did you vote in the last election?
