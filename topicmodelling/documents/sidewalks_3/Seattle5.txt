Seattle’s Sidewalk Etiquette Sucks Serious Shit  [deleted] How's that blog working out for you? I agree with every point in that post. Shame you have to spell it all out, though. Blogger spam Kind of true, but not for actual Seattlites and therein lies the real problem. More than not the sidewalk is blocked by crowds of tourists, often taking photos, sometimes congregating at a car or in front of a place they just left.

So I would add this to the golden rule of tourism: don't act like a tourist. You lost me at when you wrote I moved here 10 years ago.  "**Etiquette Sucks Serious Shit"**

Dwell on this sentence fragment. Lol i mean wjat i hate are the people that walk all over top of you. I get it youre faster than me gfy. Especially downtown.  Heck yeah, just be aware of your surroundings and try to respect others. I think the latter is the real problem. We treat each other like shit. I’m a native Seattleite and lived in another state for a while. Came back and there was an elevated degree of ass-holery up here. It’s probably just math.  Only the most intellectual of specimens appreciate this artistic genius  10 years is enough to count as a local. you spelled autistic wrong Is it, though? I don't understand why writers bring it up at all. Just don't mention when you moved here.  Nope, if you weren't born here you never will truly be a "real" local.

Not that I really care, but enough "locals" seem to.
