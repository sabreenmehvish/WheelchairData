1910 Seattle Garbage Collection - Satisfaction guaranteed or your garbage back.  Wow.  That street and sidewalk are way nicer than the ones in front of my Seattle house.  Granted, that's probably the nicest street in the city then, but still, 100 years later... Were you making a P&R reference? https://www.reddit.com/r/PandR/comments/a235lc/satisfaction_guaranteed_or_your_trash_back/?st=JP5S19MI&sh=f45ef713 Then they dumped it into Lake Union. It's actually 1915.

Edit: I think this is the spot:

Belmont between Olive and Pine. The 'Consulate' apartment building is now where the little Craftsman was, but the house in the middle is still there 103 years later. I thought this was a screen cap from RDR2. Is this 15th Ave on Capitol Hill? One horsepower and their customer service was still better than Waste Management.  This looks like modern day Kirkland by the lake All that street parking! hey look, it's one of those $200/month cans Still better than WM Those windows are beautiful!  Mackinac Island in Michigan still collects garbage this way. Imagine the back injuries, first guy hoists can to second, and dump.  Lots of lift and twists. Apology accepted Was this on Pikes St? this was the last time the trash in Seattle wasn't 90% used needles It would be cool to know exactly what this looks like today. Its probably still the same sidewalk and road lmao I think they look nice cause theyâ€™re brand new.  I feel like you're in the ballpark. I lived there for several years and this is definitely familiar  1625 Belmont ave.  Clearly there are two horses in this picture... It's almost like privatizing utilities and government functions is a bad idea... Sigh... again with the Pikes
Yes right be the Nordstroms across from the Olympics Mountains, but south of Greens lake Upvote, cause comedy. Hopefully it now has some trees. Fun fact: All that garbage is what made Mercer Island!  Probably has a pile of used syringes and a derelict RV full of homeless people and the hoses are still going for $700-800K I used to walk down that street very often when I lived on the Hill. I feel like I recognize those 3 buildings in that particular order  Nice! Thanks! Holy shit. Spot on. The building on the left is now a big brick building, but the other two are more or less the same. The road looks like crap now though lol https://imgur.com/a/LwVUdLd Sorry this has been so hurtfuls for you.  Nope. Two out of the three buildings are still there though.

Looks like the new garbage bin would fill the entire horse garbage cabin. Amazing.  How did you find it? Seattle municipal archives and Street View. I spend a lot of time looking at maps.
