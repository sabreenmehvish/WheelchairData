Painting of Pike Street sidewalk in the rain.  ... is this for sale? Where can this painting be purchased? Its beautiful.  This is really cool. It truly captures the feeling of Pike Place in the rain.  When it is raining hard this is exactly what it looks like with the water streaming down my glasses. I love this. I'm part of an art Docet program at my children's elementary school and I would love to share this with our older children to give them an example of this style by a local artist. Do you have a link to your work? Would you consider pming me with your details so I may share this? Thank you very much. Beautiful  If you paint with an umbrella, the colors wouldn’t run so much I bet. I believe this is from a Canadian artist who will commission work. This is an older post. Unless I’ve been completely bamboozled by the internet.  It's a Canadian artist who paints many cityscapes in this way. If you go on their username you can see all the other paintings they've done I believe google  Thank you , glad it came across well .
