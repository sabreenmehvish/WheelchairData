"People see my wheelchair and invent limits —project those limits on to me— and then, are impressed by my ability to overcome limits that didn't exist in the first place."-Erin Clark  This. ad infinitum. I use a rider cart when shopping because I am diabetic and have an ulceration on the bottom of my foot which the more I walk on the worse it gets so rather than walk through the store.. I ride.    


When people see me stand up for a second to load a case of water or something heavy into my cart or from my cart to the trunk of my car I get looks sometimes like... "He's faking!"  This is kind of the inverse to your post, but I think it's built on the same sort of preconceptions that people shouldn't hold.   


My point is, never live your life worrying about what other people think, because they don't know the whole story only you know your whole story.  And generally people are dumb, just look at any elected leader you choose.  People actually voted for that person.  And that's not a statement for or against any particular party, look at the average politician of any stripe and realize, someone thought that was the best option.  HOLY CRAP.    Limits? What are those? The most meaningful thing: Not caring about other people's discomfort with her body. Just being comfortable in her own skin.  I want that for my son.  It's a very nuanced thing that I have been thinking about, but she said it so much more clearly than my paraphrasing.  She is who she is, my son is who he is, and they are both exactly the way they should be.  They don't need to be "fixed".  That is someone else imposing their idea of normal on them.
