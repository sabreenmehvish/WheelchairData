Counters in places being more accessible for adults that are short in stature because of a condition and/or are a wheelchair user! (A post on my blog https://sarahandscoliosis.blogspot.com)  

When  i have been to places such as bingo or pubs, i have noticed counters are high up.  It can be hard for me to see over them sometimes.  I know it might not be possible, but it would be good if counters were lower down in places, so people like me that are short in stature for their age because of a condition/disability and are/or are a wheelchair user can reach them .  I was born with a spinal condition called Scoliosis.  I am 34 years old and 4ft in height.

I know places might not see many adults like me that are short in stature for their age, because of a condition/disability, but i think they should think about counters being more low down, so people like me can see over them. I am with you. I agree that something should be done. I agree. Idk why they do it that way
