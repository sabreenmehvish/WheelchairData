We need your help, so if you are looking to purchase a car whether it‚Äôs through Motability or your own private car/WAV, what are the key things you need a car to have for you to choose your new car? Please comment below as we are going to be creating a list of all yours answer üòÅüòÅ  I watched your last vid and would love to see a series. One with a Motability focus would be particularly fab as there is a lot of choice and it's difficult to narrow down, particularly for people who've never had a car before. There were a few points that could have been covered better for me personally;

* **Transferring wheelchair into car** - You covered the boot space well and the self transfer but most of the time I'm going to be transferring, dismantling my chair, lifting it over me and placing in the passenger/back seat. How easily does the passenger seat move forward from driver position, how's the roof height, do standard 24" wheels fit in the footwell easily, how much overall space is there to fling your frame into the back seat. Bear in mind that while some chairs have a back that folds down like your own, others are a fully fixed frame. Keep the boot section for people who have assistance or can walk from boot to driving seat. 

* **Boot height from chair** - Getting shopping into the boot is a nuisance sometimes from chair height, especially if you have to lean on the car to reach it really dirties up your clothes. 

* **Hand controls** - No mention of these. I appreciate you're a standard automatic driver and won't use these but a wee line about their availability in general would be helpful. A link to another reviewer who uses them perhaps? Or even to the very brief explanations on the Motability site. 

* **General hand friendly-ness** - Things like are the door handles easy to use (some are stiffer than others), where are the intuitive handholds (official or improvised), how easy is the seatbelt to reach and pull, what's the key fob like.  

* **Seat** - No mention of the seat height or recline adjustment options, though I do like how you covered the the forward/back motion and mentioned accidentally pressing the buttons with your arse. Totally something a lot of people who transfer will do. Does it come with lumbar support, AFAIK only some Motability vehicles come with this.

* **Doors** - This was very briefly covered in video at the end but nothing said about it! I find it helpful to know which way the doors open, how difficult/heavy they are and how far they open, as it makes a difference both for throwing in my chair and in certain parking spaces. 

I totally want the park assist though hahaha. How handy that looks!

 Low doors! No suburban business here. I need to be able to get in and out and not risk my life did it! Low doors also help with loading the wheelchair in  Hi, you have totally the wrong end the stick, we are both disabled (wheelchair users) and have setup a business to HELP disabled people that are less fortunate than us as we want to make a difference, we are sorry that you are annoyed however we are only trying to help.  Listen, I might be choosing this thread to lose my shit on, but if you‚Äôre going to use this community as a focus group you need to compensate people for their time in some form. You can‚Äôt just march in here and not list who you are, who you work for, and for what purpose you are collecting information. This happens so much on this subreddit and I‚Äôm so sick of it. I know how studies and focus groups work. There‚Äôs usually paperwork for consent and some type of compensation for time. You don‚Äôt get to take our ideas and struggles and pass them off as your own so you can collect. 

If you are a student, we aren‚Äôt here to do your homework. There are secondary sources, blog posts, videos and journal articles where you can find **and cite** information. I‚Äôm on my down time.  compensation and consent A bit of context to the post would have likely helped.  Then what you need to do is get in contact with a *local* non-profit organization who can connect you with *willfully consenting participants* after your legal team has drafted a release that your participants have signed stating you can use their information and that you will compensate them for their time. I understand that you might be coming from an honest place, but taking ideas from a supportive space on reddit is not the place to do so. Or you know, you could ignore the post and move on. Downvote if you think it's not constructive to the community. No-one here is forcing you to reply to this post, if you choose to you become a willing participant. Personally I dislike seeing the same endless questions about the disability process in the US, as there are plenty of local and online sources to tackle those. So I skip over them and read something else. 

I consider two people with disabilities making an informative video series about how to choose a car very helpful and supportive. Having someone do the legwork in trying out different cars and asking for exactly what features you want tested, well I consider that a fantastic reward in itself. It's not *quite* the same as some college student going 'what disability aid would help you' with zero background work done beforehand.  Downvote me to the ends of the earth but know that in research we give people forms before asking for opinions. 

This is a weird hill to die on, but this is also my job, and everything my college has ever done has had to be run by an ethics committee before being sent out, no matter how well intentioned or who it‚Äôs being run by. If you want to post here fine, but know your rights, which they didn‚Äôt state to you. You don‚Äôt know who they are or what they are going to do with this info, ie take credit for it. That‚Äôs all I was saying, I don‚Äôt really understand why I‚Äôm getting hate for this.

You could have also moved on. I did not downvote you, I upvote *everyone* I reply to unless they are being directly and deliberately insulting. I replied to you as I had a different viewpoint as to why this is helpful to me, a person who uses a wheelchair, and thought you might like to hear it. If not please let me know, I can tag you to know not to do the same in the future. 

We can agree to disagree. I don't think asking for what people want in a review video is the same as dealing with an ethics committee in a published paper, which I've also worked with in the past. By presenting my opinion here I'm aware that the OP will take my ideas and use them, that's okay with me.

I'm overall very happy to give out ideas that will help make life for others more accessible. I give feedback to my engineer about my wheelchair use, report medication side effects to the relevant scheme, put reviews about wheelchair accessibility online...all without compensation or official ethical approval. If I can help to make a future person's life easier with information I already have, that's compensation enough. If it's not for others, they don't have to give their ideas away.
