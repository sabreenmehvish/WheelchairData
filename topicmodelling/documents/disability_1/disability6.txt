Here is the famous Nissan Leaf Review which caused quite a stir here on reddit whilst we was filming 😁😁😁 #tdr  Sorry, I'm out of the loop. Why did this cause a stir? I'd never seen a wheelchair that comes apart like that so it confused me when he first put the wheels in the trunk I would like to see more reviews like this.
The music was annoying.
