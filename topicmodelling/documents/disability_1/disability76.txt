I’m interested to know what people think this symbol means ? I’d love to know first impressions. Apologies for those who cannot see it but if I describe it I will influence how people interpret it - I promise to try and fill you in later  Probably like a disabled girl power feminist type thing. Sit on a fit ball  Reminds me of a female warrior with a shield images I've seen. I don't automatically see a wheelchair user.   At first I thought it was a woman with a really big butt. an active female athlete First impression was a rockstar on a fitness ball. It looks to me like a person with a ponytail in a wheelchair giving a peace sign.  I’m British, which colours my response a little. Because you can’t tell which way round her fingers are facing (palm toward her or away from her), she’s flipping people off. So I’d say it’s the emoji you use when someone does something they think is helping but it’s not, or the emoji you use when someone does something really rude like move your wheelchair without asking or fly-by petting your service dog.  Honestly, I don't know if I would have if it hadn't been posted here.  But think of it as an emoji or symbol - what would it represent  "I'm good, don't need any help, thanks!"
