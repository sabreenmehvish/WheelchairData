I was commended(!) for "faking" my disability. Just wanted to share a weird and frustrating thing that happened to me yesterday at my local march. I don't need mobility assistance in my day-to-day life, but for events like marches and rallies (or anything else where I can expect to be standing for long periods of time), I have a cane with a seat attached so I can either lean on it or sit down as needed. I'm 32, so I'm used to getting weird looks and "you're too young for that," but because I only bring it to events like this I also get a lot of, "that's such a good idea," "how useful," etc. People generally stop short of saying they want one for themselves unless they're older or also dealing with a disability. 

Until this guy.

No, this guy put out the usual wow, that's great for an event like this, etc., but then he quite seriously added -- and I'm paraphrasing, but not at all exaggerating -- "And you can just pretend to be disabled whenever you want and people will totally believe you."

Um. What? Obviously I told him I am disabled, but he just laughed and wandered away. I'm still just left blinking and puzzled over it. What a prick. I'm 35 and use a cane, and have trouble standing for long periods as well. I feel your pain. I get accused of faking it on occasion, and I generally just tell them where they can shove their opinion. Sometimes I'll make a smart ass comment about how they should try to get a job at the hospital since they clearly think they can do the job of an MRI machine they could save the hospital millions with their ability to see into people's bodies. A cane with a seat? How cool is that? Sorry for echoing but that sounds awesome.  Sorry about people.. I used to get looks and comments about my walking all life UNTIL I started using a cane. At first I still was getting around pretty good and didn't really put too much weight on it and was still getting the occasional comment about me being drunk, high or just got ass fucked. .. At least now, people can figure out pretty quickly that I'm disabled..soooo I guess that's a plus. I walk with a leg brace after fucking my leg up in an accident. The leg brace hides nicely under pants, so a lot of people I see day to day don't even realize I have it on. When I'm not wearing the brace, I use either crutches or a wheelchair. 

It's always fun when people who see you walk every day suddenly see you in a wheelchair. 🤷‍♂️ Next time say "my disability may not be visible, but your ignorance is" I bought a walker with a seat and also a basket last year and it's been one of the best purchases of my life.

I use mine when I'm shopping, going to medical appts, or any walking really. I used mine yesterday at the march thing here but I chose to be stationary rather than do the actual march I'm sorry but that guy is a fucking ignorant asshole also 32 and disabled, adn get the "too young to be sick" thing a lot! Sorry this happened to you! That does sound like an amazing idea and would be good for my disabled husband (fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis), where did you get it may i ask? This is why I’m afraid to use my walking stick in public :/ I’m terrified one day someone will confront me and accuse of some bs like this  Ignorant arrogance is pretty frustrating. I have suffered related comments but not nearly quite so... idiotic and nasty. I march with an electric scooter or a wheelchair in a pinch. I get a lot of that. 

For thing that don’t exhaust me, and therefore make me unsteady, I don’t usually use a mobility device, so it really throws off friends and family. It’s tiresome to constantly have to explain myself, but there’s no real way around it.  There are way too many assholes in the world. I have dealt with several on issues like this including people in my family. Keep your head up. i try to drop witting remarks all the time. after years of practice they normally get a really solid laugh but once in a while they miss their mark by a long shot. i could totally see myself saying something like this guy said in an effort to try and relate to someone. not excusing his behaviour just suggesting that maybe he didn't mean to imply that you weren't disabled. What. The. Fuck. Sadly. OP's experience may not be so uncommon with the definition of "disability" being so diluted nowadays. LOL, it actually is great for times like that. It's probably a little cumbersome for daily use and there's a bit of a learning curve for maneuvering without kicking it over (which I still do TBH) but it's so much better than trying to get through an event without an assist.

This is the one I use and it serves me pretty well! "Oh no! What happned!?"

"It's nothing new, this is just my life, some days I need a chair, some days I don't, I've told you about my chronic illness"

"Oh! I thought you'd been badly injured or gotten really sick or something, lol, you had me actually worried"

...*everytime* Amazon! This is the one I use: https://smile.amazon.com/Travelon-Walking-Seat-Cane-Size/dp/B001CZMXDE/ I'm not sure how I feel about this comment. There are probably a lot of people who think *I'm* not really disabled, since I'm generally mobile without assistance and am able to work part-time. I'm reluctant to engage in gatekeeping. [deleted] That does look pretty cumbersome ; must make an interesting gait pattern. It's been a long time since I've walked (spastic cerebral palsy, I use a chair full time) but assistive devices are always fascinating to me.
To actually address the OP, I've always wondered why people would *want* to fake disability, especially in settings where doing so gets them mostly negative reactions. I've heard horror stories about people faking illness for money, but they seem to be wild exceptions, certainly not the norm.  I actually fucked up my *right* knee over the weekend. Spent all day today at the hospital. Now I don't have a good leg to stand on. So I'm stuck in the wheelchair until Ortho says I can walk again. 😩 Thank you! Disability isn't binary and it's a spectrum. I think people need to get that through their heads. 

Sally's two broken legs doesn't mean Johnny's broken arm is magically better.

I'm in the same boat, I'm pretty independent and mobile, I have all my faculties, I can work casual hours, So many people would say I'm not disabled. But I have a chronic illness and symptoms effect me to varying degrees every day and they range from a mildly annoying headache which I agree isn't a disability, To dislocating my hips in my sleep from rolling over, and waking up unable to move or walk, then spending a few days afterwards in a wheelchair because of the instability, That happens 2-3 times a month, so when you look at my life overall, and look at the opportunities I have to study, hold down a job, have a routine to my lifestyle etc, my condition is disabling.   I’m not sure where you’re going with this. Just being diabetic isn’t cause to collect disability in the US. 

That said having people second guess my situation based on a narrow first impression leads to a lot of wrong assumptions.  >you can get disability benefits if you're diabetic.

Not in the US. You have to be practically dying to get approved here. I can sort of understand why a very immature/childish person would want to. My mother has a much more severe disability than I do, but when I was a kid, as much as I saw all the awful parts of it, I also saw the "we can skip the line at Disney World" and "she doesn't have to go to work when she doesn't feel well" parts and was sometimes jealous. I even played with her wheelchair sometimes.

Of course, that ended when I hit double digits, so IDK what this middle-aged dude's excuse was. I can only assume he never grew up. Oh hey, I have POTS too! And possibly MCAS, although not EDS. Chronic illness cousins. :)  I suppose I can understand that. I personally never liked any of the preferential treatment(and I still get it--people are much nicer to young adults in chairs VS those with canes, and that's another post entirely) , but I know plenty of others who never minded it.
