Would you feel comfortable using an autonomous or semi-autonomous wheelchair? (x-posted to r/wheelchairs) I've seen a lot of discussion surrounding the pros and cons of driverless cars (safety, addressing ethical dilemmas, human-car interactions especially if the car is semi-autonomous, etc.) With many companies and research institutions working on driverless wheelchairs, I was wondering what your thoughts are on them? 

Would they be helpful? Or would it be problematic to have a computer calculating a path for you and following it? What little edge cases, safety concerns, or social issues would you be most worried about?

(For reference, here's a diagram that describes different levels of autonomy. It's mainly talking about cars, but with a few changes you can see how it'd also be applicable to wheelchairs.)

&#x200B; I wouldn't use that kind of wheelchair because it would be a pain in the ass to reprogram the destination or whatever every time I forgot to grab something or realize I wanted chips. Day to day movement tends to be more spontaneous and fickle than driving. I HATE AUTONOMOUS THINGS. I will never use a chair that I'm not 100% in control of. There are a lot of ways to drive a power wheelchair including hand, head, chin, tongue, and even suck and blow controls.

I think for most power wheelchair users, programming the autopilot would take more fine motor skills and time than just driving there themselves.

Plus, insurance only covers what Medicare covers. I don't think Medicare would cover autopilot when it doesn't even cover a seat elevator, headlights, or a cup holder. Spending thousands more for autopilot could be better spent on other features.

I will say that it would be nice to have the chair stop so it wouldn't drive over someone's toes, but the dog has just learned to get out of the way and my husband is getting better at looking over his shoulder when in public. I work with the information system type technology that propels and informs autonomous vehicles and any type of autonomous navigation. I will never own an autonomous car, or an autonomous wheelchair for damn sure. I will not trust my safety with that. I saw the new Segway robot thing (my current chair is a Sui Generis Seat on a Segway) and it looked really cool, but of I'd use it for following me with bags and kit (I'm a filmmaker). In a chair, electric or manual, I enjoy myself too much just messing around while I go a to b and don't need that help. 

It might be a big help on days I'm in a confused haze because of the painkillers. I don’t think intelligent items are worth it most of the time. Sure, it’s cool when your sword steps in to talk to that sorcerer, but we all know it’s getting drunk and singing showtunes at night.  What about some of those lower levels of autonomy? Would you think that it would be useful to have an "autopilot mode" if you were tired or had to navigate a tricky space? Or the system might take control from you if it saw some oncoming threat that you were unaware of and steer you to safety? Interesting. Can you elaborate? What about the convenience or safety benefits? Yeah, it's pretty hard to imagine that Medicare would cover something like this anytime soon. I guess my question was more hypothetical, all questions of affordability aside. 
About the programming the autopilot -- I assumed the only thing that you'd need to program it to do is tell it where to go. Since the system is autonomous, not much else would be necessary. I guess typing in an address does require some fine motor skills, but what if there was a simpler interface that put places like home, work, grocery store, and pharmacy on something analogous to "speed dial"? What if, hypothetically, the system was advanced enough to always keep you physically safe? Would you still have reservations about using it? (E.g. communication problems, other social annoyances) I usually fare pretty well when it comes to those kinds of things, so no. The only way I could see this being useful for me is in a situation where I had to carry a lot of things and didn't feel like making 2 trips. I think for many of us handicapped people, the "autonomous object" thing takes away from our own, limited, autonomy. We use these things to maintain what little independence we have, so we don't want to give up even the *semblance* of choice, let alone the actuality of choice.

I don't speak for everyone, of course, but that's why I would never use an autonomous or non-manually-activated ([voice controlled](https://old.reddit.com/r/wheelchairs/comments/9rw1la/voice_control_questions/)) wheelchair, anyway. I react very unwelcoming to anything that may take away my autonomy, even in the "name of safety:" I hate the *idea* of a "[carer controller](https://www.magicmobility.com.au/wp-content/themes/MagicMobility/template-files/images/wheelchair_mob_handle.jpg)," even, in a similar way many with manual chairs remove the handles in the back. While I don't discount the idea this, or similar inventions, could help *some* people, it's unlikely to be widely accepted unless something dire happens to our freedom of choice. It's all Pretty much about me wanting to be in control of me. Like others have said limited autonomy, never ever give up any autonomy you don't have to. Also these chairs are complicated enough and the more complex the more things that will break or need repairs.  Nope. Because I want to be in control of my own mobility and where I am to graphically. Not something else. Like if you had too many things on your lap to navigate carefully, so you'd make one big trip on autopilot mode? Or you'd make two trips, the first on regular mode and the second on autopilot mode? Would you still feel like such a wheelchair would reduce your autonomy if it had features that let you override its controls? For instance, if you had to cross a really crowded auditorium, you would communicate this intent to the system. If you saw someone that you know, you could intervene and stop this action. Though you wouldn't be controlling the wheelchair every step of the way, you would still have the ultimate say in what its goal is.   I see what you're saying about not wanting to give up autonomy. 

I guess I'm asking what it means for you to be in control of yourself. Even in a manual wheelchair, you know you want to "accelerate forward" so you apply some force to your wheel to make it accelerate forward -- you feel sufficiently in control even though you're not managing every little mechanical part of the wheelchair. It doesn't matter how it works on a lower level because your goal of "accelerate forward" is being met. But what if your goal was a little bigger, like "move forward 2 feet" or "move out my dog's way" or "go to the end of the block" or "go to my house".  At which point would you feel uncomfortable letting your wheelchair handle the finer details? What kinds of things would you want to explicitly authorize? One trip on autopilot. According to my boyfriend, he never sees me make more than one trip anyway, but I guess autopilot would help make it easier regardless. I would if I had no other choice, but not if I had any other means of doing it by myself. It would have to have a way to *immediately* shut down, and a way to control it somehow. I'm in my own powerchair for most things, so not having that, for me, is creating somewhat of a barrier in my thinking; the answer might very well be different for those who don't rely on it so much, or can't reliably operate their chair independently. I can imagine, say, someone who has severe muscle spasms/tremors choosing this option, but not someone with muscle control.

Another problem that came into my mind, it's that the program and such would likely not factor in anything personal. Many of us rely on, say, proper positioning of the chair to transfer, or make a judgement on when/where to be less (or more, if you're that type) "intrusive." There's a lot of unconscious thinking that goes into me driving my chair, like where I take up space and predicting how others are moving around me and how I can most effectively communicate and guessing how far something is away from me, that anything autonomous would likely make into a hindrance. I don't like my chair away from me because that means I can't transfer or "walk" away, so anything like that is out completely ("wheelchair, go charge" would be a strict no, unless it engages something rather than moves something). 

But FWIW, I am open to automating things I can't do, or can't afford to do, which makes me (personally) interested in self-driving cars. To my thinking, it's unlikely I'll ever afford a modified car, so relying on a machine over a human doesn't matter much to me. But you don't often stop to have a chat or try to position yourself *just right* in a car (I mean, obvious exceptions like parking) so it feels less like an intrusion. But an automated wheelchair is like asking someone who walks, "would you like puppet strings attached to each of your limbs and be controlled? Even for a little bit?" As absurd as it sounds, it still sounds unpleasant!  personally, the way the controls are now **IS** my limit. you have to understand that I consider my chair part of my body.. so look at it like this:

Would you be ok with your body being moved by some autonomous a.i.? would you be comfortable even knowing that something external to you could and would make decisions about where and how you move, and then move you?

I don't think you're getting it. I am uncomfortable with a piece of equipment (my body) handling ***ANY*** of the finer details. I don't want to explicitly authorize anything! I want to **DO** IT MYSELF.
 Interesting points, thanks! Especially the part about factoring in personal preferences and idiosyncrasies. What if, hypothetically, your wheelchair system could do a pretty good job of doing this factoring? Maybe it could pick up on your patterns of behavior and mimic it to the point where you "agree" with that it does like 99%  of the time. Personally, if I had limb puppet strings that were smart enough to mimic my behavior, I'd go for it. Especially on those tired morning walks to school when I just want to turn my brain off and not worry about bumping into people, but also don't want to draw attention to myself for having an unnatural "robotic" walk. 
Idk, maybe there's about the puppet string leg analogy that doesn't "work the same way" with a wheelchair.

If something like this existed, would you consider using it? Or are there behaviors of yours that you think an autonomous wheelchair couldn't possibly pick up on/replicate. Or maybe the idea might just be too disconcerting/problematic for you in a way that I'm not thinking of?
