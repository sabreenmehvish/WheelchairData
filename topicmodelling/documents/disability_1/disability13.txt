For once, I felt normal I had a stroke when I was very young. Because of this, I have always felt extremely conscious about my right side, such as my arm always being bent and waking with a limp. Just last weekend, my husband and I took a vacation to my dad's house to participate in his city's Piratefest. That was the first time ever that I felt normal and unjudged. Waking with a limp and an arm that can't work? That's the life of a pirate! Believe me, we'll be going to Piratefest every year now!  That's awesome! I used my wheelchair as part of my costume and went as Barbara Gordon/Oracle to a comic Con a few years ago. Everyone loved it and honestly it made me feel really sexy having so many people compliment me, taking my picture, etc. Not to mention is was awesome cosplaying a character who's been such a source of inspiration and strength to me! Such a great way to look at things! Hahaha That is great! I am so happy for you!! That's adorable :) congrats! Also a pirate themed festival sounds like a blast.
