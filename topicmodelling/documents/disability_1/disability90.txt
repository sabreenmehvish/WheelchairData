[request] Websites for Wheelchair clothing Hey everybody, Summer is upon us. I was hoping someone who uses a wheelchair could point me towards an accessible clothing website or a specific go to brand of clothes. I’m specifically looking for shorts. I am 29-year-old male quadriplegic. 

The problem is I get significantly fatter when I sit in my wheelchair vs When I’m lying down. So end up swimming in some pairs of shorts (34”ish laying down and 38” when I’m in my chair)

I’ve got a bunch of athletic gym shorts made by under armor, they are good for every day stuff, but I’m looking for something dressier..

Thanks in advance, happy wheeling http://www.rollitex.co.uk/

 For women I’d recommend using maternity jeans and leggings. There perfect for sitting down with the elastic waist but the legs are still the perfect size.  This is an interesting list that I will have to check out. A word of warning – that is, my personal experience – the other day I was trying to order a wheelchair poncho from Adaptions by Adrian. I had heard/read that they came highly recommended. Unfortunately, the orders for the wheelchair poncho never went through. As it would not let me select the submit button to process my payment details.

I tried 4 separate credit cards. None of them worked. So, ultimately, I went with a wheelchair rain poncho that I found on Amazon. I have not had the opportunity to test drive it, so to speak.

I like the idea of supporting businesses like this, but if it is not functionally possible, that's a problem.
