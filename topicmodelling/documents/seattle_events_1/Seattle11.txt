 Looking for recommendations of places to eat for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not looking for high-end prix fixe, or even necessarily thanksgiving food. Something causal and tasty is great, not sure what will be open that day. Around pikes market area.  Anyone know about regular Spanish or Portuguese meetup/conversation groups in Seattle? Thanks! [November 24th: Movie Night @ Ballard's Substation - Guitar Wolf's Wild Zero (JP Zombie Alien Rock 'n' Roll Love Story)](https://www.facebook.com/events/2199051177004102/) Any suggestions for things to do on Nov22n'd and Nov 23r'd ?   Does anyone have a working discord link for a pokemon go group in seattle downtown or capital hill? Thank you my friend! There are a [few listed here](https://seattle.eater.com/maps/restaurants-open-thanksgiving-seattle-turkey) (and it's not "Pike's" market, its the Pike Place Market). Of those I've tried RN74 (it was very good), Wild Ginger (also delish) and Daniel's Broiler (not bad). Watch football. Eat.

There are also parks and hikes, though according to the forecast Thursday is supposed to be rainy and cold. following Thank you!! Well as someone who made Thanksgiving reservations last week you'd better nail down something **NOW** if you want a hope of finding dinner on Thanksgiving.

Sadly most of the restaurants on Eater's list were already fully booked as of last Thursday. Exceptions include Lost Lake and 13 Coins. There are some other no-reservations places with Thanksgiving dinners such as the 5 Point.

The Stranger has a good list: https://www.thestranger.com/things-to-do/2018/11/15/35637562/your-ultimate-guide-to-where-to-eat-out-for-thanksgiving-2018-in-seattle

Also look at Opentable for some additional fancy options and places in the suburbs: https://www.opentable.com/promo.aspx?m=2&ref=551&pid=1
