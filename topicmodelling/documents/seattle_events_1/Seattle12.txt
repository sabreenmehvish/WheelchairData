Green Lake - things to do this weekend? I'll be in Green Lake this weekend and am looking for things to do. Any craft fairs/holiday bazaars, food festivals, farmers markets, music events, or such that are going on? Are there any events calendars I should take a look at? 

Also, any restaurant recommendations for the area? I'll be with an omnivore and a vegan, so all suggestions are welcome. 

Thanks! If only there were an easy way to find [event calendars ](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Seattle+event+calendar) on the internet... Phinney Ridge is celebrating the 38th winter festival. Local art, live entertainment, food, and wine and beer. At the historic Phinney Neighborhood Association. All the money raised goes to a good cause and it's a lot of fun.  The Urban Craft Uprising craft fair is happening at Seattle Center this weekend, it’s like Etsy in person. Also Araya’s Place for vegan Thai food  I'm a big fan of Google and helping myself. I've actually already pulled up a few calendars, but I reached out to the smartass reddit community because they know best. :) I'd rather get a local's perspective than only find out about events that have paid advertising. Thank you for the suggestion! Thank you! I didn't see that online anywhere. You can try Facebook events, they usually list events based on geographic location. I’m sure Greenlake has a neighborhood FB page
