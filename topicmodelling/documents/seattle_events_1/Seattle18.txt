 Hi all, looking for an overnight parking recommendation near Pike Place / The Westin for a few days. Saturday is the 8th annual Halloween Pub Crawl downtown! Join 1,000+ of us all day and night! [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/halloween-pub-crawl-2018-tickets-48619575459](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/halloween-pub-crawl-2018-tickets-48619575459) I’m visiting a friend in Fremont the weekend of  oct 27-28. Does anyone have recs for spooky/fun Halloween events? I'm looking to move to Seattle in six weeks. Are there any areas I should avoid looking for an apartment in?

I'm looking for a 1BR, price range $1.5k to $2,5k a month, and reliable and fast Internet.

Any tips or resources you'd recommend for looking for apartments in Seattle? Hi! I’m visiting for my wife next week, flying in Friday and flying back Wednesday. We wanted to do some outdoors activities like nearby hikes and also see downtown. Any recommendations or things to watch out for/skip? We’ve never been to the area.  hey guys..hockey fan dropping in from Vegas with an idea for you  for your NHL team

the Thunder

do it...you've more than earned it Couple of Texans coming to Seattle for the first time in November. What kind of jackets or apparel are we gonna need? I know that sounds like a silly question but I’m really not sure what to expect. Any bars in Seattle showing the Beto O'Rourke/Ted Cruz Texas debate tonight? No event to really share, but just wanted to say that all the pictures of fall foliage in Seattle has made *really* miss this city. I lived here for six years, from 2011-2017. Moved away to the midwest for work and while I'm happy where I am now, seeing these recent pictures caused a wave of memories to come flooding back :'( General question: I’m attending a concert in Tacoma on a Sunday night at TacomaDome. What are my public transportation options besides Uber? It looks as if any trains aren’t running on Sunday/night. Staying in Belltown  Free ticket to Au/Ra, Tove Stryke @ Tractor Tavern in Ballard  tonight 10/21. PM me. Hello all! My wife and I will be visiting seattle for a week in November and I was hoping someone can answer these questions.

What time does the sun usually go down in November? I'm thinking about heading up the space needle when we visit and would like to get some shots of Seattle's view in the day and then at night. We plan on reserving dinner at the restaurant inside the space needle.

We plan on biking while we visit, can anyone recommend a nice trail to ride? I've done some searching and I was looking at lake Washington. 

Thanks guys! Any advice would be appreciated! ELI5 why should sugary drinks be taxed more than other drinks? What sort of neighborhood vibe are you looking for? I live near mercer and broadway in an older building but the rent is your base price. Pretty sure we still have units open. DM me if your interested.  Pike Place market is a must. I generally recommend going on a weekday in the morning before the crowds arrive, but when ever you decide to go, make sure you're hungry when you arrive. I also recommend Discovery Park and its easy, 3-mile loop trail, especially if the weather stays as nice as it is right now. The Olympic Sculpture Park is also worth checking out. I've also heard good things about the Seattle Underground tour, though I haven't done it myself.  

Definitely take some time to just wander around some of Seattle's neighborhhods--they each have their character. But keep in mind that our streets are terribly laid out, very hilly, and quite congested, so getting from point A to boint B is going to take you longer than you think it should based on the distance. What looks like a 5 minute trip on paper is probably more like 15-20 at best and up to an hour at worst. 

There are a TON of day hikes near Seattle, too many to list here.  I recommend checking out the WA Trails Association (www.wta.org) for info on hiking. Bear in mind that weekend crowds are a real thing, so leave early (like no later than 6 or 7 on a Saturday) and be prepared to struggle to find parking.  Rattle Snake! I suppose it's about as appropriate as the *Golden Knights* Light jacket, its pretty nice right now. I'm visiting from California and I've been walking around in just a t shirt all day. Perfect weather, probably gonna be a bit nippy after sunset though.

Edit: I just realized youre asking about next month, nevermind haha Waterproof jackets are best. Dress in layers: a sweater over a shirt and gloves and a scarf are nice too for mornings and evenings.  At night you'll need a proper hoodie / windbreaker and you'll probably still be cold. Especially downtown, the winds can get preeetty brittle To pay for the healthcare costs that coincide with fat, poor people that buy the stuff because its cheap. Same way they tax the shit out of cigarettes. Not that i think it works, thats usually the reasoning behind it though. I'm not totally sure. I just want something close to work with plenty of shit to do. My work would be around 8th Avenue. Is this a... what day is this? Thanks for the heads up on the weekend crowds. We didn’t really think of that.  We planned to do hiking Saturday and Sunday and downtown Monday and Tuesday before returning. Thanks for the tips.  That doesn’t really make sense when we don’t have fully funded state medical though. That’s seriously the justification for it? Capitol Hill is probably what you’re looking for, if you’re looking for the social hub type of area Not trying to justify it, it's just the usual argument.
