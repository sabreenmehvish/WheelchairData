Is there a site for buying tickets to sold out events? Hello Seattle folks! I'm visiting my brother from Ireland, and I'm trying to get tickets to "A Very Die Hard Christmas" this weekend. The event appears sold out, but I'm wondering if there is a site for reselling tickets. I don't mean touts, but a site for people who can no longer go to the events. 
Or any other tips on how I can get tickets to this event? Stubhub Call the box office directly and ask IMO. I've gotten tickets to sold out shows like this by dealing with the box office of the venue directly (and very politely), but it seems to be getting less common that venues even have a box office staff, unfortunately.
