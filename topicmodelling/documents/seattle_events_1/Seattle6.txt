&#x200B; Hello Seattleites! I’ll be visiting your city for work next week, and I will have a free day on Saturday. I was wondering if you could recommend me something outdoorsy to do in the area (renting a car is not a problem). I like hiking and cycling, although I obviously won’t have my bicycle with me, so that would have to be rented. 

1. Is there any good hiking trails that don’t require advanced gear for the current season? I’ll have warm clothing and decent shoes with me, but no snow gear. 
2. Are there any nice bike trails that are doable right now?

I’m decently fit so intermediate hikes wouldn’t be a problem.  This Saturday night come check out Boom Bap—it's a hip hop improv show at Csz Seattle Theater. There's some really incredible improvising MCs in this city, watch us flex some skills while bringing the laughs.

Come to Ada's Technical Books for a discussion with Scott L. Montgomery about the regulatory changes and evidence about human radiation dose.

Is this a Trump conspiracy or can you thank Obama for the EPA change in protocols?

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tis-the-season-free-card-making-holiday-drive-tickets-53147744334 Check conditions on Washington Trail Association’s website. I know Snow Lake and Mt. Si are popular lower intermediate hikes but likely are treacherous, crampon-demanding perhaps at this point in December. Everything in the I-90 corridor region will be easiest to access from Seattle proper. I have some easy-intermediate suggestions depending on your definition of intermediate, sorry I can’t help more. 

As for biking trails - mountain biking I’m guessing? Grand Ridge for XC, South Tiger for all mountain (I think parking lot is still open...? Check Evergreen MTB Alliance website for conditions).
