LIME Cars are here!  There's already one hanging upside-down in a tree on my street. Omg I wonder how many of these things are going to get boosted and sent to Central America.  I saw one yesterday, but it wasn't showing on the app; has anyone been able to rent one? Was that an issue with the smart cars? Not sure TBH. I'm just thinking it wouldn't be hard to drive them to a designated location, log out, and then have someone carry them off. The app probably can't tell you just parked it on a trailer, car carrier, or shipping container. Especially the shipping container because any tracking on the car can be wiped out by outfitting the container to block it. Put ten of those cars in a container in one night and you're off to the races. I mean, a normal person couldn't do it but I'm certain an organized crew could. On a smaller scale, you could drive one to an alley and strip it out of sight. No one would look at one of these things twice because there's no personal sense of ownership link to them. Cops can't profile anyone in them because anyone has the ability to access them.  Easy there Memphis. Well if its not being done to the $40K+ car2go mercedes, then the $12K fiat should be safe Yeah because criminals don't exist. What was I thinking.  Considering this has never been a problem with any of the current ride shares, your concern seems more like fear mongering or hollywood dramatization.  I am not concerned, merely curious. I couldnâ€™t care any less about what goes on in the unimaginative mind you possess however.  Easy there sailor. You left your jerkface on by accident
