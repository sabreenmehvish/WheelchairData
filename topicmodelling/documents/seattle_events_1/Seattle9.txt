Looking for lighting events or places with holiday lights I'm trying to plan a date for my SO and we both really wanna go see some holiday lights.  Only problem is we both have really garbage schedules, so that makes it really difficult to find events to go to.  Our best days are the 5th, the 10th, and the 30th, but we can make a few other days work.  

What would be easiest is just a place that's open all month long since a lot of the events I've seen repeating over multiple days are still restricted by our available days.

We also don't mind traveling out of the seattle area if there are other great lights elsewhere.  Zoo Lights at Woodland Park Zoo runs for like a month, try that.

The whole night made for one of the best dates that my wife and I had been on in all of the year.
