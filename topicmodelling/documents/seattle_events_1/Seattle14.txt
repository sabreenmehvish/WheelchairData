 I know y'all love transplants, but you're getting at least one more of them. I officially accepted an offer at Boeing in Everett, probably starting late January. I can't wait to not see the sun for 4 months! Bought tickets to see the rolling stones in May. Anyone also going? Also, anyone have any good ideas about places to stay/air bnbs near century link field?  Visiting friends in a couple of days, I checked the weather and it says its gonna be raining.

How accurate is that? And I'm gonna assume it's gonna be a bad time to check out the space needle with the clouds? I might visit in October for a wedding. We will also use this trip as a family vacation since we have never had one. What are your suggestions for a family of 5. Kids ages are 14, 13 and 3.

Please include price range with your suggestion so I have some idea how much we would spend. Thanks Seattle!  Itâ€™ll rain and be cloudy.  I suggest going up the Space Needle. It will cost a substantial amount.
