Petition filed for potential referendum against $135 million in tax funds for Mariners ballpark  The public owns the building! This is madness... At this point, $135M (or even $180M) will be a bargain compared to lost tax revenue and associated costs to either mothball or tear down Safeco Field if the Mariners moved. Do these so called citizens who oppose spending this 135m have any idea how much money is made each night there is a ball game by local businesses? Do they know how many jobs, especially non skilled entry level jobs this stadium provides? Do they know each of the two Pearl Jam (not Mariners) concerts last summer almost set single event records for revenue generated? Do they know how much money in taxes is made off that stadium each year? Do they know local charities run concession stands and booths at the events? Do they even know who owns the stadium http://www.ballpark.org ? 135m to keep a tourist attraction, landmark and cash cow up to date is nothing.  The city is already spending over 200M a year on the homeless, do these people really think that another 5M a year is going to solve the problem? What does any of it have to do with income equality other than the people who own the team have more money than these people complaining about them?  Maybe the public shouldn't own it. Let's put that up for a vote. I think we're getting somewhere. The public isn't asking to upgrade it, the team is.  Since they're the ones who want the upgrade, why should we be on the hook?

That's like going to my apartment manager and saying "GO GET THE PUBLIC TO BUY ME A PATIO OTHERWISE I MOVE!"

And people who love sports more than sense see no reason to disagree. Is this something you can cite or does it just sound good saying?

Why should we subsidize this private business so? Baseball is not a public service. No. How much tax does King County receive each night there is a ball game from local businesses?

How many full time jobs does taxpayer money directly create due to Safeco Field?

Do taxpayers see a benefit from single event records that are set at Safeco Field? How much tax is received by King County at each record setting event over the past 4 years?

Please provide a list of charities that run concession stands or booths at events that occur at Safeco Field. Please also break this down by event date (as the IRS does care about such activities at this level.)

Thanks! We don’t know about these things that would educate us to make informed decisions as to whether us 2 million “so called citizens” of King County should have an opinion either way on these topics. But it sounds like you do, as you’ve identified them precisely. Please enlighten us and answer your own questions.  Increase ticket costs.

Solved. Well. Not really. It would be like a tenant going to a landlord and saying “hey we’d like to make these improvements to a building you own, would you mind paying for some of the capital costs?” 

Which, you’ll note, is literally exactly what happened. In the case of Safeco the landlord is the taxpayer ultimately, sure, but your example is pretty far off. 

I’m not sure if you’re being intentionally misleading or you don’t understand either arrangement.  It would be more akin to the roof is going to leak if you don't replace it soon.  Those dollars are for maintaining the building, not adding racing stripes. Among other things, the roof needs to be resealed, and you can't pick this stuff up at Home Depot. Also, this is over 20 years, not all at once. Yes, it is something I can cite.

The baseball team signed a lease to rent the stadium. Akin to when something fails at an apartment and we ask the owner/landlord to fix something, or they do preventative maintenance on their own. They provided two jobs. They made tax off 7$ total sales in 2017 for the 2.1m+ attendee's of Mariner games. All 2.1m Mariner fans rode their bikes to the games. No one paid for parking. All 2.1m fans are in keto too. No one bought stadium food and they all refilled their own water bottles at drinking fountains. The sell out concerts, graduations and other special events where pretty much the same story. This doesn't exist either https://seattlestadiumjobs.com/fundraising-npo/

You got me. How will I ever recover?  Instead of whining to that guy, why don't you get up off of your fat whiny ass and go do some fucking research on all of the questions that you've listed above. 
 Based on data from the 2016 season we where the 8th most expensive average ticket price in the mlb. According to some calculations once you ad in parking and basic concessions we are anywhere from the 2-4 most expensive stadium to have a ballpark experience at. Raising the price on a family who wants to go to a ball game doesn't sound good to me.  I see a billion dollar org trying to get taxpayers to fund upgrades to their field.  Dress it up how you like, if they want the park they can buy the park, but in this day and age, the public deserves a vote on it.  The money's clearly being taken from other things that drive real value for the county. I've lived in apartments for years and the response to that from every landlord I've ever had would be to fuck off. Why can't we do the same? The Seattle Mariners are a $1.4 billion organization.  We have a housing crisis.   Sorry man, I think the owners can pay for the upgrades.  > Yes, it is something I can cite.

I'm waiting. I'd like to see a cost-benefit analysis, as well as demonstrable value to the community above simply taxes.

They only pay $2million a year for rent. How is this a beneficial relation to the landlord to run a deficit for a private company?

A sports team being homeless is the least of my concerns, sorry. I’m confused, are you employed part-time by the field, are you a lobbyist for the team/field operator, or are you paid by said lobbyist? I want to help but I think you might just be a troll.  You don’t have answers either? Who is fat again?

I expect lobbyists and folks running against the incumbent King County elected officials to provide us citations ahead of the election. Obviously I don’t expect it from fat redditors like you and the parent post.  You act like it's a public service, as if everyone loves and needs baseball just as much as you. There's problems to prioritize, and this theoretical family just ain't one. It's a business.

Lower the salary of the millionaires playing. No money is being taken from anything. This money has always been earmarked for the field, since the tax was first charged. I’m not necessarily disagreeing, just pointing out your example of what this “would be like” is both inaccurate and disingenuous. You likened it to your private landlord asking for public money for a private building. In reality it’s a private company asking for public money for what is technically (not arguing the right or wrong there) a public building. 
 Why do you hate America? /s Because it’s not an apartment. It’s much more similar to a commercial lease. If you know anything about commercial leases you’d understand the owner is almost invariably responsible for upkeep of the building, and that requests like this aren’t uncommon. 
 They are!

Don't you even educate yourself on what deal is? It's $135 million of your money. You should really understand how it's being spent and what you are getting in return.

The county is paying $135 million for necessary upkeep on a 18 year old facility. Things like a new roof membrane and HVAC system. Irrespective of the financial success of the current tenant, these are maintenance costs that were foreseen when they built the thing and necessary for ANY tenant to occupy the structure.

In return the successful M's organization has agreed to put in $650 million, mostly, for upgrades and, some, into the county coffers for general use. Just because the organization is successful, doesn't change the fact that the county owns the building, and is responsible for maintaining it. Besides that, having the Mariners in Seattle generates far more money than that for the city, county, and all businesses around the stadium.

As for the housing crisis, the government, and not private business, has a duty to fi. That problem. Throwing more money at it, without accountability, is a waste.  The next time you want numbers, ask for them and not just the ability to cite them.

If you want a full cost benefit analysis, go ask King County.  I could say Safeco Field (which I hate was built) generates trillions of dollars a year and you would shit on it anyway.

If you’re genuinely interested in the numbers, use the Googles and search for the study the Mariners commissioned.  Even the most ardent of baseball fans would say the study is biased and some of the numbers are, at best, comical.  

Still, even if you cut all of the numbers in half, there is financial benefit to maintaining Safeco Field.

I didn’t vote for the stadium in the 90s, but here it is.  King County is the landlord, and at this point it would do more damage to the economy of the region than simply mothballing or demolishing. I am not employed by any entity involved with the Mariners, city or county. I'm just a guy who knows a person who is employed at the stadium and has detailed first hand knowledge of financial information. I also shitpost. A lot.  No, I think it's called a economy.  The Mariners don't own the building and are not the only people who have events in the building. The salary's of the Mariners employees, the musical performers, the attendees of graduations, the elves at this years winter wonderland at the park, etc have nothing to do with the county paying for basic and reasonable maintenance and upgrades to keep the building up to date.  Why?
Shrug. I simply see it as an enormous waste of resources for little to no return for the species.  Imagine a world free of silly payouts for playing - everyone knows this - *games*, where instead we rewarded nurses, teachers, emergency crews, researchers and firefighters the way we reward a man who can hold a ball and sustain multiple concussions.  imagine a 'public defender' award where we showed respect for those people who put their efforts into making life better for everyone, and that person got a bmw and didn't have to think about their debt for a picosecond.

*Humanity* needs mvps.  It doesn't need more pointless contests where we dangle a tiny sliver of hope to a vanishingly small population of potential athletes to trade their bodies for a few minutes of NCAA or pro entertainment.  And that's the lucky ones, most never get that chance.

Just seems like a waste.  Sure, play for fun, sure, compete if you want to, by all means, but the amount of money and time wasted on this stuff is staggering, and not helping the species one iota. I know multiple people with commercial licenses and they're the ones paying for the improvements, not the landlord. >...is a waste.

You just helped me decide on my vote, but not as you intended.

You act like this building actually produces any meaningful goods or services, as if nothing else could fill this hole.

I can't give a fuck about a baseball team's business any less. Well I don’t think any of us wants to take anyone’s jobs away, especially here in Seattle, but it does seem that the principal-agent problem has led us to this point. I don’t know what the solution is in our current political climate but I do think we need to transcend government-funded servitude. 

I only hope our next generation of local elected officials can educate the public better on these matters and justify the public good value generated by taxpayer dollars and improve efficiency. Unlike the federal government, we can’t just print money and hope for “trickle-down” economics to happen.  A sports based economy? Hmmmm... It's a bad business plan then.

The government should not be part of a business. /s denotes sarcasm.

I couldn't agree with you more. [It's a purposeful distraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGxUZcyVMXM), from the shouts of "Maximus! Maxismus" to "Jonathan! Jonathan!"  Sorry your friends are shitty at negotiating, I guess.  If "this building" didn't create tax revenue for the city and county, it wouldn't exist. That is why it was constructed, even after citizens voted against it, with taxpayer dollars. It is occupied by a tenant that creates community for all citizens of our city, county, state, and region, and beyond. That is the meaningful service it provides. If you do not get the civic benefits of an organization that brings people together, that is on you I agree that no one wants to take anyone's job away, but too many jobs and too few houses is actually the problem right now in Seattle. And you can't afford to live in Seattle with that kind of job anyways, so... This is Seattle, it's more of a heroin, coffee and dildo based economy.  Well now we are getting down to brass tacks. With my libertarian priors I could ramble on about that topic a good bit.  It creates tax dollars, which allow us to buy stadium for private business, so we can make more tax dollars, and on.

I haven't yet heard of a sports based economy.
 Go back to /r/T_D 😁

I'd rather pay taxes to help make life better for everyone.

Or to buy bombs.. 😀 If it generates fans, it generates income, and a high tide floats all boats. Welcome to capitalism. If you don't think the Mariners prop up the businesses around the field, pop in to any bars nearby and ask them the difference between game nights and not Solid rubutle, very well thought out and well articulated.  I am with you on the taxes in terms of a humanitarian aspect. That's why I support the county owning and maintaining the building. The city is far better of with it than without it when you take into account tax revenue and entry level jobs created.  Free enterprise requires a demand. You want to "generate fans". That's not the governments business, never was.

Attendance for all MLB games are dropping steadily. Tastes change. It was universally loved at one point, but not anymore. Cultures grow up , just like people, and stop playing with balls.

At some point in any failing industry the government becomes their one and only cash cow, long after they stopped being viable. That's our failures in capitalism and democracy.
 >rubutle

Did you mean *rebuttal*?

UN_laughing.wav If they were full time jobs, I'd think similar to you. But they're not. How will I ever recover?  A lot of the lower level folks work over at century Link as well. If you show up and do your job you get lots of opportunities to work other events. I am also including the parking lot folks, street vendors, sourounding business, etc. 

Also, if I am being completely honest, a certain amount of the folks employed at the stadium face what you could call unique challenges in life. Some of them probably couldn't hold down a regular full time job.  Education. Quite possibly.

But it comes down to $135m, it's quite a job program.

That could go a long way to help those hundreds of people.

Knock the building down. Use the money for that.

There are many YouTube videos out there pointing out that sports stadiums should not use tax payer money. 

https://youtu.be/e22yH5hUQ_A

https://youtu.be/xcwJt4bcnXs

Etc.

They should all be private. 

People in this state will actually vote for stadiums and yet vote against health care and education.

 How is that going to deafeat my mild dyslexia and the auto correct feature on my phone that somehow gets turned back on after every update?  135m is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. Hate to break it to ya but that much money gets wasted funding studies to figure out how to spend more money, which in a lot of cases never gets spent or gets poorly spent even after the studies.
