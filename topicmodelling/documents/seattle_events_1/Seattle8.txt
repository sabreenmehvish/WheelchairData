 This Saturday 12/15 1PM-4PM, Free Holiday Event in Mineral Springs Park https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tis-the-season-free-card-making-holiday-drive-tickets-53147744334 # 3rd Annual Tiny Art Walk - Capitol Hill 

Thursday, December 13th, 6-9 p.m. 

at The Summit, 400 E Pike St, Seattle

Join us for our 3rd annual Tiny Art Pop Up Show! This evening will showcase the tiny works of local artists. As many are giving gifts this time of year, all art is small in size and affordable to accommodate small apartments and small budgets! 

Free holiday refreshments. Affordable parking in the garage attached. Buses 10, 11, 43 and 49 stop close to the venue. It's quite funny actually, because all of these things receive immediate downvotes from the r/Seattle community.
