University of Washington College Republicans Threaten Lawsuit After Bar Declines to Host Pro-Kavanaugh ‘Beers 4 Brett’ Party  Locking this thread since the comments have become terribly off-topic.

Please don't feed the trolls, and please remember to be nice to each other. Can't they just play devil's triangle and other drinking games at home? Apparently the free market is only allowed to discriminate against the gay community.  >Shultzy’s officials appear to have stopped commenting–but appear to have folded in the face of the legal threat. At the planned time, 15 members of the College Republicans showed up at the bar anyway for drinks. They were allowed to purchase their booze and congregate without incident. What sad little snowflakes. republicans: totally cool with businesses discriminating based on race and sexual orientation but god forbid someone does it back to them.... Some classic gop rights for me but not for thee entitled bullshit. Private sector, should be able to decline to host whatever event. You don't have to go to this establishment.

Perhaps call the event Gay Beers 4 Brett? That will stir up some complex drama. No one can beat Republicans for hypocrisy.  Baby incels throw fit. No film at 11. Dang, was hoping Shultzy's wouldn't back down on that one. I get taking the easy road though.  I thought a private business was allowed the right to refuse service to anyone as long as it wasn't based on race or gender and shit like that? 

How the fuck is being a Republican special besides being "special?" Lol, only 15 people showed? Nice.  What’s wrong with showing out to a business?  I’m not saying do anything mean to them, but maybe watching sports while they are doing their meeting would make it less comfortable for them.  Honestly a sports bar is not a great spot for a political meeting This is wrong. They're a private business and should be able to serve and not serve who ever they'd like. snowflakes are TRIGGERED S-N-O-W-F-L-A-K-E-S The definition of hypocrites, that establishment has the right to do that, take your business elsewhere and don't get so offended.  Womp Womp Can we find out the date and time and make the place extra packed before they arrive? They should totally take the money and host the event. And also disassemble their lines for cleaning that day. ....you people know you are afforded the same protections under the law?

It's absolutely ridiculous that you guys want people to be segregated by political opinions. The echo chamber in Seattle is alive and well. I have a feel you all will still be shocked come Trump’s re-election Well, blame Seattle, they have this:

>[Seattle’s illegal discrimination ordinance](http://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/civil-rights) is extremely atypical in that it defines “political ideology” as a protected class along the same lines as a person or group’s immutable characteristics like gender identity, sex, color, national origin and race. 

&#x200B;

Also the bar, I would agree, is in the clear:

&#x200B;

>“They’re free to request all they like. If the group says too bad, ‘You’re required to admit us,’ and the bar says, ‘Oh no, you cannot come in,’ then at least potentially this group could have a claim,” Needle noted. But if the bar was consistently opposed to all political events? Then they’d be in the clear.  

&#x200B; No you just have to claim that your relgion prevents you from serving republicans then you are fine.  But they couldn't, they got shut down. I think that's the double standard they're suing for. what assholes.  its entitlement like this and knowing the next generation of conservatives are going to be even worse than todays conservatives that makes me feel like the next civil war is inevitable.   They should commiserate over some cake, I know just who they could call: http://masterpiececakes.com For anyone who wonders if this is true. I can say with 100% certainty it is false.

It is upsetting that people believe this about conservatives. [removed] Unless someone wants to foot their legal bill, they got nothing to gain and everything to lose. Plus they didnt really even say the Republicans couldn't party there, they  just asked nicely i'm sure the staff game them a great experience. Seattle has a statute that includes political affiliation in this group Well they are special needs. So, no coloreds allowed. Haven't really thought this through have you? You’re a pleasant person aren’t you? Why is old adage “treat others how you would like to be treated” not used anymore?  Why? They are opinions. This isn't limiting people based on race or sexual orientation or place of birth or anything else they don't control.

It's entirely based on their own awful choices. These are bad people. They deserve nothing.  The bar does not have to host the event- that is not segregation, Sir Snowflake. He won't be re-elected if everyone actually votes next time. I didn’t know being a republican was considered a protected class now. Seems right to me. What part isn't right?  For anyone who wonders if this is false. I can say with 100% certainty it is true.

It is upsetting that people believe this from /u/KitsapDad.

 Who ever said Kavanugh was racist? 

We said he was accused of sexual assault which is true. He was accused. He was never exonerated either. He was just believed by Republicans. So you're cool with a guy who lies at his hearing under oath. Thats the guy you think should be a justice because hes on your team. My favorite part about bullshit like this is that it's clear that some right winger is doing fact mad-libs to try to come up with statements that sound damning to liberals. It's hilariously transparent and comes off as complete non-sequitur. What in the fuck does that have to do with anything? Lying under oath and making partisan rhetoric during confirmation makes you unqualified. Well he will help the systematic attacks on their right to vote, health care, and other basic freedoms but at least he gave them a job.
 The president is under federal investigation, why is he allowed to appoint someone who lies under oath to the highest court in the land? It's a joke and it's spitting on the very foundations of democracy and of this country. Republicans are the biggest hypocrites because they claim to love America and then turn around and shit on its core principles.

Also get your damn religion out of the supreme court How many rubles do you folks get hourly? Or is it a pay by the post sort of system? This has nothing to do with why people are upset about the appointment.  Paradox of intolerance.  Educate yourself Big money will step up, and it will go national, it’s happened before.  I did YR in college and resources were never a question.  I can't say I'm surprised but I do think that's really stupid.  I upvoted you, but it's not cool to make fun of the actual handicapped. Have you read the fucking news? Ask your rapist republican buddies. [removed] According to Seattle law, they do.  

[Seattle’s illegal discrimination ordinance](http://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/civil-rights) is extremely atypical in that it defines “political ideology” as a protected class along the same lines as a person or group’s immutable characteristics like gender identity, sex, color, national origin and race.  Only in the city of Seattle. 
> Seattle’s illegal discrimination ordinance is extremely atypical in that it defines “political ideology” as a protected class along the same lines as a person or group’s immutable characteristics like gender identity, sex, color, national origin and race.  Because you can't discriminate against people?

Seriously, this is the liberty the founding fathers wanted. We have wide spread protections for freedom of speech and right to assemble. We have the right to congregate free of oppression due to Seattle law, and you want to scale the law back because it protects people you disagree with? The part that validates people to hate another group of people. It is easy to hate people if you lump them together, point fingers and de-humanize them. That is what comments like the above do. They dont foster unity, they foster division, shut down conversation and lead to more distrust. It's not what we need. We need healthy dialogue and find common ground. Who said anyone ever said Kavanaugh racist? I’m pretty sure the walk away hashtag is a Russian troll thing. Probably can’t really reason with that.  [removed] Any proof he lied under oath? You obviously don't know the man, his rulings and his stances on issues in the least. What is my religion?

>Also get your damn religion out of the supreme court Yes true. If I had any I would **EVERYONE** needs to live by that motto.  No, never should that be a thing anyone does. Two wrongs don’t make a right.  I repeat - Not hosting an event is not an affront to an ideology. Denying service because political affiliation would be.

 No one is denying them entry based on political preference. Do they allow or have allowed other political groups to host in kind themed parties? If they do/did not then this doesn’t pass the first test and is not illegal.

> You are treated differently from others in a similar situation; and

> You are harmed by the treatment; and

> You are treated this way because of your membership in a protected class (i.e., race, gender, etc.) or

> Your request for a reasonable accommodation due to a disability is refused without a valid business reason.

The way the law is written is all of the first three points must be met, or the last point for it to be illegal.

In my opinion they would have merit for the second and third points, but the first point is going to destory this argument unless they can prove they had some sort of politcal themed event recently or have some policy that allows for it. You have the right to congregate all you want. The Bar doesn't have to host it. Yes. Because republicans are that bad. They deserve it.  You're implying that Kavanaugh's willingness to hire black law clerks is somehow exceptional. No one accused him of being racially biased in his choices.

The reasons behind the SCOTUS choosing primarily white male clerks has many institutional reasons and social reasons as well.

Everything from primarily white professors being the source of recommendations to minority students having a greater access to valuable opportunities (note the shout out to Obama turning down a clerk position).

 Look at the profiles for #walkaway. So many fakes and republicans.  I'm not. You clearly don't comprehend what I'm saying. [removed] The drunk lying rapist is a hardcore partisan conservative.  I was making a joke on Republicans too.... I don’t think so either, but if they are following that rule then that’s how they want to be treated.

 [deleted] You know I think I agree with you. That being said, would that same logic work if the bar didn't want to host an LGBT event?

My thought is yes, I just don't see it going over even close to as well in the court of public opinion. Did you even read the parent comment? 

 [Seattle’s illegal discrimination ordinance](http://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/civil-rights) is extremely atypical in that it defines “political ideology” as a protected class along the same lines as a person or group’s immutable characteristics like gender identity, sex, color, national origin and race.  [removed] Ah, so the proof is poof Yes. The proprietor does not have to formally host anything. The issue would be if they refused to serve said 15+ customers for being LGBTQ or w/e else. That is a different level of commitment from the establishment. Anyone can come in and be a customer and drink, whether or not the bar officially endorses an event or not is up to those who run the establishment. I make a clear distinction between turning down hosting an event vs denying service to people because of affiliation/orientation. There's a clear difference there as to the level of commitment the prospective customers are asking the proprietor to make.

If a bunch of fans of the recent SC appointee wanted to just go to a bar and celebrate without it being a real event, just to drink and be merry- I don't think they would be denied. But asking an owner of an establishment to HOST an actual event dedicated to such a thing - possibly alienating their normal clientele in the process - is something the owner has every right to refuse. Actively hosting sucha  thing implies endorsement on the owners behalf which could be incredibly dangerous for their establishment monetarilly moving forward. If a bunch of people happen to show up to drink there, that carries no level of commitment from the bar apart from serving customers as they always would. I think it is the correct call to turn down the request to host - it's not against the code, the bar never refused them service, they just refused them special attention for the service they would potentially recieve if they drank there. Not hosting an event is not an affront to an ideology. Denying service because political affiliation would be. [removed] [removed] Are you backpedaling?  [removed] Like in 2016,**huh fascist!** No - if a bunch of people of any affiliation or orientation or whatever went to a bar to drink that's fine - if those people asked a bar to formally host an event the proprietor is within their rights to refuse any official endorsement of a gathering.

It's the difference between 10 people who happen to be Neo-Nazis drinking at a bar and a bar saying "Hey local Neo-Nazis come here for a big ol' Neo-Nazi shindig" and actively pursuing that crowd. [removed] [removed] [removed] It wasn't an official event being organized with Schultzy's.

"In a statement posted to the “Beers 4 Brett” Facebook page, Shultzy’s management requested the group find somewhere else to hold their pro-Kavanaugh gathering."

Edit: You didn't read the article. Edit: got it, good link✌Damn. It wasn't a typo. You fucked that phrase up twice in a row.
