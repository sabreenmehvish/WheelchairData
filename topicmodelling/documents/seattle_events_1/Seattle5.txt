Looking for study buddy. I am learning python programming (from data science perspective), and I am finding it pretty hard to stay motivated while studying solo. In school, I got through by working in study groups and that worked very well for me. I am trying to spend 2 hrs in the evenings 2 or 3 days per week in a coffee shop and would love to have someone to study with - just to keep each other accountable and motivated to push past the learning struggles. Doesn't even need to be the same subject, as long as you have something you want to work on and don't want to feel like a lonely loser.

I am 30 year old male, with background in chemistry and biology (I am happy to be a resource in these subjects). 

Don't care for age or gender, I just like people :)  Consider Meetup.com Where is your usual study spot? I don't mind popping in from time to time. https://www.builtinseattle.com/event/puppy-programming-night/5796

That seems up your alley. Check out Built in Seattleâ€™s events page for more study/work/network opportunities in tech.  Thanks! Joined several Data Science meetups, will start hunting for motivated folks! That would be great! I've been enjoying working at Roy street cafe lately. Ill send you a PM, this week is a wash for me but I want to continue with the learning next week. Ill probably be there Tuesday evening.  Thanks for the link! Ive gone to some PuPPy events before and it was much heavier on the social side than studying/working. But maybe that's what I need to do in order to join a good work group...
