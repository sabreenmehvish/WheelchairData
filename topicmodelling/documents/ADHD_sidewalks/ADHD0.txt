ADD and icy sidewalks. Nope. "Not the time to be spacing out dumbass" - me after slipping after thinking how funny it would be if I slipped.

It was kinda funny Yup, but you kept a good sense of humour about it!  Glad you're not hurt, take care! YES, I HATE THIS!
I do this shit ALL THE TIME!

"Alright alpha, don't forget to grab the paper
Didn't I have a paper to write?
No but I did have homework in that class.
Better do it today so I can go to the car meet Saturday.
Saturday supposed to be nice to... Wait
I forgot the paper...."
  Please be careful on the ice. Last year a kid at my school broke his nose falling on an icy sidewalk. Crossing rarely used roads that are covered in ice, if campus safety hadn't purposefully been going slow around I could have been in trouble Protip from a Canadian: buy crampons. Having to concentrate on where I put my feet pisses me off, hahah.  I have issues with ADHD and stairs.  Usually while walking up, no big falls.  Just looking like a mess Have yet to slip on icy sidewalks, but have had many a collision with objects or people.  And here I thought I was alone with the stair thing....although for me it’s going down them that’s the big issue.  I think I move so much faster there that it isn’t an issue.
