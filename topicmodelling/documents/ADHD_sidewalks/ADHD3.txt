So frustrated with life So I just wanted to rant. Basically, I was just fired for the 3rd time. I had an awesome job, working for a parks department. I was outside, moving around, busting ass and was told I was one of the most motivated workers in the department. But I had 6 different “incidents “ that occurred in my 6 month probation period, so they decided to fire me. I got the work truck stuck in sand 2 times, I came in late one day (after buying a house and moving all weekend and unaware of how bad traffic would be) and was so exhausted that my supervisor offered me the chance to go home and rest, so of course I did. I cleaned a park grill and put coals that were not quite extinguished into the bag nearly causing a fire, but it didn’t! And the final straw was rushing to a meeting, and I was parked on a sidewalk in a park and I hit a water fountain with the truck. So those are my incidents, most of which are so silly to even count. But for the 3rd time in my life, I’ve been fired after being told how great of a worker I am, I just don’t pay enough attention. Over the pad two weeks since it happened, my attention is getting so much worse. I’ve almost gotten into 2 serious accidents. I am forgetting things all over the house. I’m feeling like such a mess. The best thing in the world has happened though. My girlfriend of two years has married me so that I could be on her insurance so I can get better help. We bought a house together and got a puppy together. I have these amazing things happen in my life, by I’m so mad at myself for getting fired again! It’s hard to explain to potential employers “yes, I’m capable. I’m hardworking. Yes I was fired three times, but those were learning mistakes about what not to do in the next job” and most of the time there’s people who are a lot more capable who also applied without the issues who get the job. I just feel lost. Any one else out there can relate?
