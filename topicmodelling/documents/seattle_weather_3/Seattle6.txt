Just wait! My coworkers when I've complained about the sun, 

"It might be sunny now but wait til November it's gonna really start raining and you're gonna wish you'd see the sun more! Hahaha!"

"It might be sunny now but wait til December it's gonna really start raining and you're gonna wish you'd see the sun more! Hahaha!"

Still waiting for those weeks of endless rain Seattle 🙄 Go back to where ever you came from and take this mentality with you  WTF are you on about OP?

It's literally monsoon-style raining in downtown *right now.*

Get some sleep, OP, you're drunk. *Over the last 15 years, the city’s had more extreme rain, according to a new study by Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) officials, who say the weather is a climate-change preview.*

“*This confirms our anecdotal evidence,” said James Rufo-Hill, an SPU meteorologist. “For years, people have been saying, ‘I think the rain is getting worse around here,’ and now the data shows that.”*

I moved here because I was tired of the heat and bright ass weather all the time. I have gnarly sensitivity to sunlight and heat that gives me awful headaches so when we get days were it clears up out of nowhere and it's all bright and stuff I hate it. I'm here for rain so let's do this shit Nope 😊 Sunny as fuck in Queen Anne and u district today and most of this last month... But I am willing to admit I'm a bit drunk Can't wait! Cool story you should move to Forks. Rains there more than just about anywhere in the state. Avg 212 days per year. Avoid Sequim for the opposite reason.  I can.
