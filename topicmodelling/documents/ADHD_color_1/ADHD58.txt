Struggle taking organized notes. Anybody have tips on taking notes in a more effective, organized way?  I like to use highlighters to color code my notes. :) headlines, titles, brackets , sections , pictures or sketches, etc. Don’t limit yourself, do whatever it takes to take organized notes that you’ll understand !
