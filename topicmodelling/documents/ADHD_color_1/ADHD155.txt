Out of sight, out of mind? Does anyone else have the problem of not realizing you haven't seen/talked to family in a long time?

This had alienated me from my family quite a bit, I don't realize that I haven't talked to them in a few weeks or more. I just get distracted by every day life and it seems like I just talked to them a few days ago. I've tried to explain that to my mother, dad, and grandma but they don't understand. My grandma got mad that I don't call her I told her I don't realize it's been that long and I asked why she can't call me she tried to say she didn't have long distance (which my mom confirmed she does).  Needless to say it's been a long time since I talked to her. My mother has gotten better about picking up the phone and just calling me. She still gets upset that the grand kids go to my inlaws often, I explained that's just because of my wife and if it were left just to me it would be the same situation. My dad rarely calls me and when I remember to call him every few months he's usually driving and can't talk (trucker) hardly calls me back. For Father's Day I was proud of myself because I was working a 12 hour shift but remembered to send him a text saying happy Father's Day and saying sorry I couldn't call I was at work and just wanted to tell him while I thought of it. And no acknowledgment from him of even getting it. The worst part came tonight when my mother called and informed me she just got off the phone with my dad. He says that he is completely disowning me. I was shocked and asked why. Apparently it's because I didn't call and offer my condolences for his sister dying. I asked when that was and my mother said she called me the other day and told me. This vague memory pops into my head of getting a call from her in the middle of the day something like 2pm and talking with her. The problem is I'm currently on my 4 month shift of working nights and this was towards the end of my week (I work 80 hours in a week then get a week off) so needless to say nothing was really registering. At this point I get upset and ask how come he can call my sister and her to inform them but can't call me and then decide to disown me for not calling him. She said she didn't know and I mention how he won't ever call me or return texts/calls. She said that he mentioned I texted him on Father's Day yet he couldn't acknowledge me after I did. I was finally just furious and she told me to just tell him that she never did tell me and that's why I didn't call but I said no I'm fine with him disowning me it's not like it will be that big of a change compared to the last 25+ years since my mother and him got divorced. 

Sorry for the rant. Just really upset since I got the call a couple hours ago. 

  I'm just wondering if this is common with ADHD, a couple other people I know that have it say that this happens to them just not as bad. 


TL;DR I can go months without talking to friends or family and not realize it. Try to explain I don't mean to do it, doesn't work. Mother calls, I talk to her while still basically asleep, informs me of something important, don't remember, and now I'm disowned by my dad.  I have a similar experience with friends and family. I guess the way I did it, (got through it) with friends is I've surrounded myself with people who are independent and don't need me in their lives constantly. We can all go weeks or months without talking and then just come back and have a good ol'conversation or watch a movie. 

Now for family, your dad sounds as irrational as my dad. It's a thing most people have though is they want to feel needed or wanted. I'm assuming they know you have ADD, but of course most people blow it off as nothing, etc. I haven't talked to my grandma in a long time, I even forgot to thank her a present she sent me and I need to do that, but as soon as I think of something else that thought it gone. 

The only suggestion I could give is maybe think of a way to remind yourself, like sending yourself an email or a text to remind yourself to talk to people, or calendar reminders. Like at the end of each week. 

P.S. I've observed people a lot so far in my life. People love it when you call for no other reason than to see how they are doing. Don't talk about yourself, just try and listen to what they are saying as best you can and you will brighten their day. Just some friendly advice on keeping you on someone's good side. :) It is very common in ADHD and it is one of the core features of this disorder.

It has made it harder to maintain friendships or create them with me.  Either I am too impulsive and clingy and do things fast, or I am the opposite where I am thinking about one thing and I am in my own little world and *I do not maintain relationships* for my memory is forgetting about the other things I consider important.

Scientists call this type of memory **prospective memory** but I like Dr. Barkley's common man explanation... This type of memory purpose is

* Remembering

 * **So as to do**

You are not remembering for the information is useful as in its self, you are not remembering for it gives you some form of advantage of possessing this memory.  No you remember so as you can do a later action, you know what the action is going to be, but you can't do it now, thus you must wait and them implement the plan at a later date when the circumstances allows action that you have already created.  It is seeing the future in the present, and then extending your will into changing the long term future. I answered your logical question, but you need a response to your personal circumstances.

What your dad is doing with disowning you sucks, it is understandable but it is emotional blackmail.  My advice is to wait for him to calm down and then call him back apologizes, say you hate this too and do an **emotional vulnerable** saying how much this trait of you hurts you and **it is not willful**, and before you give him a chance to respond you pause but you quickly transisition to what can I do to make this better.   You show your emotion, but then you pivot to action.  You are now talking not about hurt feelings but instead **about relationships** and actions you two can take to **strengthen** the relationship or **repair** the relationship.

Instead of regurgitating feelings just for re-experiencing the feelings and getting angry and bitter about the past memories, you are now trying to channel those constructive feelings into something productive.  The pain you experience in the past is over, it is no longer actively hurting you.  The only time it hurts you in the present is with your imagination that the future is going to be like the past and thus your body shudders and shrivels and is in pain for this is supposed to cause you to take action to not experience a worse pain in the future.  But by just telling that you hurt, and what can we do to make this better we engage our imagination brain without triggering the emotional side effects of experiencing pain.  It becomes something more like a game where you two are playing, a fantasy world that you can then somehow bring to reality.

If he gives you a fast response with not thinking, just saying you do no do what you used to do, or you should be automatically proactive and call and stuff explain that this is very difficult for you.  It is not willful but this is your weakness.  It is like him asking a person with poor color differentiation (male colorblindness) from telling specific shades of color.  They see color but not the same variety as other people, they see 16 colors in the crayola box while another person may see 48 (not equally loss of colors but in a specific range like blues and purples or greens / browns/ red).

Or it is like you asking someone to remember something when 2 other people are talking to them at the same time and those other people are also saying important things.  You do not talk to your dad in the car, when his wife and another person is also talking to him about different subjects.  This is chaos and the brain is bad at remembering in this situation, well your brain is like that all the time.

Now after the explanation pivot to real world action, ask him not for theoretical things, but for **commitments you can do**, and **commitments you can schedule** with automatic reminders weeks in advance via an cellphone calendar.  We want to automate this automatic reminding so you do not need to use your brain which is bad at this.  We want several reminders spread out over time so if you can't do it now, 48 hours you get a reminder again and so on.  We also want something that is physical and not emotional, I can show my love for you, by taking you to a ball game, or bring home bbq and we talk face to face.  Talking over the phone is something that is more abstract and it is harder for our brain to prioritize.  The reason why is phone conversations are sensory deprived with only audio, our brains are not wired to remember this all human brains but ADHD more so than others.  When we plan the future we plan **actions**, and we use multiple senses to plan this.  For example we are going to hunt buffalo, well our brains know this is going to need physical movement, with going to a new environment, it needs you to bring tools (a commitment), it will  require changing circumstances such as weather, temperature, time, all this stuff is change, it is **action not merely an idea.**  Remembering to call on the phone is merely an idea and thus does not have the emotional and sensory baggage uniting the priority.

There is a reason long distance relationships have a lower success rate, our brains are hardwired to prefer human contact, with touch, sight, smell, hearing, etc.  Our body has different types of memories for **events and experiences** vs ideas and abstraction. This is crrepily similar to me. It's not like I don't love them, but I am unable to remember to call them when I'm not with them. Whenever they ask "don't you ever miss us" it hurts me to think that I don't. I don't know why.  But when I'm around them, I am quite focused on them. I really relate, buddy. Overreactive divorced Dad, and ADHD makes for a real hard time bothering to keep in touch with friends and family. I hear it quite often from my (very nosy) sisters that they never hear from me anymore. To be honest, I doubt they'd visit Mom nearly as often if not for the fact they dump their kids on her every day.  Yes, it goes hand in hand with being in your own little world...
How to explain to people that you WISH you had a more clear mind. Didn't even read your whole post. Just the title and first line... but sheesh the whole "out of sight out of mind" thing rings so true to me in my daily life.  That's what I like about my friends, we haven't talked in about a month but I could call them up and say "hey let's go to the range and shoot some shit this weekend or work on the cars/bikes" and it will be awesome. They realize that I'm busy with work and kids and that I get distracted, it's not that I hate being around them it's just I haven't even realized it's been awhile since we hung out. 

The family thing is just crazy, I'm glad my mother is coming around and realizing it's not because I hate talking to her or being around her. But my grandma and dad are pretty much the same in that I need to call them and they can't call me. But they will both call my sister or mother no problem. I just don't get them. But  I will take your suggestion of calendar reminders to call my mother atleast, as for my dad and grandma I can apparently just keep doing as I'm doing and I won't even realize I haven't talked to them. Lol. but really I will probably call my dad and try to explain to him what happened and see where it goes from there.  Thank you for the advice. I will have to give him a call in a few days, reminder set in my phone.  I feel bad about it too. My wife asked if I missed her and the boys when they went to a family reunion and I had to work, had to explain to her I didn't even really realize they were gone that long. Luckily she understood  Sounds like my sister.  Another post here had this video. It helped them explain it, maybe it will help you!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyDliT0GZpE Thanks. I actually watched a few of his videos earlier. Very insightful, I hope to use some of his stuff to help my oldest son who was diagnosed at 5. I'm just glad we know early unlike with me being diagnosed when I was 23, I will be sending the links to my mother and hopefully she can get others in my family to watch them.
