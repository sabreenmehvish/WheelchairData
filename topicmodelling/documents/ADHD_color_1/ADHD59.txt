Looking for set of Mesh and Marble Fidget Toys in a single color or as a set of dark colors. Does anyone know where I can find something like this: https://www.amazon.com/My-Fidget-Friend-Relaxing-Relieves/dp/B01LPKGAC0/ref=pd_sim_200_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01LPKGAC0&pd_rd_r=Z3FWQTQKZ5K1FFSRDHZ8&pd_rd_w=V8IPe&pd_rd_wg=H172O&psc=1&refRID=Z3FWQTQKZ5K1FFSRDHZ8 but in all black? Or maybe gray/black? I'm interested in the fidget toy and I think it will help me a lot but I can't deal with the bright colors.  I'd try looking for it on Etsy, handmade things are usually more customisable! I'd try looking for it on Etsy, handmade things are usually more customisable!
