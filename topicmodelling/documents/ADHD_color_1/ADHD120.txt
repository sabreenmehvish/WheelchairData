How can we custom design this reddit to be BOLD and RAINBOW and other things that will help us READ IT :} are we the only subreddit that by nature requires a rad design? I prefer dark or simple colour schemes on websites bc if it's too bright or busy it can give me a migraines, and just generally annoy me.

if people wanted to help other users read things, they'd remember to use paragraphs tbh! If you have the app "slide" on your phone you can  customize it to many colors which is what i do  I find it easier to read as black and dark grey. I think rainbow colors would make my eyes cross.  You don't. We will never implement this as the subreddit default. Of course, you can create your own userstyle with Stylish or another browser extension, but that's up to you.
