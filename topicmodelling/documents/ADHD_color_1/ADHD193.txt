What can I take a little time to do now to help me for the semester? I'm starting the new semester on Monday, and I'm looking for small projects I can do now to increase my productivity for the semester. I already put 25 outfits (top, bottom, jacket if needed) on hangers, and organized my bathroom (I have an easy to access box with all the things I use every morning to get ready.) I live at home, so I don't have a dorm room or anything. I just drive the 10 minutes to school. What other projects can I do? My favorite part of apstarting a new semester is purchasing and obsessively organizing all of my school supplies. I usually wait till after the first week of classes so I know what I'll need specifically, but generally speaking as an undergrad I would start with
 
*a very specific planner ( [I used this one](http://www.paynepub.com/tm-33_time_master_planner.aspx). It lays the week out in vertical columns, with a monthly view for each month. I think its perfect and I loooove it.) 

*a small, separate binder for each class. Different colors. 

*a butt-ton of my favorite pens and colored pens/highlighters 

When I'd gotten all my syllabi (?) I'd organize each class in a binder, then write down all the assignments/tests in my planner, color coded to match my binders. It would really help me out through the whole semester. Starting with a good clear system helps you get back on track if you slip up or get behind

:) I love the outfit idea I have to try that. Good luck with classes! If your doing everything online I would recommend:

**cleanup your machine**

* remove as many distractions as possible from your computer like links to games apps etc, if you dont want to uninstall them atleast take them off the desktop.
* create and organize some links to class related items like course calendars assignments, class billboards/chalkboards etc
* depends what system the school is using but some can even connect up with your personal devices calendars and then you can see assignments and other items right on your phone.  Most of them take a bit of work to get this done
* cleanup the area around your desk or where you will be working.

**get into a routine** - try to get a schedule worked out that aligns with your class schedule

* set your alarm at a consistent time
* make scheduled times for exercise that doesn't conflict with when assignments will normally be due (Friday or Monday), regular exercise actually helps with learning and being more attentive
* get some study times setup where even if you don't have class work due you can say read the next chapter or something, getting used to spending the time early makes it easier when you actually need the time.

**get to know your classmates if you can**

* set aside some time to meet with your classmates (if you can) makes it easier to ask when you need help with an assignment, this is likely very awkward if you do only online classes.
* look into any student services the school offers remote students. Post anything you need to memorize e.g. foreign language vocabulary, on a wall where you can read it while sitting on the ~~toilet~~ thinking throne.   Find ways to keep your assignments and obligations organized! 

I bought a sturdy, medium sized planner. Last night I took my school's academic calendar for August through May and wrote every single event with any relevance to my life in each monthly calendar. I'm planning to write the events on the individual days, as well. I'll do the same thing as soon as I get my syllabi. It should save time later in the semester when I'm actually busy, and it'll help me get on top of deadlines before they're just a couple days away. I also won't have to constantly refer to four or five different syllabi, my school's calendar, and my personal calendar if it's all written in one place. 

Once the semester starts, you can also use a whiteboard or sheets of paper to keep track of weekly deadlines. I did this for the last month of school last semester and it really helped me. Each class had a color, I highlighted things being graded, crossed things off as I completed them, and took down each sheet at the end of the week. I used a smaller whiteboard to keep track of things I had to do around campus, too, like appointments, checking my mail, etc. It was right next to my bed so I saw it every day. 

Keeping myself on task and remembering everything I have to do are some of my biggest issues at school, but techniques like these have definitely made it easier.  This is basically exactly what I do except instead of a planner, I use google calendar. It sinks to all of my devices and it's color coded with built-in reminders. I definitely do the binders and the assignments into the calendar thing though. Overall, this is great advice.  Thanks! These are great! All of my assignments are online now, so I don't usually do binders. Any idea for how to plan out all of my online assignments? Good luck! Well, I'm actually on campus, they just do most of the assignments online. These are great tips, regardless! I've always had a bit of trouble with online ones, the physical world is much easier for me to keep up with than the digital. One good (and bad) thing is very inflexible deadlines, which make procrastination impossible after a certain point. 

I still recommend keeping a paper planner, although everyone is different. It can be really helpful and calming to have a physical guide for yourself, plus the feeling you get from seeing things get crossed off is unequalled. When I would get overwhelmed sometimes I would flip back a few pages and see all the things I already *did* accomplish, it would help me feel capable of crossing off whatever was next.  Thanks! I'm with you, I hate the online assignments. They're hard to keep up with. I'll find myself a planner, then.
