Metaphors. How do you think of ADHD and its symptoms? How do you explain it to others? **Metaphors** are wonderful. They can be **clever** and **entertaining**. More importantly for me, they can **facilitate learning**, **make connections**, and **communicate complex situations** using shared knowledge. Because of this they are useful when explaining a situation to someone who cannot experience it first hand (yet or ever). 

*Oddly enough I find myself creating countless metaphors for my own mind. I have been diagnosed with ADHD-PI this past year and its possible I make these metaphors to fill in my own gaps and make it easier getting started on a complex task.* 

**Here is one of many metaphors relating specifically to ADHD, but it can be generalized to other disorders:**

* **Computers** can easily be compared to our brains. Other than how to use them, most people don't know a whole lot about computers. For instance, how they work and all their various components. Because of this, they simplify things into a few key parts. How much **Memory(RAM)**? How big is the **Hard drive/SSD**? What utilities can it do, oh, and what about the display? Maybe a few others. These are all individually important things, but similar looking systems can have large differences in performance. When looked at briefly it may not be apparent, but with every day use those differences can be significant. *For me,* ADHD is like having a computer with a small **cache** (there are several other components that also apply to ADHD). It doesn't matter how fast the thinking, or how much is in the full storage if you can only do one thing at a time and have to start fresh every time you change tasks.

* With **mental health** you get the same disinformation. How smart are you, how good is your memory, what are you good at? You can try to explain to someone that, yes, you are smart enough to do your homework, but sitting down to do it in an efficient manner is another story. You can be smart, have great overall memory, and be able to do several things really well. But with ADHD and deficiencies in *Working Memory* you can only hold enough information for the current task and not the peripherals. For people who have a "balanced" brain, for lack of a better word, it can be hard to understand how critical that deficiency can be.

> "Parents and teachers tend to assume that these very bright
persons, could focus on any other tasks equally well, if
only they chose to do so. These observers do not understand
that although ADHD appears to be a problem of
insufficient willpower, it is not (Brown, 2005)."

*As I am constantly striving to understand and improve my own condition it helps to be able to describe it to others, especially those in your support system. I'm thinking about adding other metaphors/resources here, both to explore all the nuances of ADHD to ourselves but also as tools to explain our experiences and difficulties to others.*


**TL;DR** Our brains are like computers. You can't understand how they work by looking at just a few specifics. How big is the memory, can it go on the internet? How smart are you, can you do this assignment? For me, ADHD is like having a small cache, it doesn't matter how fast the thinking, or how much is in the full storage if you can only do one thing at a time and have to start fresh every time you change tasks. Most people who have a fully balanced system can't understand how critical one little part can be.
 I work with kids, and sometimes i have to explain what ADHD is. I tell them it's like a rubix cube. You're trying to figure out the code to solve the puzzle, but at the save time you're looking at the colors and counting the squares. Sometimes it gets you fustrated, but you have to keep trying to focus on the code to get all the colors on the same side, without the colors distracting you I guess this isn't only applicable to ADHD, but either way: today I used a stick shift car to explain how I felt. :) 

On days I work extremely hard (mostly only happens when on medication), I often end up completely beat at the end of the day. Rather than being very tired, I usually end up still having this huge rush (of adrenaline?) inside of me, which makes me not be able to do anything. Today was one of those days after working on a final assignment from 09am - 6pm in the university library. When I got home, my parents couldn't really understand what state I was in. I described it as following, while my dad drove me home from the train station and I was inspired by the car:

See it as a car with stick shift. At the beginning of the day, you start off in your first gear and as the day progresses, your speed increases and you shift to the next gear accordingly: at 11am you're in your second gear, at 1pm you're in your third gear, 3pm you're in your fourth gear, 5pm you're in your fifth gear and by the time you've passed 6pm, you're suddenly stuck in your sixth gear and for some reason you're still accelerating. By the time you realize how fast you are going and that you clearly should slow down, you're going way too fast to shift back into your fifth gear, not to mention shifting back to maybe the second gear you'd want to be at. And so you just have to sit there and wait until your speed has decreased, so the engine can handle a lower gear. Since, for now, your gears are just spinning too fast to catch onto them to slow them down.

Writing this, I'm not even sure if it's comprehensible, hahah. At least my parents understood :) Anyway, I'm sure I've used a bunch of other metaphors.. Too bad I forget them so easily!

 1. Mental cat herding. Imagine that in order to do any task, you have to herd all your cats across a path and to a specific destination. Once the cats are all there, you can do your task.

But that doesn't mean that the cats will let you herd them, or that they'll actually stay put once you get there. Whenever a cat leaves, you have to chase off and bring it back, and hope that none of your other cats sneak off as you do so.

2. Another metaphor I like to use is that everyone has a bag of marbles and mine has holes in it, and that I can't do anything unless I have all the marbles in the bag, and that every time one falls out I have to find it and put it back.

I also like calling it driving with the accelerator flat to the floor while having the handbrake on. Meds takes off the handbrake. I consider ADHD to be a bug in our operating system. A bug we have been trying to find our entire lives that causes unpredictable errors in our computations. An input of 2 might spit out a 3 or a 9 or both, we don't really understand it ourselves; we've gone over the code so many fucking times and a lot of us feel like failures for not finding the bug :( You know big city tourists?  The ones with the maps and hip-packs who stop in the middle of sidewalks to gawk at the buildings or figure out where they are?  The ones who seem to be perpetually amazed, confused, or both?  Who take so much longer to get on the subway because they need to figure out each step?  Who spout observations and questions about the city that at first don't appear logically connected to you, a city native?

And you kind of understand why tourists act this way, and it's not like you really object to people visiting your city- but they get in the way, they waste your time with their slow pace and their questions, they make too big a deal out of ordinary things, and you don't understand why they can't figure out public transportation faster.  They're harmless but exasperating.

The ADHD person living in a non-ADHD world, among non-ADHD people, is basically that tourist.  You know you don't quite "get it" like other people do.  You look like you don't have your shit together because you're trying to navigate a world that is non-intuitive to your brain.  You have to carry lots of stuff with you or you forget about it.  You have to stop and think about every step of a process, every time you do it, and this makes you slower.  You're forgetful and need to ask a lot of questions.  

But sometimes, your different perspective can lead to insights other people can't see at first glance.  And to the ADHD mind, even ordinary every-day things can seem quite exciting- we live in a world full of color and novelty and a huge array of endlessly fascinating distractions that other people's eyes slide right past. At the end of the day (fifth gear) you can't just down-shift to second without grinding the gears and wreaking havoc on the transmission. I'm assuming in your analogy you don't have breaks, so you have to just slow down naturally until you can down-shift gear by gear. Yes, I've thought of it in a similar way. Not a bug exactly, but just a general kink in the system. My mind can process things at the same speed as others but it makes a lot more errors. Either I accept this, or I try to reduce the errors to a comparable level which slows everything down. Its to the point that I expect the errors even when they aren't there, and it makes me perfectionistic at the cost of more time than is reasonable.
