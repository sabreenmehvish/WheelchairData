ADHD and technology Hey guys.

I'm wondering if we could compile a list together of useful websites, iphone applications, and other technological devices that have made our ADHD lives easier? For me, I know my iphone was a life saver. I almost cried once or twice when Siri was organizing my day .. it made me realize that there are probably many more applications out there that could really benefit me, i'm just unsure of what they are at the moment. 

I'm familiar with Penzu. There's my contribution. If anyone doesn't know what Penzu is: it's an online journal .. you're guaranteed to not lose it. Haha. Since it's online and accessible at the click of a button. It's been a lifesaver since i like to vent and process my day in writing .. but i also have a tendency to lose shit all.the.time. Also, Penzu allows you to "clip" images on your journal pages - so it's stimulating format which creates a catalyst to write : ) Everyone else, go! Period tracker apps for me have been a lifeaaver. I have three kids and can't remember when the last one was or when I should expect the next. All I do is hit the button saying I got it and it does the math and everything else for me. Evernote, evernote, evernote.. 

Also, lastpass.  Sometimes google keep, cycle tracker, color note. I live on color note. This is a great idea. I use Spring Pad (which is like evernote) and Tumblr to keep myself free of the '100 tabs open' problem. You can install plug ins for Chrome that adds buttons beside the search bar; when I'm getting distracted I use these to file away or post all the content for later and get back to what I'm supposed to be doing.   Self Control for blocking distracting apps. Works so well that I bought the ad-free version https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.specialj.selfcontrol **Pocket** is really useful for **saving articles and videos**, pretty much anything. Instead of opening a bunch of tabs and leaving them open for hours (or days) on end intending to read them, you just save it to pocket and go back later. Or if you've found that you have wayyyy too many bookmarks on your computer (the reason I got it in the first place), pocket is great for sorting and keeping track of stuff found online. 

For **reading articles online** I like to use **BeeLine**. It really helps when I have to read long articles on my computer. It uses a color gradient on text to help with skipping/repeating lines and such. The color gradient can be customized according to what helps you the most. There is also an extension for using BeeLine to read PDF files. 

**Noisli** is a **background noise/color generator** useful for writing. You can input text and save it to read later, like an online journal. I really only use it for the background noise, but it might be helpful for those who want distraction free writing online. 

Another site I have found, but have not personally used yet, is **Trello**. It **organizes projects** into boards online. It has lists where you can keep track of things you need to do and things you have done by allowing you to add tasks and then check them off once completed. Simpleology has been great for improving my organizational skills and prioritizing my daily tasks. 

Check it out; its helps you put into writing all those ideas/deadlines that are bouncing around in your head and then neatly organize them. Decide what needs to be done today and push back what doesn't for another.

It also syncs with your on-line calender!  I started using kanbanflow.com it has a timer on it that after 25 minutes of concentrated work it will tell you to take a break and give you 25 points. The points  you can use to rank yourself against other people. If you have to stop working before the 25 minutes you have to select a reason.

The to do list function works well too and I even upgraded to the premium edition to add some extra features like time reporting. I can't do without **Days since**, as I'm always drawing a blank on "When was the last time I..."-questions. I have found the 'Pebble' watch (which syncs to android and iphones) is a live saver for me. 

There are a range of apps out there that you can put on your watch/phone. Many of them work by the watch vibrating on your wrist - e.g. when I have a set a calender event, or a medication reminder. 

Another Pebble app allows you to ring your phone from your Pebble - even if it is on silent mode (as long as it is within distance, say, within the house is fine). your mobile has to be on/not flat for it to work ;)    - this app for the watch was really helpful for me, as I would misplace my phone everyday, about 4 times on average, and would take me at least 15 minutes to try and find it again each time. (my boyfriend is also very happy that I don't have to ask him "have you seen my phone??" "Can you please call my phone? - I cant find it!" numerous times a day.  

two of three main drawbacks about pebble or other smart watches: 
1. you need to remember where you put it.... (make sure you have a very obvious, regular place to put it. e.g. a hall table

2. You need to remember to re-charge it (however battery life is pretty good - 2 - 3 days on average) 

3. it does of course cost money, but pebble seemed to be the best option, and cost the less than all the other watches out there. 

4. Watch set up and installation of some of the apps isnt as user friendly as it could be... there were a few that had me going in circles for a while. I'm 26 years old, and have fairly good *basic* knowledge of computers, technology etc. - for someone who isn't too good basic use of computers. smart phones etc - a smart watch probably isn't the way to go (unless you have a friend or family member who help you out). 

One more thing I have found really useful (isn't tech related - but thought I should mention) - attaching a bright yellow post-it note pad to the back of the front door. 
Before I go to bed (or during the day) I write down things I need to remember (and write with a heavy black marker pen to make it really noticeable). 
Its pretty hard to leave the house without noticing bright yellow post it notes all over your front door. (make sure to remove any old notes which aren't relevant any more (your eyes will become lost in a cluttered sea of post-its - can become a little overwhelming, keep it simple, 2 - 3 post its at a time).  


This is a great idea for a thread, 
Thanks OP 
 I always use the reminder function on my iphone and set a million alarms to reminds me of things, not just waking up like everyone else.  Got and appointment?  Alarm reminder two hours before hand with a second reminder at the one hour mark.  I make lists of things in the notes to delete as I do them, or I make timetables to remind me what class and which room I have it in at what time.  The funny thing is I never remember to look for better apps, I just work with what I've got. Any.do

Somebody mentioned it last week here, and it's pretty boss. You put in shit to do and it comes up when you're dicking around on the net like, "hey dude you should go take out the trash or call your mom and say hi or whatever" Wow, i've never heard of this before. Cool. This is helpful - i'm twenty- seven years old, and it still blows my mind I haven't taken the time to notice when my cycle is. I have to retry Evernote.. the last time I downloaded it, i was immediately frustrated by its intricacies and pretty much dropped it   I use an app called any.do that I just can't recommend enough for folks with ADHD. Very simple pleasant interface...  It's almost impossible to get distracted or overwhelmed by too many options. It syncs with a partner calender app (that will also sync with your built in calender)  to add future stuff onto your daily to do list. And...  the best...  each morning, it automatically pulls up an "any.do" moment that lets you review the day ahead of you. I've tried a bunch of other methods to keep on task, and this has been by far the most helpful.  I can't stress enough how simple and helpful Google Keep is, I figured it out in a few seconds by just playing with the home screen widget. The picture function was what drew me in so much because I have a tendency to write situational specific notes that make absolutely no sense later when I go back over them. With Google Keep I take a picture of what I'm thinking about or am interested in, jot down a few lines of text like I normally would, and the visuals combined with my writing takes me right to back where I was when I made the alert. It's a game changer. Well when you are trying not to add to the brood and can't take the pill as you forget to, its just easier this way. They recently added reminders. As a student, I can make a note for my big project and add a due date. In the note, I can have a checklist of everything I need to finish for it, and these can even be linked to other notes with their own mini due dates. Your reminders sync with Remember The Milk, which in turn syncs with Google Calendar. Add reminders for everything, and then you can see your whole week planned out on gcal.
