I took it upon myself to get the help I've needed after all of these years this month but almost regretting it now... For years my ADHD had gotten ignored because of how poor my mental heath was. My teachers, principal, doctor, counselors, and quite frankly even myself all had had no other focus although I hate to admit this but I wasn't even aware of what exactly ADHD was until this month. I just didn't act much on the symptoms because of being clueless basically. I've addressed my issues though and especially to my latest counselor and often to him, who I've seen for maybe 2 years now, and one teacher especially back then. I even told a health clinic during this time what has been going on. A lot is of my fault though and especially for not telling my doctor much and I absolutely regret it, I should've done it regardless, but at the time he was always rude to me and always brushed everything I told him to the side.

​

I attended high school from 2010-2014. I had some struggles with it but especially the last two years.  My memory and ability to keep focused had completely vanished. Developments occurred such as hearing what people have said but forgetting literally instantly or hearing them talking but hearing literally nothing they said at all and I struggled mightily processing things that people said. This was especially true if I had to learn something in a group of multiple people but not limited to that. I really struggled with things completely foreign to me in general, such as something like Chemistry or Art history.  The most complicated part in all of this is I struggle mightily with memory but I can remember things prior to these events things well, things prior to high school.

​

Everything has continued on this entire time, untreated for all of these years. But what has became a trend in these years as well is I have gotten asked if I had ADHD multiple times. That happened from all the way back then to this month. I truthfully never accepted it as a possibility because of pride basically, I was always smart, and I don't think I'm stupid even now and while I don't think those are at all I have a lot of skills to be successful and like I said earlier I admittedly also didn't have well knowledge about ADHD, I really didn't know exactly what it was. I also didn't have many priorities that required things I struggled with so I just lived life as-is, with some hope it would correct itself with time. With time however it appears to have actually gotten even worse.

​

This month in particular I struggled heavily with these issues and it was frustrating me a lot. For example I was hanging out with a friend and we were playing a game and it required things such as remembering multiple random movements, what the year was, what colors stood for what, and so on. It was a nightmare for something that was supposed to be fun and my friend wasn't helping on the manner either, she kept making fun of me basically and the worst part is she was actually aware of my issues. I was already extremely frustrated and then another friend asked me if I had ADHD and I practically dismissed it even then but I actually done research on ADHD this time and realized this entire time that is what has been happening to me. Those exact same things are what have happened and memory issues look to be linked to it as well although I do question how much in my case for the significance of my memory in particular, how poor it is.

​

I took it upon myself to finally do something, for what should've been done in 2013.  I had typed everything out and printed it and gave it to my doctor to read. That was the only way I felt he could understand and I have the ability to explain myself because of these same issues. He actually was very proud of me and impressed entirely and he actually responded. He believed that is indeed what has been going on and prescribed me Adderall as a result and my counselor agreed that is what has been going on as well, I shared the same thing I typed to him too.

​

So that all sounds great right? I can finally focus? Maybe I can even go to college? My doctor wanted me to because of my document.

​

Then there's the reality. Focusing doesn't matter a lot if you can barely even stand up or walk because of rib pain, especially after eating or drinking, which themselves are very difficult. I've had to sit down at multiple random places because of the pain or literally just stand still for several minutes, in too much pain to do anything else. I've realized I need to start riding my bike everywhere basically. Yesterday it only took two small oatmeal cookies and I was full. Today I had forced myself to have a lot, Burger King is mostly responsible for that because of getting my order wrong, but I decided to just do what they did and to try making up for previous days, I lost 13 pounds since I been on it, and I felt so horrible because of how full I was, I couldn't even get a drink refill to go. Sleep was also a huge issue but that seems to have corrected itself now and I had also gotten headaches almost every day but they too are getting better, not everyday, and that can be a sign things are getting better but even the remaining issues are still very alarming.

​

So I should switch right? Adderall is covered by my insurance company but Strattera somehow isn't. My prescription place keeps saying it can be covered if my doctor contacts the insurance company. Meanwhile the doctor's office keeps saying they have. Tomorrow will be the third day of back and forth and nothing getting done and me being miserable on Adderall sigh... What is the pain because of? Hunger?

Are you on instant release or long release?

I thought the long lasting/non instant would be better, but I found that instant release is better. I can break it up and control my doses better as I learn my body. Also eat before you take it. If you have to make the food while you're on it because you have focus... Just prep a simple breakfast you can heat up. Or make something really easy... But make sure it has fat and protein to keep you full.

You could also try Vyvanse. Vyvanse made me not that interested in food, but I could still eat if I knew I should. Even if it was half a sandwich and some fruit. Adderall I can eat if I have to but usually after it wears off.

Edit: word My short term memory sucks. I have to write it down or I will forget That’s why we need a place for everything. My mentor has me spend 15min every Saturday and Sunday putting labels all over my house for everything and things you want to have a few spot for where it can go has a limit of 3 places. It feel like a lot of work at first but it gets easier you just have to do it. I’ve always moved thing around in my house not sure where I’m the best spot for thing are. And I’d make myself dizzy and frustrated but I’m getting better especially now that I have to label all my drawers shelves cupboards that’s all I got so far.  I could eat once before regardless though to help me have more, that's really a great idea. I absolutely do need to eat, I can't really afford to lose much more weight Not sure, I've had rib pain literally as soon as I've began taking Adderall. It comes and goes and gets especially worse if I eat or drink something but not limited to that, it's happening right now for example and I haven't ate or drank in hours and I'm not hungry at all. The previous days could maybe get argued I could've been but couldn't feel it because of the Adderall but there's absolutely no way today.   


I don't understand the release question or the difference between the two I'm really sorry...  


Regarding eating before I actually did that today to experiment it but it didn't really go well. It basically gave the effect of not eating at all, it didn't make me any less hungry period. I delayed when I took Adderall today to test some things like that Regarding Vyvanse I could ask about that. I want to ask my prescription shop if it'll get covered first and foremost though. I don't want to waste my time and my doctor's. IR. I looked on google to see the difference between them. 10 mg IR Yeah same but even then I forget where I put it down at and find it multiple days after I needed to lmfao. I've realized I had to put it in my phone and set reminders and alarms of it. Meanwhile I've learned how to sleep through alarms because of how much I've relied on them, don't remember why I set them, and go back to sleep instantly all while the song keeps playing. How often? I feel like 10mg lasts me about 4 hours before I start feeling hungry again and maybe thinking about food.not all the side effects wear off by then, but enough. I actually need to update you... Things have gotten dramatically better suddenly today. I mentioned in the original post how some stuff was getting better but now I no longer am getting any rib pain and I can actually finally eat again without complete force as well. It just seems like it took my body a while to adjust to the Adderall. Time will tell regarding appetite throughout the day, although I probably won't eat again today or much more if I do. I wasn't a big eater exactly to begin with, I always had everything at once for the day or two smaller things, so with Adderall too that won't help with that and I already had a lot today by this point Nevermind... I had thought so and I was okay for that day but since then my Adderall had actually quit working and then these same things have happened again, minus appetite
