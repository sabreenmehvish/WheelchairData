Diagnosed with Mild-ADHD Going to the doctor's office tomorrow to see what my options are in terms of medicine. I'm in High School (11th Grade). I made an appointment with a local psychologist to get screened. After a few sessions she diagnosed me with it. I'm a bit confused. I assumed that everyone had a tiny bit of ADHD and just dealt with it. She said I need to try something new in terms of studying as well as try some medicine (vyvanse is what she was getting at). What should I expect now in terms of effects as well as how this will change my life? I'm not worried really I just want to know whats up.  Hey. ADHD is a very confusing disorder. While it's true that everyone struggles with some of the *symptoms* occasionally, it doesn't mean everyone has adhd, and the ones that don't show it just have it a little bit.

Anyway, when you take vyvanse,  it's common to feel more alert, more focused, more energized, happier. Some people experience other positive effects. The most common side effect is loss of appetite, so make sure to eat a healthy amount each day even if you don't feel hungry. 

You might get some other physical side effects, but these, at least in my experience, stopped happening after a few weeks of taking adderall (which is very similar to vyvanse) daily.

Honestly, don't *expect* much. It might be life-changing for you, you might hardly feel it, even with a high dose. The best thing you can do is take it one morning and forget about it, and go on about your day as you normally would. Let the observations come to you, don't go hunting for them. This is the best way of preventing placebo effect. *Read what I am saying* ***till the very end,*** *before thinking for what I say may seem offensive until you understand the broader point I am making.*

**Part 1)**  Yes everyone has a little ADHD, it is a **spectrum disorder.**  It has its extremes, there are people in the middle, and ADHD is a cluster at the very end the most extreme cases where there ADHD is an actual disorder that always causes hardships in your life instead of just a weird personality or just a forgetful memory.

**Part 2)**  Scientists in the last 15 years now know (for sure) the parts of the brain that ADHD affects and these brain parts connect together like a highway with cities in between.  Your brain thoughts are like little cars that go back and forth between cities on highways.

Well people with ADHD have brains that have traffic jams and/or broken roads on those highways.  These "problems" and "slowdowns" are caused by genetic factors, environmental factors that affect how your brain develops (especially prior to birth in your mother's womb and when you are a baby/toddler), and the combination of the two called epigenetics which is another name for environmental+genetics interactions.

**No person has perfect roads**, everyone has a little ADHD, but humanity is a spectrum and the ADHD people have enough problems with the roads that the cars just stop and some do not get to their intended destination.  The people with ADHD attention, memory, executive abilities are much worse, like 10 times worse than the normal population.

**Part 3)**  Now scientists have recognized *at least* 5 brain regions (5 cities) that are affected with ADHD and these 5 cities form 3 networks.  Think New York to LA, New York to Chicago, and New York to Florida.  The start of the journey may be the same for some parts, but eventually they branch out and are their own unique "highway network".  Yet ADHD people have problems on the highways in all 3 directions.

Some people may have such minor problems on these 3 things the cars still get there on times.  Some people may have problems with 1 of the directions but not the other two.  They may have problems in life but they look different, they do not look like ADHD, but when you have **severe** problems with all three networks then poof your ADHD.

Your brothers and sisters, parents, cousins, uncles, and aunts may share some of these problems.  They may not have enough problems to be ADHD and a lot will lead normal lives, but often you can find 1 person in the family that is also ADHD if you look hard enough if your ADHD is caused by genetics and not due to how your brain formed as a baby in your mommies uterus. One of the networks that is affected by ADHD is your ability to **internally motivate** yourself *especially when something is boring.* Other people can internally motivate themselves without meds for their brain network works, ***they*** *just need to try harder to make the brain motivate themselves.*

An ADHD person on the other hand can't try harder for their brain can't internally motivate due to genetics or environmental factors that shaped how the brain formed.

*Now ADHD people can be extremely motivated* but that motivation comes from **external** motivation, that or they already found the subject interesting and thus they do not need motivation.

----

Eventually you may realize after you finally get what ADHD means that people that say try harder make you want to slap them.  Resist the urge these people are trying to help they just do not know better or do not get it.

Be Careful about universalizing how you perceive the world to others, humanity is so different.  Trying to explain ADHD to a non ADHD person is sometimes like trying to explain the color purple to a person who is red green color blind that person is only seeing blue for his eyes can't see all the red in the universe.

Some people just won't get it till you use metaphors Can you please give me the source for your information. Not doubting you, but I just want to read more in detail from the source
 Thanks
