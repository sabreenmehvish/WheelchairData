Eye fatigue? Yellow glasses! Hey guys, so Iâ€™ve had a bit of a breakthrough and Iâ€™d like to share it with all of you!

So, I have a problem with feeling intensely fatigued at work, even when having taken medication. It doesnâ€™t matter how much sleep Iâ€™ve had, what Iâ€™ve eaten. Itâ€™s never gone away. Until my GP recommended buying â€˜blue light filter glassesâ€™. 

Oh my god guys, they work *so* well. Iâ€™ve been testing them for a week now and I havenâ€™t felt that fatigue at all! Itâ€™s made a huge impact and I paid less than $15 on amazon for them. Well, well worth the investment, as I know us ADHD folk need all the help we can get with solving factors that contribute to inattention  If you're on the computer heaps (I'd say we all are) get a program called flux. It does the same as the glasses just for free. 

 They also help (imo) with florescent lights. Florescents give me headaches and make me yawn a lot. That sounds cool, I have the same issues with feeling tired at work. I work in an area without windows and I get headaches from the lights and staring at my computer.  I discovered this a few months ago too. It works so well!! Second the recommendation for f.lux. But also for glasses - if you stare at a computer all day, also consider glasses  with a light reading rx.

I realize if you already have a real rx this may be more complicated, but years ago in college I thought my vision was going because I couldn't see boards anymore. I had an appointment scheduled for 2 weeks after the semester ended, and by then everything was fine. So they gave me glasses with a slight tint for glare (this was before smart phones so no blue light issues there) and a light reading prescription and it really helps. I still use them and my vision is otherwise still perfect and I can feel the difference if I stare at my computer for a while without using them. A friend of mine has neurological issues and pressure in her head, so she started using these. She now has tinted contacts, too! She absolutely loves them.  Definitely planning on getting a pair once I start my summer job! [redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) is another alternative, can set the colortemp statically for intraday relief of blue color, and also be configured to dim/cool more at sunset. At first I completely disagreed with this but I did some more research and, while I don't think flux should be considered a complete replacement of the glasses, it does help more than I thought.

I've been using flux for quite some time, but always found the glasses to ultimately provide better filtering. *If you have the right monitor* then you can turn flux wayyyyy down for the best effect. My monitor at home does not bode well with the lower bluelight settings.

The other reason I would recommend glasses is because of the typical lighting in the workplace. Usually fluorescent at 5500K temperature (high blue light similar to daylight). If you rely on flux alone you should use somewhere in the range of 2300k for best effect, but combine that with the brighter lighting in the office and the contrast in light can be just as tiring on the eyes.

The best solution is to use both. Use Flux at a moderate temperature (I use ~3000k) with the glasses. This gives protection from all blue-light sources. 

For those that really don't like the yellow part of the glasses, they [also have non-tinted ones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E0RR2FO/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B01E0RR2FO&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=950202000752607969&pf_rd_r=TGZ0C6JPXV5E6KHYVDV0&pd_rd_wg=pjWNy&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&pd_rd_w=jrMr4&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pd_rd_r=b1a811c4-54d1-11e8-b8cc-f9fd97f18a1a&smid=A41026RW2VJGQ). How does it go inside of applications? 
Flux can be completely shut inside some games. Ugh I wish there was a solution for people who need to see color accurately as part of their work on the computer... Issue is when you have to wear glasses to first seeðŸ˜‚ Are you asking how it runs with other things going? Ive had redshift run at the same time as games (not many; my sample size is very small), and it works fine. 

It can get confused if I'm using a VPN though. It uses geoclue to identify where you are in the world to get the sunset time, and popping out in Europe can cause the screen to cool before my local sunset time. Huh? There is! Just google computer glasses and youâ€™ll find plenty of non tinted ones for color sensitive work. I linked one in my last sentence  You can get computer glasses that have lens corrections. It will be more expensive, but itâ€™s worth it.  Just got new glasses. It can be applied same way auto tint can now. A bit pricey but worth it.  Oh cool! Thanks! Sorry I have limited amount of time to reddit each day so I was skimming. I assumed they all affected the color of the monitor. I will absolutely check out your link.  One day, one day. I was without flux my whole life and my eyes are fuckedðŸ˜‚ so not hurry. AFAIK, blue light levels donâ€™t have an impact on quality of vision...just FYI. Filtering it out will just give you less eye fatigue throughout each day More so my computer use and not practising proper eye techniques like 20/20/20. I also had an injury when I was younger which did some damage to vision in 1 eye.
