My Dad gets it now So, I was watching a documentary on attention on sbs they have a group talking about differences in attention and when it  verges   into ADHD.  Dad said that sounds like you.( mentally thinking No shit shearluck homes). They also had a shorter version of the welcher test, and he was amazed that he couldn't do it. TL:DR was watching a documentary on Attention and my dad get that I have Adhd now.  Do you happen to know what the documentary was called, guess it probably matters what country you are from, huh? Thanks in advance.  What is the welcher test?  I am in Australia it was on sbs insight

   Its a test that test your memory, spacial awareness and cognitive abilities. So they start of having a color in a different text color and you have to say the color of the word not the text.  Then play like a tetrius like game, etc  Thanks. Unfortunately I’m in the US so I can’t watch it. Glad it was helpful for you though.
