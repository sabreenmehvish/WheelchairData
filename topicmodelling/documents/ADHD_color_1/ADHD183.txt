Light Bulb Alternatives for ADHD? I have a problem. Fluorescent bulbs make my ADHD worse. I'm constantly distracted by their buzzing and flickering (they ALL buzz and flicker at weird rates... but the non-ADHD fold don't seem to care?) 

So, with the incandescent ban in place, does anyone have any solutions? LED look promising, but right now they don't have them at the store in the brighter wattages I need.  Sunlight is the best, of course, but it's not reliable and doesn't work at night.

Does anyone else have the issues with light bulbs? How do you cope? LED is probably your best bet, though Halogen might be a good option, too. It isn't as cost effective as LED, however. I've actually replaced most of the lights in my house with LED lights atm.

both have brighter higher wattage/lumen versions but were aprox 25-30$ each at home depot when I got them.  However they are supposed to last 20 years, don't really break if you drop em (way less delicate than the CFLs I replaced) and I haven't had to touch them in the 1-2 years since I put them in, versus the CFLS that constantly needed replacing in the same areas.

Added bonus I get sleepy in the bedroom and wake the hell up in the bathroom in the morning now.

I also have cheaper "daylight spectrum" floods that I replaced all 20-30 50 watt halogen pot lights in the ceiling with, and the 3 floods in each ceiling fan with, but the CRI on them sucks and they are much dimmer/ temperamental. So I may go higher quality on them.
 Do some looking for LEDs online... Amazon has them in higher wattages I believe, and as a bonus they've got reviews. The light given off by LEDs is not really "normal" looking, but it's more comfortable (to me at least) than fluorescents.  Check Amazon for LEDs.

I've personally never had a problem with CFLs as long as they are not the super cheap ones.   I've got a CFL based SAD light sitting on top of my computer case that I use all the time (since I never go outside).

 Switching all old bulbs to LED:s whenever the old ones dies out. The more I get the oldies out, the lesser background noise. hell, if i fix the flickering lights at my office, my brain will find something else flickering or clicking or something to focus on. [All incandescent bulbs aren't actually banned](http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/1/5263826/the-incandescent-light-bulb-isnt-dead), just the 40 and 60 watt sizes.  You can get other sizes and types. These are fantastic: http://www.ott-lite.com Just like sunlight! I have two little portable ones that I can take with me anywhere and set up wherever I need to. I love them.  I prefer dimmer lights, so I have an LED light plus a strip of LEDs that are RGB so I can set the right temperature. I also find fluorescents to be annoying. With all the other noises I typically have around me (HD noise, fan noise, home heating system, fridge, etc) plus my tinnitus, I find masking to work better than trying to eliminate the sounds. 

I do plan to switch to LED bulbs when my current ones die though. I've heard good things about the Home Depot Cree bulbs. This may not quite answer your question but I found that using lamps instead of overhead lighting was FAR less distracting and annoying.  

I also use CFL's with the covers over them (they look like regular light bulbs) and they don't seem to make any noise but they are slow to turn on to full brightness.   I use LEDs wherever I can. The light is beautiful and flicker-free. 

Also note that the directional LEDs are WAY cheaper than the omni ones and are also easier to find in higher wattages/lumens. If you have ceiling fans, recessed lighting, or feel like installing tracks, you may well be able to use directional LEDs to achieve the brightness you're looking for. Have you seen this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitivity_in_humans#Fluorescent_lamps I used to have a light that made a steady quiet hum, but would occasionally and randomly make a single tick sound. Drove me *nuts* because I would stop whatever I was doing and listen to see if it would happen again. > cause cutting out the blue light for sleeping

? You can get daylight LED bulbs that produce the same spectrum for a lot cheaper. Ott-Lites WERE the best, I own two myself, but now I feel they're overpriced compared to what else is available for less. It's apparently not good for your eyes to be looking at or be near blue light (example: your LCD monitor or TV) when it's night. Blue light generally means 6500k and up on the kelvin scale. Daylight is 5600k and tungsten (incandescent light bulbs) is about 3200k. Candle light is 2700k I believe.


Anyways it's better for your eyes to be looking at or near redder lights at night. Hence why people use f.lux for computer monitors: justgetflux.com F.lux is the best! I stay up late on the internet (duh) and I've noticed that since I installed it over a year ago my (usually night time) depression hasn't been as bad. Obviously there are a lot of other factors, but it's also easier on my eyes and my friend who has migraines said it's been a lifesaver.
