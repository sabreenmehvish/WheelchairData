What are some school supplies you would recommend?  A planner but more importantly an organization system. Figure out how you will approach keeping a syllabus handy, note taking in class and from books as well as how you want to keep records of assignments. Your supplies should work to contribute to your system to make things easier for you to maintain your organization. A zip container that always has everything you need in it like pencils and stuff so you don't have to remember where individual things are.  Color coded binders/notebooks. Pick a certain color for each subject and keep it every year (math is always blue, language arts is always purple, etc). That way you have a very easy way to always know you have the right supplies with you. If you're in college you can do like morning classes are always red, lab classes are always blue, etc.

Planners are really great and I also recommend getting something like [this stacking colored pencil](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00BJ3IB12/ref=pd_aw_sbs_21_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1BVBBDVBVC9NG05R050A) to use on it. Use the same colors are your notebooks to write down assignments. That way it's not "'Read ch 2'...Crap which subject is this? Which book should I bring home?" followed by, lbr, a distraction and then you forget your book. Instead it's "Assignment in red. Bring red book home. Don't need to think about anything else rn." I like taking out the brain power required for things and keeping them visual, and therefore existing outside my head, instead of relying on my flightly thoughts.
