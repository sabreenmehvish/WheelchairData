Just recently startes taking Dextro Amphetamine this week And I am so happy. I finally had a meeting with a doctor who understood that I was having a paradoxal reaction to Welbutrin, understood that Ritalin always entirely zombified me, and just talked to me like a human. 
I can focus without having the attention span of a squirell, without getting sidetracked consistently, and it works well with the rest of my perscriptions. 
Colors are literally brighter, everyone. 

Just wanted to share â™¡

Lol that might just be dilated pupils. Which I think is temporary.  Hah, sorry if that sounds weird. It's taken a while to get on a regiment of medicine that handles my Genereal Anxiety and ADHD.  Yeah that's understandable. It doesn't sound that implausible.
