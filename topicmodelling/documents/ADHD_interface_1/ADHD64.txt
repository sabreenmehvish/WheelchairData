In the past six months, I have been... 1. **An aspiring author!** In July I thought of *the most amazing* concept for a book. I spent so many evenings building a summary, and I created a massive outline of the entire plot. I haven't looked at the PDF since July.

2. **An aspiring software developer!** In October I thought of *the most amazing* concept for a game. I wrote down my ideas, created interface mockups, and started Part 1 of CodeAcademy's Python lesson. I'm still on part 1.

3. **An aspiring multilinguist!** In October I also decided to learn Turkish because my wife has Turkish relatives and I wanted to be *really* impressive. I downloaded Duolinguo and enthusiastically went at the lesson plan. Eventually Duolingo started getting passive-aggressive with its insistence that I don't give up, so I deleted the app.

4. **An aspiring investor!** In November I decided that a good way to stop spending all of my savings would be to put some of it in the stock market and *make more money doing nothing*. I learned about portfolios and what the S&P 500 was and why my 401K is doing absolutely nothing right now. I even opened a brokerage account! Its balance started at $0; TODAY, it's still at $0.

5. **An aspiring software developer again!** In January I thought of *the most amazing* concept for a productivity app. It was so cool, so responsive, and more in-tune with your daily habits than anything before! I excelled at the the "dwell on it obsessively for hours each day without actually putting anything to action" stage. Still on part 1 at CodeAcademy.

6. **An aspiring computer designer!** This week I thought of *the most amazing concept* for a handheld gaming device. I've designed literally five different models of it in my head, not including accessories. I've imagined a logo, software, and some great interviews I'll have once it's *obviously* a huge success.  A huge amount of work has happened in my head; in the real world, literally nothing has happened.

You know what's crazy about ADHD? 

You can't ignore the urge to try *everything*; but in the end, you feel unable to accomplish *anything*. For me it's basically the same thing, only other things in the list.

"Wanting to do a lot, but not getting anything done because I did nothing or because I did everything" - Short term  

"Planning a lot, but not actually doing anything because I'm already planning the next thing" - Long term




 Lol, yeah...this is so me. I've had more career aspirations than I can count, and each time I am SO SURE it's my calling in life.

A month or so ago I decided being a librarian was my calling, almost quit my very steady IT job and went back to grad school....glad that phase passed.

Before that I was going to get a second degree in Environmental Science. 

It's just getting exhausting now. Oh god so true. September I started working on my animation series idea.

-keep changing the main ideas and scrapping things,

Meh? I'll find something eventually. Yes, indeed. Songs pop into my head while I'm in the shower, I think of great lines for the play I'm never gonna write, etc.  I only get good at things that I stuck to for some other reason than continued interest, like becoming a good cook to avoid having to eat my mom's cooking. I am absolutely convinced I'm a genius, but I have nothing to show for it, except being a pompous know-it-all. Duolingo sucks, though. I deleted it too. I just found this sub. I was diagnosed as a child at the same time as my father took custody of my brother and I. My mother wanted me to go on medication, but my father was one of those people who don't believe in ADHD, so I stopped seeing the psychologist. 

It's kinda nice to know that there's a reason I'm like this. In the past month I thought of a brilliant idea for an app, and got as far as downloading and installing the android dev software, and came up with an idea for a lamp (that I still think is really cool), spent hours designing it with 3d cad (which I had never used before), and as much as I want to finish it, I know I won't.  The last sentence. It's so true it hurts. Please read this book! 
It changed the way i viewed my endless endeavors 

https://www.amazon.ca/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4 my thing is, I actually get obsessed with these things and I study them exhaustively. To the point I can quote things. But I never actually DO anything with them.  An aspiring youtube know-it-all. "aspiring investor" that one hit me hard, I'm down 5K since I've started trading Why are goals so hard  >4.

Just put all your savings into S&P 500 ETFs and you should be fine. Warren Buffet recently proved that active investing is a waste for the vast majority of people. If you actually want to trade I'd recommend watching Martin Shkreli's videos. Ah, I feel you. This reads funny but it's also true which makes things sort of hectically depressing but fun. Life is interesting when you always seem to have your foot on the gas and your hand changing stations by the minute. I you ever still want to do 2., i found 'Learn python the hard way' wayy more fun than Codeacademy. It's way more letting you fiddle and test out instead of taking you by the hand and making you do boring simple stuff. Ofc i also never finished it but i ran trough part of the excersices, got some new ideas for things i want to script and now still go back to it once and a while to check up on something and then i realise can still use some of the other exercises to learn something i haven't gotten a 100% grasp on. Getting an idea for a project is the best way of learning python but a game is pretty over your head if you are a total programming beginner. Making something like an automatic-cat-name-list-sorter is way better place to start. Game idea can rest for a while in your dusty things-i-was-extremly-excited-about box, untill you finally see a perfect method described online somewhere how to make a start on it while you were looking up a completly unrelated bug in your automatic-neigborhood-cat-fur-pattern-vs-territory-size-arduino-detector-correclation-grapher. I love number six. I've definitely imagined the interviews I'll have once I get famous for my own amazing idea!  Yup, sounds very familiar! ;_; Write your ideas down but prioritize what you actually need to do first to have a stable income.  I feel the EXACT same way lol. I have all these things I wanna accomplish, all of these things I wanna do, but....NOPE, I never do 'em lol XD

One day, one day!  I've recently gotten into knitting.  So far I've completed one super janky blanket.  I love this blanket.  It's odd and uneven, but I made it.

I'm working on another blanket, and I have 3/4's of a dress finished...and one of my friends just asked me to make something for her.  So now my anxiety is up about knitting and I don't want to finish anything.  This sounds like me. The plus side is that you are constantly learning when you pursue these different avenues. I have found that I am knowledgable about some surprising careers/hobbies due to my ADHD. Agreed. I find it nice to just surround yourself with things you want to work on, so that you can always bounce between those. For example, I'm studying anatomy, perspective, and just overall drawing at the same time, and always keep books on those subjects disorganized so that I never get the urge to waste my time on something stupid whenever I get bored of one thing. I also keep all my new albums that I'm too restless to sit down and listen to with my favorite albums that I know I'll love. So far the strategy has worked for me. While I've had phases of poetry, world building, book writing, and sculpture all in the past month, in the end I've been spending a lot more time on what I need to spend time on, like the drawing stuff. So it seems to be working for me. This book looks great. Thanks for recommending it!  Just put all your savings into S&P 500 ETFs and you should be fine.

 Lol, I am working on 2 sweater, stopped because school started, and also wondering if I should start a scarf, since that's easier to knit. Of course, I have a big huge box full of yarn for projects that I thought would be fun, but never quite started/finished because I got bored... I've watched a few of the based pharma Lord's videos, I know a decent amount of knowledge about derivatives too, but N gas and AMD fucked me hard AMD has only recently fallen by a bit, if you got in a while ago it's not that bad. You probably should have cashed our right before Ryzen though. 

Natural gas though, damn. My friend got $25k from it last year and was lucky enough to sell before it plunged.
