How I lay out my weekly planner. Share yours? Hi guys. I was just writing in my planner and thought maybe some could benefit from seeing mine! I know it won't work for everyone but maybe someone will like it :) 

I use a moleskine weekly planner. I love it because it has the week on the left page, then a lined page on the right. I write homework assignments and due dates, bills due, my girlfriend's basketball games, days that I work that deviate from my normal schedule, etc in the days. 

On the lined page I write a Weekly Goals list at the top of the page. I try to get all the weekly goals done throughout the week, hopefully leaving none by the beginning of the next week (but I always have a few things left over, ugh haha). Then I write daily To Do lists next to each day. I also use any blank space for short grocery lists (like things I wouldn't normally get at the store) or any other notes.

This semester I have all online classes and I do my homework from the couch, so I always leave my planner on the coffee table so I can look at it each day and see what I need to do. Last semester I carried it in my bag with me every day so I could write down due dates for homework.

Let me know if you have any questions. If you have planner layouts I'd like to see those too! Actually maybe someone can help me with this. I have the calendar thing down, it is just the to-do lists that I can't figure out.

### My Calendar - What I do well

(alternate title for this section was My Calendar... Or how I learned to stop worrying and love Google)

Here is my calendar: http://imgur.com/sCtGtvF
 
I live by my google calendar. It is synced to my phone, so that way it is always on me and I can always check or update it. It is color coded:  

* **Red** - classes
* **Green** - Work/club. I work as an outdoor guide and am in a student outing club. I lump them together as there is a lot of crossover, so it makes sense to.
* **Peach-ish** - Senior design. It might be a 'class', but it is a whole nother beast. It gets its own color.
* **Yellow** - general stuff like other clubs, hanging out with friends, etc.
* **Grey** - either I haven't gotten to organizing it yet, or don't care.
* **Purple** - Homework. Every event on this calendar is an 'all-day' event. That way whether looking on my phone or computer, the event is always at the top. It lists homework assignments and exams. It is a life saver.
* **Brown** (not pictured) - Office hours. At the beginning of the semester I try to make a calendar of my professor's office hours so I can easily overlay it with mine. It lets me see at a glance when I can meet with them. (though they usually also have a 'by appointment' option too.)

Text message alerts have been an invaluable feature of Google Calendar. On Monday I had a doctor's appointment at 9am I forgot about. At 8am while I was making breakfast I got the text reminding me to go at 9.

### To Do lists - What I haven't quite figured out

To Do lists. They are the death of me. A couple years ago I tried google tasks. I also tried my phone's reminder app. I try paper and pen to do lists all the time. They get lost or forgotten about quicker than i can make them. I tried the app [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/), and it was probably the one I liked the best, but still not my thing. I really *really* wish it had subtasks. I like breaking down projects into subtasks. When I would list things out on it (or the native iPhone app or google tasks) it would be one big disorganized mess. Not only that, but I had a tendency to lose track of everything on the massive list.

At the moment I use Evernote and just have a to-do list note. This is ok, but I can't set reminders per item. I can for a whole note, but I am not going to create 50 notes with one thing each. That is even more messy. It works ok, but I still often forget to check it and lose track of things. I also still use the iphone reminder app a bit since I can set alerts. The ability to set alerts is one of the most important features to me.

Any ideas on how to nail down this to-do list thing? (Seriously, if RTM had sub-tasks/a better way of organizing things besides tags, priority1, priority2, etc. I would be set)

EDIT: formatting I really like the Moleskin stuff...but I have such a hard time with writing in notebooks that don't have a spiral spine. This probably isn't something I should be getting hung up on. ...I resort to a bunch of loose pieces of 8x11 paper...like a crazy person. Siri's my homegirl, I just say 'Reminder for 11AM tomorrow buy birthday card', shit's amazing The planner is nice, it's simple and effective which is what matters. I like how each day's section is small enough to allow you to see the rest of the week.

I've tried in the past to make one, but then I just end up putting that off too. Recently, as an alternative I've been setting reminders on my iPhone. I'll set the reminder 30 minutes before the certain thing that I have to do and review my upcoming reminders every day. If I can ever get around to it I'd love to try something a bit more structured.

 I've been using this planner for several years: http://www.amazon.com/bloom-Calendar-Planner-Organizer-December/dp/B00AYZYSBS/ref=pd_sbs_op_3

It has kind of silly girly things in it like fashion advice and inspirational quotes, but the reason I buy it is for the layout. It's got a full month view for each month and a large space for each day so I can write a to-do list every day as well as filling in appointments, etc. I started using a similar planner in middle school when it was required by my school, and ever since it's been EXTREMELY helpful. Like if I can't find my planner I freak out because I will DEFINITELY forget everything I have to do for the day. I am a guy, we cannot have daily planners and crap like that because we dont have purses to put them into. I just keep notes in Evernote app on my phone. Could not function without my phone.

I set up alerts/reminders/multi reminders for every fucking thing.Appointments, errands, meetings; it's all automated so my brain is freed up to spin as usual, but at least my basic stuff gets done.

I treat myself pretty much like someone with Alzheimer's. If it needs to be remembered- it MUST go in phone calendar. I have a large white board for long term stuff (clean gutters, car smogged) and little white board too for daily TODO lists, but shopping lists are also kept under phone "Reminder" section, dividend by category (Hardware, Grocery, Clothing etc.) so when I find myself at that particular store I actually have my list with me.

Automate EVERYTHING, especially repeating stuff. 

Mon. 8AM *Beep -go to dry cleaners.

Tue. 7PM *Beep -Take out trash the night before instead of scrambling at 5AM because you forgot.

Wed. 6PM *Beep -Water plants so they don't die like all the rest.

Thurs. 8PM *Beep - Do laundry and lay out workout clothes so you don't blow it off Fri. morning.
 I keep a couple of months of printed-out calendar in the area where I keep my purse/keys/wallet,etc, so that I can reality check my timeline.

I use my smart phone for the day-to-day stuff, but the calendars help me see "what day I'm on" and what's coming up soon. You know. Reality check. You and me both, friend. I found this post from last year http://redd.it/z77mt. 

I wish I could give you a breakdown of which ones I liked/disliked and why but I'm still trying to figure out exactly what I need. Hope the link is at least helpful :) I use 'Google Now'. I like that j can take pictures of things as well as make lists and it comes with voice recognition so there is less time taken to write the note. It also has location awareness and there are a lot of tricky things you can do with that.  > I have such a hard time with writing in notebooks that don't have a spiral spine. 

Hello bizarro-me. Spiral notebooks are probably my least favorite thing I have ever had the displeasure to write in. Loose leaf + binders or Moleskin-binding type all the way!

On a more constructive note, if you like notebooks with a spiral spine why not just use something like [this](http://www.officemax.com/office-supplies/notebooks-pads/spiral-notebooks/product-ARS24822?R=21185691&ssp=true) or [this](http://www.officemax.com/office-supplies/notebooks-pads/spiral-notebooks/product-ARS24822)? Oooh! You would probably enjoy Planner Pad. I'll post a pic of mine later when I'm not on mobile. I swear by it.  That's the one I have.  :) different design but I love it!  I'm female, and refuse to carry a giant carry-on bag as a purse. Totally with you there! Yep. I love that reminder feature. It saves my bacon.

10:15 *Beep - get ready to go to the doctors
10:45 *Beep - you should be leaving, now

I haven't burned the dinner bread or cookies ever since I got a smart phone. It's easier to give Siri a command to set the timer for 2 minutes than it is to use a kitchen timer. Thanks! I'll have to look into those. I can't express how frustrating RTM was for me because it had everything I wanted in a to-do app. It synced with my computer and an online account, it was on my phone, it had alerts and reminders (hell it could even have those based on where you were!). But the 3-priority and tag system was just not enough. I could not get it organized. It always turned into some gigantic list of hundreds of things that was impossible to parse easily. I really wanted to like RTM, but without sub-tasks it always becomes hard for me to use. Hence why I am 'limping along' with Evernote and the iphone reminders. The iphone reminders let me set alerts individually and I can create as many bullet points and sub-bullet points in Evernote as I want. Could you go more into that? When you say Google, do you mean Google Tasks? (Last time I used Google Tasks was probably 2011 ish) Omg! Yes the timer! I use that (no joke) probably 20+ times a day. I'm "time-blind" so I couldn't function without it. Ugh, its frustrating trying to go from one app to another just to stay on track. Makes me feel less organized and I end up being hard on myself for not remembering which app is for what. I even tried Ifttt (If This Then That) but I couldn't find a recipe that would do what I needed it to do. The comments and blogs that I read about what Ifttt offers don't match the possibilities available utilizing the service, but it's there. Right now the only recipe I use is whenever I save a post in reddit, Ifttt automatically creates a note in an Evernote notebook with the title of the post and a link to it. I do this because I forget to look at my saved posts here but I use Evernote daily. The only thing I don't like about this is I can't make a recipe with more stipulations. So, I can't save a post from r/ADHD and save another post from r/xxfitness and have them go to separate notebooks in Evernote... they're all lumped into one.  No, sorry I meant Google Keep. Its an app for the phone. I confused it with Google Now, another application.  ahh ok. I have never heard of either of those. I will look into them. Thanks!
