Need help finding a desktop/browser based alarm (plus update on things that are working for me) **Help needed:**  I am typically at the office 9 hours a day and need to bill 6 of those hours to clients. (I'm sure I don't have to tell you how difficult it is to have a 67% efficiency rate at a desk job.)

I could really use some kind of alarm or notification that basically pops up on my computer screen every half hour with a message along the lines of "Are you working right now?" to remind me to work. I have no concept of time whatsoever and am frequently shocked to discover that it's 3pm in the afternoon and I haven't done much of anything, and by that time it's too late to meet my hours. 

I tried searching but most recommendations were for phone apps. It **cannot** be an app on my phone. I cannot be trusted. And I'd rather not use Outlook for this. Any ideas?

**Things that are currently working for me in case it's useful to any of you:**

* *MS Outlook tasks:* I have not "lost" an email requiring a response by a deadline since I started flagging them with due dates. I also have daily reminders to print emails from the previous day, and to fill out my time sheet for the current day. These reminders have kept my email printing current and my time sheet for last month is 90% done. I have *never* been able to achieve this and regularly made myself ill pulling all nighters to put my time sheet together at the last possible minute. This seems really obvious but for some reason I wasn't understanding how the flagging system works.

* *Toggl.com*: I've tried toggl before but it didn't work for me until (1) I hit rock bottom and (2) I programmed in projects and clients. Toggl makes putting my time sheet together every day a breeze because now that I'm using it consistently, it eliminates my time-warp problem. I don't have to estimate how long I spent on a task.

* *Google Keep* :  Now that I've figured out how to use the voice activated things, I'm not forgetting the random things that pop in my head when I don't have anything to write them down. GPS based reminders are amazing.

* *Consolidating*: I moved grocery lists and calendars from Cozi to Google Calendar and Google Keep, shared what lists needed to be shared with my husband, and synced my outlook calendar to Google, so I only have one calendar to look at on my phone instead of three (I was keeping work and personal calendars separate. Bad idea).

* *Passion Planner*: I will be transitioning away from this over time to consolidate, but it has the best layout of printed planners that I have seen. Having prioritized personal and work to do lists for each week, blank spots for whatever, and the day broken down into half hour increments is amazing. If you work better on paper, check it out. There's an undated version so you can start using it at any time during the year without wasting pages.

* *FocusON App for android*: Because I cannot be trusted with access to my phone, I have FocusON set to disable all social media apps and browsers from 7:30am-1:00pm and 2:00pm-5:30pm on work days. It doesn't help with all of my phone issues but it's a huge start.  Initial thought is a watch set to beep/buzz every 15 30 mins or hour, I had adhd friends as kids who did this, and one I'm 99 percent sure still does as an adult, it's always on him and just gives him the cue so he knows another hour has gone by.  It doesn't necessarily help keep him on task just knowing how long he has been off task.  I'm sure there is software for PC that can accomplish this more or less, I'm guessing what you really want would be like an alert noise, and a splash screen to flash on the screen for a second to grab your attention.  Might disrupt your flow but 30 or 1hr wouldn't be too bad.  .... I'm going to look around for something.  If not this is going on my list of ''potential beginner coding projects''

Edit ; your post finally convinced me to stop being so loyal to the Samsung S note app and give Google keep a try. I absolutely LOVE Google Keep. I should start leaving GPS on too, didn't know it could remind you that way as well. And voice. My untrained computer skill impaired self says make an old fashioned power point presentation with motivation words pix of choice  There are definitely some chrome extensions that do this.  I don't remember specifically what they're call off hand. I have a fitbit and never considered this approach. I now have eight alarms that will make my wrist buzz. We'll see how it goes!
