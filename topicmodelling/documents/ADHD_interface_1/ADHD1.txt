I thought that, by my mom buying me some bins and a garbage can, I can finally keep my room clean once and for all. Now it appears to be the same way it was. I told her "yeah if only I had a bin to put my dirty clothes in I'll keep my room clean". But it's still a mess. When I finally get home from a tiring day I have no energy to neatly put my stuff on a hanger or sort them back to where I got them from. I just dump it somewhere. I wish I can be organized all the time It's only going to get worse once you get a place of your own. Try getting organized on a weekend or on days off. Play some music and try getting into the groove. It helps your brain to see a clean room. Or at least a tidy room. A messy environment adds to feelings of depression at our own detriment. [this has helped me a ton!](http://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com)  I love browsing all kinds of handy organisational products online. Boxes, bags, shelves, stationary holders, labelling tools, if only I had this set of tupperware, I'd be sure to keep my groceries organized, if only I had that bag, I'd always carry everything I need with me.

I keep trying to use my bujo, tried elaborate layouts, tried barebones layouts, doesn't change the fact that I don't use it.

Nope. "Good job on setting this up, now forget about it using it." The bins help though. 

Where are the bins if I can ask? I found a lot of help out of having tall upright ones (to avoid cats) with no lids, and having one in the bathroom or bedroom exposed and not in a closet. 

I need them to be mindlessly easy to put away.  There's a clothes bin in my room and a small garbage bin next to the door. But when it gets full that's when I start getting all types of lazy lol
