My younger brother is suffering greatly from motivation issues ... mom won't do anything ... any advice? TL;DR near the end Hello, everybody. I've been lurking for a while and I gotta say the people here are wonderful, I've gained a lot of insight on myself. However I'm lost in regards to my family. Maybe someone here can give me advice or at least some input, I'd be grateful. This been worrying me for too long. I may be a bit exhaustive but every detail I share is mportant. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'll write a tl;dr at the end.

To begin with, I live with my mom, I support her and my brother but I have school and a job so I can't be here 24/7. It has been half a year since my ADHD diagnosis and I've been dealing with it effectively, with fantastic support from my friends no less. I have a brother six years younger than I and he is currently in high school. At his age, I lacked self-awareness and I was always in a bad mood, though not to the point of anti-social behavior. I was smart but methodical with everything I did and that translated to a sluggish learning pace. I was misinterpreted as being 'slow'—much in the same way as one might say about a mentally deficient person, to put it politely. I was also not articulate, I could not understand and express myself correctly. Any trouble I had went unnoticed by the school and I'm pretty sour about that. It was obvious that I needed help. Anyway, a few times I mustered up some form of hope, and asked my parents if there was something wrong with me. They assured me I was just lazy, my problems were normal for everybody, and emphasized that I needed to grow up and try harder. I believed it to be true and I felt hopeless, I didn't want to make any effort to better myself. I withdrew myself from the outside world and succumbed to video games and the internet as an escape.

Time seemed to stand still, nothing changed, until this year when I was diagnosed and I began a transformation. I became a very responsible and loyal person, eager to do hard work and help my friends and family with anything. But the first and most important aspect of my change was that I was finally aware of all my problems and was able to figure out how to fix them. Since then, I've been growing at a steady pace. I can say without a doubt that my diagnosis has been the single most important event of my life thus far. This brings me to my brother. As I mentioned in the title, he is exhibiting the same behavior I once did. He isn't really aware of his negative attitude and as a result doesn't have many friends. He's always in a depressed mood, it seems worse than I ever was. He gives up too easily as well, whenever anything is even a slight challenge. He is too dependent on our mother, that's our only difference. I was doing everything myself at a young age. I won't get into details because it isn't my place, but he is coddled like a baby and it had lead to a toxic entitlement from him. He expects everything he wants to be given to him. He expects everything to be solved for him. The most unhealthy aspect of that is any time he is questioned, no matter how mundane, he quickly claims lack of knowledge.

"I don't know," is his answer to everything because he refuses to think, even for a moment, especially if he isn't under pressure. Even with the simplest of concepts it seems like he he doesn't use his brain. I'm not trying to mock him or be mean, I just need to demonstrate how severe it is. Here's an example. I got a new desk and had the opportunity to change the layout of it so that I have privacy. My brother and I share a computer room and everyone has to pass through to get to other parts of the house. His computer screen is in view as you enter. Although he doesn't look at anything inappropriate he still deserves privacy. So, he was jealous of my layout and expressed that to me. I told him if he wanted to move his desk he needed to do it himself. It isn't hard at all, it's just a mess and he needs to clean up before anything else. His first excuse was that he wouldn't be able to do it because it is too hard, and he needed me to help him. I suggested he try the easiest things to start with and immediately he refused. When I asked why, he stared blankly for a only few seconds and then answered with, "I don't know." I asked if he even put any thought into the question and again, with the same gaze he answered, "I don't know." I paced myself so as not to get frustrated. I explained that I wouldn't give him the answer to everything and that he needs to actually put in some thought. As I waited, his vacant expression tested my patience. He didn't acknowledge me after a minute, so I asked him if he was listening. He proved that he was by reciting what I told him, so I had faith he was just thinking. I asked if he had an answer to any of my questions. Can you guess what happened next?

This is a serious problem and I assume it stems from his lack of motivation but also from the atmosphere he is provided with. Our mom coddles him like a baby every day even though he is in high school. She recognizes that she shouldn't, that she should stop, but hasn't changed whatsoever. I am the only person encouraging him to be independent. I know very well how hard it is to have no motivation though, from anywhere, be it internal or external. I am trying to be patient with my brother but it's been an arduous trial for me. Sometimes I make him feel bad which I instantly regret and apologize for. I feel like when I do that I'm mirroring that same lack of empathy my parents displayed when I was younger. I've been spending as much time as I can helping him hands-on with school and chores. I always give him a chance to learn and improve. I never reveal the answer, I force him to think, to use his brain. But I haven't made any progress so far.

I try so hard but I'm only human, I have needs and I can't dedicate all my time to him. With all this in mind, here is the BIG ISSUE.

Mom's extremely impressed with how much I've changed following my diagnosis and treatment. She's far less stressed out because I help her everyday, which I didn't do before. There's much less burden on her now and she recognizes it. Regarding that, I've been pondering whether or not my brother has ADHD. I've put a lot of time into researching ADHD for my own vices. I once read that it is hereditary with a high chance to be passed down—an 87% chance if I recall correctly. But that's not my only reasoning. He suffers from everything I did, motivation most importantly but also concentration. That's what makes me so sure, and so afraid. I love my brother more than anyone could know so I've been hounding our mom to get him help from a specialist. At first she refused to even listen to me. She didn't think he has it but eventually I got her to see my perspective and she agreed to do something about it. 

It's been two weeks now, she hasn't been busy AT ALL yet has made no attempt to follow up on her promise. I went through it with her just a few days ago and I learned the process is actually very simple. I don't know if I am nagging too much or too little? She also thinks nothing will come out of it, because years ago the school had these specialists ask him a series of questions. She says they would have known if he has ADHD. I think that is wrong and a grave mistake to make, as he goes to the SAME SCHOOL I DID. I'm afraid the school's knowledge on the subject of ADHD might not be up to date. And if that is the case, then how could they provide an accurate diagnosis? This is what my mother doesn't understand. I also think she doesn't realize how detrimental ADHD can be, too. I know there are some that deal with it just fine without any medication or even any help, and that's great. I was unfortunate to be affected heavily and suffer during adolescence. But my brother is still young, he can enter adulthood with the help he needs and deserves!

tl;dr my younger brother in high school might have ADHD, I know because I see my past in him. My mother doesn't, and feels it isn't worth the effort to get him checked out. I help him every day to better himself but I can't spend all of my time doing so and I believe he'd be better off with medicinal treatment anyway. My brother has severe entitlement issues and I think getting treated could allow him the motivation he needs to be independent. I'm afraid the school he attends could be ignorant on the subject of ADHD

So my questions would be the following: Does it sound like my brother may have ADHD? Should we trust the school faculty to accurately diagnose him? Would we be better off with a private doctor? The school is public so they hire government workers. Not that anything is wrong with that, I'm just afraid they don't have enough funding and don't care, you know? Does anyone share a similar experience to me? What are some ways to help my brother with his dependence? What are some ways to help my mother understand the severity of all this? Am I wrong in anything I'm doing or thinking?

I sincerely thank you all for taking the time to read, it means a lot to me. I'd love to hear what any of you have to say, no matter how bluntly honest you have to be. I appreciate honesty, so don't be afraid to hurt my feelings. Cheers. > Anyway, a few times I mustered up some form of hope, and asked my parents if there was something wrong with me. They assured me I was just lazy, my problems were normal for everybody, and emphasized that I needed to grow up and try harder. 

I'm sure your parents were doing the best they could. Without knowledge of ADHD, they simply didn't understand it was a possible issue. Y'know? BTW, I had the same experience with my parents. 

> It's been two weeks now, she hasn't been busy AT ALL yet has made no attempt to follow up on her promise.

Maybe you can drive this thing? If you're over 18, I believe you can represent your brother as far as the documents at the office go. Do you have a copy of the insurance card? If you do, you should be able to do this. You'll need to take him there, and wait. Assuming he wants to do this.

> She says they would have known if he has ADHD.

Not true. They are not experts. They look for signs, and maybe they were distracted by his low self esteem. Whatever the cause was, they easily could have missed it.

> Does it sound like my brother may have ADHD? 

Possibly. 

> Should we trust the school faculty to accurately diagnose him? 

No. Don't be upset with them. It's a public school, and they're doing the best they can. It's more than when I was in school. They also don't have as much time as a professional. They're really there to identify potential issues.

> Would we be better off with a private doctor? 

Yes. A psychiatrist. Your family doctor can refer him. You may also want to contact the insurance company on the phone, and see if you can take him directly to a psychiatrist. I'm guessing you'll need a referral though.

> The school is public so they hire government workers. Not that anything is wrong with that, I'm just afraid they don't have enough funding and don't care, you know? 

Yes. I don't think it's a matter of not caring. It's a matter of not being as educated as a doctor.

> Does anyone share a similar experience to me? 

With a sibling, no. But I was an unhappy "lazy" kid in school. It also took me until my early 20s to wake up. Maybe that's the case with him. 

> What are some ways to help my brother with his dependence? 

He's still a kid. You need to balance that with your expectations. Maybe find a hobby that he's good at? Something that will get him off his butt, and probably build up some self confidence. 

> What are some ways to help my mother understand the severity of all this? 

Explain to her about how ADHD is genetic, and that you have it. If you're helping your mom pay the bills, she may have it. Beg them to have themselves tested. Don't be rude about it. Do it nicely and passionately. 

> Am I wrong in anything I'm doing or thinking?

I think you're doing okay considering the situation that you're in. *Keep in mind* that ultimately it's their lives. They will live it they way they want. By all means keep asking them to see a professional. Explain that they have all of the symptoms that you do. Maybe eventually they'll go get tested to shut you up (in a good way of course). Good afternoon, thank you for the quick and well-written response. 

I know I seemed like I harbor a grudge towards my parents, but I do not. I should have stated that, that's my bad. I know it wasn't their fault. We were victims of the times. I only mentioned it to point out that saying is easier than doing, and at the time, they didn't recognize how hard it was for me to **do**.

> Maybe you can drive this thing? If you're over 18, I believe you can represent your brother as far as the documents at the office go. Do you have a copy of the insurance card? If you do, you should be able to do this. You'll need to take him there, and wait. Assuming he wants to do this.

I don't know if I can do anything regarding my brother's healthcare either, he is still a minor and I am not a legal guardian, I don't think. I don't know anything about the technicalities in this situation, and I don't want to disrespect my mother. I revere her and love her very much, I would never do or say anything unkind to her. Further, as you may understand, my brother is young and immature. I don't think he'd grasp how important seeing the doctor would be, and be reluctant to do it.

In regards to the family doctor suggestion, we do have one, and that's actually where I began with my diagnosis. However, he is an elderly man who is very traditional in his views. When I talked to him he was very hasty and dismissive. I don't blame him, though, he wasn't mean about it he genuinely cared. I know the stigma against ADHD is the cause. He gave me a referral but not a specific one. He just said that I need to see a psychiatrist for any further assistance. Is that normal?

You say you were "lazy" and stopped being that way in your early 20's. The same exact thing happened to me at the same time of my life. It's what lead to my diagnosis. I believe it was purely from my inability to motivate myself. If that is because of depression, and treating ADHD also treated the depression, then that would explain my instant and extreme improvement. That's why I'm so vehement about getting my brother checked, I don't think he's lazy on purpose, just that his brain won't let him **want** to do hard work. You are right to mention my expectations too. At his age I was a lot different in relation to independence and I realize that would cloud my judgement. That is a hard disposition to get past and I don't know if that would be right either.

> Explain to her about how ADHD is genetic, and that you have it. If you're helping your mom pay the bills, she may have it. Beg them to have themselves tested. Don't be rude about it. Do it nicely and passionately.

I think my father has it actually but my mother could as well. I can't really pinpoint it in either of them, I only know that my dad suffers from a lot of disabilities of the mind and ADHD would explain it all easily. I feel like it isn't my place to say such things to them, though. Also, my mother knows I have it, and she recognizes how important getting treated was for me. She's directly seen how much I've changed. Which is why it's so bizarre that she doesn't share any enthusiasm for my brother. There is probably a hidden reason to it. 

I noticed in your tag that you're a parent. Would you mind if I PM'd you a few short things regarding my brother? I don't want to share it publicly but I trust that you as a parent would understand me. No big deal if that's inappropriate, sorry for being a nuisance if that is so.

Anyhow, thank you for the insight. I suppose the school is something thing you'd be correct in saying that I hold a grudge for, heh. I should be more tolerant, you're right that they are trying their best and they care. I also didn't think about how they could be distracted by something else and miss ADHD. That's very useful, I'll share that with my mother. It's their lives and yes, I know it's up to them. I would never want anything to be forced upon me if I didn't want it, even if it was good for me. I'm not trying to be forceful, just reasonable. Have a good day. > I know I seemed like I harbor a grudge towards my parents, but I do not. I should have stated that, that's my bad. 

Nah it's all good, man. I wasn't sure if you did or not. No worries.

> I don't know if I can do anything regarding my brother's healthcare either.

Good point. Thinking about it, you won't be able to do it. They need a guardians signature.

> In regards to the family doctor suggestion, we do have one, and that's actually where I began with my diagnosis. However, he is an elderly man who is very traditional in his views. 

*Sigh*. Yeah. Decades ago there wasn't a lot of understanding. Most doctors dismissed it as kids being lazy. Similarly to how they treated people with autism. Modern medicine acknowledges it's a real thing. Unfortunately this view hasn't really changed much with older doctors. Not surprisingly, insurance companies point to this thinking, and often use it as an excuse not to cover ADHD medication.

> I think my father has it actually but my mother could as well. I can't really pinpoint it in either of them, I only know that my dad suffers from a lot of disabilities of the mind and ADHD would explain it all easily. 

> I don't have the statistics handy, but over half of the people with ADHD also have some other mental disorder. You know the symptoms. If you think he has it, he probably does. If he's already seeing a doctor for his prescriptions, you may want to suggest that he gets tested for ADHD. Then again, he may be harboring those negative feelings towards ADHD.

> I feel like it isn't my place to say such things to them, though. Also, my mother knows I have it, and she recognizes how important getting treated was for me. She's directly seen how much I've changed. Which is why it's so bizarre that she doesn't share any enthusiasm for my brother. There is probably a hidden reason to it.

It isn't your place? You know your family a lot more than I do. However, if one of my family was having a big problem that could be fixed, I would share my information on what I think it was. Is there a way you can kindly bring it up? 

> I noticed in your tag that you're a parent. Would you mind if I PM'd you a few short things regarding my brother? 

Please feel free to PM me. Happy to help. I should point out that my kids are not in HS yet. My opinion will lack personal experience as an actual parent of someone in HS.
