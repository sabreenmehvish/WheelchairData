After two weeks of using Carrot, a todo app for iOS, I thought I would give it a review for everyone here. Hey everyone, a week and a half ago [This app](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1pbg60/this_is_a_todo_app_that_works/) showed up and we discussed it a bit, I decided to download it and try it out, since I can't ever keep track of everything I am doing. 

So far, after a week and a half of solid use, I can say that this apps really works for me. The interface is solid and everything is simple and intuitive. But that isn't why it is such a great app for people with ADHD.  The reason it is so great is that you get points, levels and rewards for everything that you complete. It gives you more than just a reminder to do your shit, it gives you that little boost of motivation. 

Of course, you have to enjoy the little things it gives you, if not, this app is just like any other app. But I have come to really enjoy the personality that the app has and the little rewards. 

Another thing that I really have come to like is that over time, more functionality is added to the app. Originally, I wasn't even able to rearrange my tasks or even edit them if I misspelled them. But as you level up more things become available to you. 

The last great thing I want to highlight on is the mood usage. The app has a conscious and it keeps track of how often you complete tasks, it won't just sit there being idle if you don't finish anything during the day. It gets mad at you, it sends you push notifications if you don't finish anything, and the screen will change colors, and it will just mess with you until you finish enough tasks to make her happy. 

The cat-cam is also really funny. It's another little thing that i enjoy. There is just so much more that I can pull out, like [Recognizing certain tasks and making little jokes](http://imgur.com/3FI1NqA), or making you do little minigames when you finish a task to get more points. There is a lot to this app that makes it really great. [I also laughed when I got this](http://imgur.com/L1qpa6M)

So in conclusion, after 9 days using Carrot, I have found a very useful app that replaces any other todo app I had before because of it's simple RPG elements, moods of the app, and the depth of the app. It is more than just a to-do app, it's that personal assistant that reminds you to get your shit done. Just bought it. So exited to use it and I never lose my iPhone so it's something I feel is going to be a big part of my life.
