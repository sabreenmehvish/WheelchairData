G'day to all you fine fellow wandering minds! I've been lurking this sub-reddit since I started to strongly suspect this is what has been troubling me all my life, unknowingly. Thankfully the information I've come across helped push me towards getting a formal diagnosis and beginning treatment - but since then I've been stuck in a rut of mixed emotions ranging from having a late diagnosis and trying to find proper therapeutic methods of dealing with my condition. 

***As far as therapy and medication goes***; I've been seeing a psychotherapist since I was diagnosed about 6 months ago, and have also been prescribed 3 different stimulant medication by my family doctor. ***(I'm a rather poor self-observer so take the below information with a grain of salt)***  First one being Vyvanse; Which I was on for about 3 months, ending at 70mg daily - It was difficult for me to tell if it was working as intended, or not at all with no side effects to report. 

Next I was put on Concerta for about a month, ending at 54mg and abruptly stopping as I felt it aggravated many of my symptoms and felt worse on it. Following that, we decided on Adderall XR, starting at 40mg for a month; While I'm pretty sure for about the first 2 or 3 weeks it was working, and working great ***(a few examples being; I was able to get through two books on ADHD, and actually retain a lot of the information which I've NEVER been able to do. My mind usually just wanders mid-sentence, my eyes frantically jump around pages, and I have to read sentences over and over again with no comprehension. Also noticed it was easier to talk to people, and express myself, along with not finishing people's sentences as often or talking over them. Most noticeably I was able to hyperfocus and constantly keep myself productive and on task at work, considering having many distractions (manual labor in a precast concrete plant) )*** with the exception being that it made me feel rather fatigued mentally, but the endless amount of physical energy remain ...  until it wore off 5 hours later and my "normal" me would come back full swing, with a heavy wave of sleepiness ***(but still too restless to fall asleep)*** and depression/irritability. So my doctor added in an afternoon dose of 30mg, which I feel was helping me get through the last half of work and staying productive but by the time I finished work and got into my car, the  mental crash begins in full swing  ***(chronically dangerous habit of excessive speeding, reckless driving while being highly distractible)*** 

Flash forward to present moment, recently prescribed what I think is a monstrous dose of 110mg XR ***(subjective data on efficacy of medication but I'm a 23 year old male standing at 6"5 and 300lbs with a wide stocky frame)*** spread out through out the day, I don't really notice any difference, with the same side effects to note as before, but with an unrelenting sense of fatigue and mental crash that seems to last from the time I wake up ***(before meds, and after meds)*** I'm starting to feel really hopeless at this point, I know it takes time to find effective treatment but having recently started on a good trajectory I feel myself steadily losing the will to keep moving forward

On that note, I guess I'm looking for any pointers or insight with regards to what concoction of meds, strategies, habits, etc that might be beneficial for me that I'm not already doing; (I have a very fast paced, physically demanding and strenuous job for 50hrs/wk, while also getting in 5 lifts/wk in the gym, seeing a psychotherapist twice a month that specializes in CBT and ADHD, pretty much refrain completely from playing video games as I have no self-control and 12 hrs on a regular basis easily flies by, following a relatively strict diet high in protein, healthy fats, with adequate water intake, and no sugar or processed foods, daily cold showers, Also; I try to my best to keep a consistent schedule ***(alarm set for 4:30, and I try to be in bed by around 21:00)*** 

Since being diagnosed and trying to absorb all the information I can, I haven't felt the need to self-medicate with painkillers, cocaine, alcohol, and compulsive over-eating so that's really good, I feel there's still a lot of symptoms I'm struggling with whether my meds are working for some symptoms or not at all, but notably my executive functioning skills are severely handicapped, severe time-blindness, and my sleep;

 I'm far too restless at night with an overactive brain, and overactive body it results in it taking a long time for me to actually fall asleep. When I do fall asleep it doesn't seem to matter how little, or how much I sleep - I always wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all, and it takes a lot ton of effort to actually wake up on time .. I sleep like the living dead so I tend to need multiple very loud alarms on multiple devices in different places, and even them I either stupidly turn them off, forget to snooze, close my eyes for a second and wake up hours later. A lot of the time, when I do wake up - it takes me an insurmountable amount of time to physically get out of bed, followed by sluggishly dragging my feet around to get a move on. ***(as far back as I can remember my sleep/wake has always been this way, parents had extreme difficulties waking me up on time for school)***

&#x200B;

   ***For some deeply personal background information that may or may not be relevant;*** As far back as I can remember I've always had significant struggles in most aspects of my life ranging from living with different parents, and changing schools year-to-year as a child with a strict mother, step-sister and a bit of an emotionally/physically abusive, alcoholic, and gambling addicted step-father; To living with a father whom I've come to recently realize most likely suffers from a pre-dominantly inattentive form of ADD, I believe my struggles really began to appear when it was agreed that I move in with him longer-term, to a new country and city ***(at age 9 or 10)*** where for about less than a month my mother and father tried to work things out to my surprise .. came home from school one afternoon with a letter on the table, she had left with my sister to go back to my step-father ***(sister is half his kid)***.

 Anyways to sum this up as quickly as I can, when I started 6th grade I started to miss a lot of school ***(dad would leave before me in the morning)*** At one point I had missed a straight 2-3 weeks of school, staying home playing pc games till the school called him. Pretty sure I still missed a lot of school or classes following that moment, but I kept it on the DL more. By the start of 7th grade I was using my lunch money to buy drugs, started abusing opiates and anxiety medication - I never really felt that I fit in with the other kids always felt like an outcast and that I didn't belong, I was never able to really pay attention in class, was a class-clown and trouble maker. I was dyslexic and had another learning disability when I was younger, still might but never bothered to look into it more .. If it wasn't for being able to score high on tests and exams ***(on the exception of math)*** I would've failed out of school miserably - never finished in-class work, very rarely completed homework, pretty much never handed in completed projects. Anyways, by the time I got to high school, my freshman year I overdosed while in gym class on a mixture of xanax, whiskey, and vicodin. Living with a father that was never really "there" for me, from what I remember he wasn't overly phased by it. Got into a lot more trouble in high school, got myself involved with the wrong kinds of people and did a lot of stupid, reckless shit over that time. I overdosed again somewhere near the end of the 10th grade, this time on a mixture of oxy's and dilaudid and that was the last straw. 

Life with my father was probably the worst thing for an undiagnosed kid now that I think about it more; No structure, no guidance, no parental supervision, most day to day conversations were along the lines of "hi how was your day" and "good" I had free roam and was able to do what I wanted, on the exception that because I was feeding myself for the most part, I was pushing close to 350lbs of pure fat, no physical activity and lots of video games. 

So following the last time I OD'ed, I had to move back in with my mother, step-father, and sister. Life slowly got a bit more manageable I suppose, but going from no supervision to very strict hard-ass parents was pretty awful for me, plus side is the next few years I only drank and smoked pot. 

Started feeling like I was doing well considering ... then when I was around 18 I was started making decent money as a personal trainer while finishing up some courses I had failed in order to get my diploma ***(never walked on stage, prom, wasn't interested)*** parents started charging me absurd amounts of rent, so shortly after I was convinced to move in with my now ex-girlfriend and her family rent-free while I try to get a degree and focus on my life. I tried to go to college while working full time, I had an awful time .. constantly felt stupid and feelings of frustration started setting in that I could not direct my focus and concentrate on the needed material, so I kept trying, and I was trying hard but it just wasn't working. So I started socializing more and partying more, till I made another impulsive decision that required money and time so I dropped out. Her parents helped me get a loan of $10k from a bank to help pay for my school as neither of my parents could help me with the money, and refused to write a letter to help me get government assistance for tuition.

&#x200B;

Shortly after I dropped out my life started to really go downhill, and fast. I spent about $3k on tuition, and the rest of that loan on tons of shit, all impulsive buys while her parents constantly questioned where the money was going if I wasn't in school anymore, anyways  I ended up getting bored and felt vastly under-stimulated with that girlfriend. Quickly realized we just weren't a good match, but instead of doing the right thing I ended up cheating on her on various occasions with  girls from parties, clubs, and prostitutes. This went on for a while before I suggested we take a break ***(I was moving out with a roommate so felt it was a good time to see if a break would make things better)*** 

***With further regards to debts;*** So I'm about 19 or 20 at this point, parents helped me get a used car ***(although it was a shit box and I was sold a lemon)*** I appreciated my mom co-signing the loan for me. By this point I've easily racked up about $20-30k of my mom's debt.. impulsive buying with expensive taste is a recipe for disaster. So back to the break with that girlfriend, after the month she ended up breaking up with me where I actually had a revelation of feelings and wanted to make things work. Yeah, I deserved it at the end of the day but I was heavily devastated, having been with her for 3 years. Shortly after, I get offered a credit card with a $20k limit, 0% interest for 6 months - that's awesome right! fuck me was I wrong, as if I didn't rack up enough debt already. Literally maxed it out and went over the limit by the time the 3rd or 4th month rolled around, I'm fucked right? I've always worked at minimum 2 jobs at a time, but somehow never had any money outside of paying bills. So shortly after I get an opportunity to get a 3rd job, all in I thought I was making decent coin but who would've thought that working 90hrs a week wasn't even close to sustainable for a long period of time? Not me! I traded in that shitbox of a car and got myself into a brand new mid-grade sports car loan, total of $60k with the trade in. Does the spending end there?! Nope! Got injured at work, along with burning myself out I was fired from 2 of those jobs. One thing led to another and I was bouncing around from place to place living with friends, to short-term roommates, to sleeping in my car and living out of it. By the time I was 21 or 22 I had accumulated over $120k of PERSONAL debt, not counting what I owed to my mother. I was heavily pushed into declaring bankruptcy at 22, although I probably had no choice realistically. 

&#x200B;

In the middle of all the above fiasco, I ended up getting involved with a woman that was very very bad for me. Extremely toxic relationship, lots of bad deeds happened during this time. One of them being that she was heavy into abusing her prescriptions, and recreational drug use. At this point I've probably had upwards of 20-30 different jobs, where most of them I was fired for being chronically late, absent, or my temper would come out and I'd tell my supervisor to fuck off,  Another large percentage of those jobs were short-term, where I impulsively quit, or just abandoned completely ***(usually because I felt too anxious to call or show up)*** 

This was also the time period in my life where I started to use cocaine and speed .. followed by crack. All really dark times in my past and it's painful for me to write it down and see it in front of me, but that's the reality. However the use of the above drugs, along with a toxic relationship were the missing ingredients I needed in my life that led me to my diagnosis. I found it strange how neurotypical people acted on stimulants .. they almost acted how I act normally (fidgeting, excessive and fast talking, etc) where as I felt this wave of relaxation and fog dissipating feeling. I could actually focus on something that didn't interest me, would feel a weird urge of being able to sit completely still, and just want to stare at a wall. I could think clearly. While being able to sleep like a baby afterwards, felt no urge to do more, or excessive amounts "fiending" was non-existent for me, and I was able to eat right after a line. All very strange to me at the time so i started researching it. I feel it's important for me to note that since self-discovery and diagnosis, I no longer feel the need, or urge to abuse any kind of drug. I no longer compulsively self-medicate to ease my symptoms and cope with my world.

&#x200B;

Sooo I kinda lost my point there, or where I was really going with all of this so here's a summary for you;

&#x200B;

***TL;DR -*** at a really rough time in my life following a fairly recent diagnosis and discovery of ADHD-C, but feel extremely hopeless because I can't seem to find the proper medication and other forms of symptom alleviation. Doctor isn't a specialist in the field, so we usually sit down and research what the next best thing to try is. Have tried vyvanse, concerta, and now adderall xr currently at 110mg/day - still feels ineffective. Do I need to treat the depression, and possibly the anxiety along with a stimulant medication for the ADHD? Having accumulated asburd amounts of debt at a young age, and now being bankrupt with no options left for help ***(along with about $5k worth of PAY-DAY Loans accumulated shortly after bankruptcy and before diagnosis)*** how can I try to see the light at the end of the tunnel when I've been working dead-end, unsatisfying, un-stimulating jobs for years and barely making a dent in any of my debts while also having no money to have a somewhat pleasure-able quality of life? I'd like to go back to school and get myself into a more rewarding career but due to the debts, I'm fucked for loans for another 8 years and that feels like a  depressively long time to START my education and work these shit jobs that I can't seem to hold down for a reasonable length of time. I'm constantly playing catch up.. lose a job and have no money for a while, start a job, start slowly catching up on the necessities and then another fuck up and I'm back to a worse position. Most recently I've started working at a good company, while it's exhausting, and tough on my body - It's also pretty repetitive, and boring as fuck. While the pay and benefits are the best I've ever been able to land myself into I feel I won't last much longer there because of the way I've been feeling I have zero motivation to drag my ass to work. It's exhausting to even just get out of bed and get my day started lately which is fucking pathetic and sad, it's a basic human need. Everyone has to work and has financial obligations, etc.. I'm just really lost now, and I have no one to really turn to, as unfortunate as it is I've completely torched many of my friendships, familial relationships, etc. I'm carrying so much guilt and other emotions over my head I hardly feel the urge to fight on anymore. I don't know what my strengths or weaknesses are, or what my talents are. I feel light-years behind everyone I grew up with in every single aspect of life and I just feel like a shitty, talentless, unproductive, lazy, waste of space. 

My self esteem, confidence, and how I view myself is just atrocious, I have this dreading sense that I'll never be happy or succeed in any walks of life. ***(important to note that I don't feel suicidal, while sometimes I admit I feel the urge to slam my car into a highway barrier at full speed, I don't think I ever would, or I would've done so by now)*** my dream growing up and even into early adulthood was always to be in the military but I've always had something holding me back, whether it was a girlfriend, family never being supportive of it, fear of failing yet again and making a fool of myself. But now I'm on medication for ADHD-C, along with a major depression diagnosis and very likely anxiety as well - they'd never take a glimpse at my application due to the liabilities and medication. ***(have to be off for 1 year)*** I've already missed quite a few days having started at this job recently, along with being late a few times so I fear I will inevitably lose it within the coming days or weeks. I fear what happens next, will I be able to bounce back this time? After living in my car for the better part of 7 months, my mom convinced me to move back in till I get my feet on the ground - while I never wanted to, I knew it would make her happier and ease her stress not having to worry about me as much. Now with the way my finances are, and the fact that my step-father and I don't really get along (he fails to understand or acknowledge ADHD) and consistently puts me down when I'm already hard enough as it is on myself. I try to keep myself in check because there's no sense in arguing with him because he's incapable of taking anyone else's opinion but his own. But I can only bottle my emotions up for so long .. I know some parts of myself pretty well by now, and while sometimes I'm quite surprisingly patient ... other times I just can't and I snap, like full on rage ***(never violent)*** but a scary sight nevertheless and I don't want that to happen here because then I'm absolutely fucked beyond belief. Meanwhile since educating myself a lot about the disorder, I see a lot of ADHD traits in him, and my mom a mixture of both, like myself. My sister also has ADD, although diagnosed when she was younger she might have a better fighting chance at life than me, and I'll help make sure of that - but when her father fails to understand her struggles and undermines her like he did with me and still does, it drives me fucking insane. She's a teen and those are her crucial years imo.

 ***(For DSM criteria's sake which I think is bullshit and doesn't even come close to grasping the actual struggles we deal with; I was officially diagnosed at a place that specializes in CBT, and more specifically, Adult ADHD. 9/9 Inattentive, 7/9 Hyperactive/Impulsive, Major Depression. Costed me a little over $2k, and it took about 2-3 months of testings, appointments, and follow-ups before I could be recommended treatment with medication.)***

***\*I think I'll stop there, sorry for the endless ranting, but I've had these feelings and emotions locked in a cage and buried for a long while. I needed somewhere I could vent and seek any kind of insight, advice, or help from people with a similar brain to myself, because I feel myself slipping far from the ledge I somehow managed to haul myself over. I feel I'm at my wits end and I don't know how I feel about that.\****

&#x200B;

Thanks for your time, and patience. I apologize again for the very lengthy, and unorganized layout of this post.. my points are kind of spread out and all over the place, and I caught myself going on unnecessary rants but this is all a quick summary of my life, how it has played out and where I am now. If you did manage to read most of it, congratulations - your medication must be working for ya ;) I look forward to hearing from any of you, with whatever input you have to offer whether it be good or bad. I'll take it as best as I can, and with a grain of salt :)

&#x200B;

Until then, I'll take my therapists advice and take it one day at a time. Take care!

&#x200B;

\-EFD out I won't write a long comment, because I should be asleep already, but I want you to know that it's ok that things are this way. Just the fact that you are actually actively dealing with them by bringing them up like this, processing them by ranting and listing it all out, shows you're on something of a good track already. Sure, the hardship is probably not over yet, but you are slow but steady moving in the right direction, because you're working so hard to face your issues. That's impressive and will take you far.

One quote that has stayed with me through my own dark times: 
"If you're going through hell, keep going."
- Winston Churchill

Good luck, OP. I'm rooting for you! Thank you for your reassurance and kind words, I appreciate it.

Just stickied that note on my screen!
