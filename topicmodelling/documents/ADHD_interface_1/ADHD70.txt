Strattera log Hi all, I just took my first dose of straterra and figured I would make a log here showing my results, the side effects, the symptoms, etc.

Dosage : 40 MG

Taking : Doctor said once at night, after reading around I am deciding to do it in the morning to avoid the insomnia issue many have faced

Just took first 40mg capsule with a cup of coffee. 

Not sure how this log will work because the layout of reddit, but saw this over on the ADD forums and got a lot of enjoyment from reading other peoples ADHD med logs. So here's to hoping that straterra improves ADHD symptoms and is the proper boost I need Best of luck on your quest friend.  When I was on Strattera I was directed to take it in the morning. Update :
Took the drug 3 hours ago. Currently feel fine, but also had two cups of coffee.



Not sure if just me but my male reproductive organ has 'retracted' and become the size of an acorn. Very concerning, went into the bathroom to try to fix it and it seemd I was able to get it to stop doing that
Is that a normal symptom?




Other than that, feel kind of fine and normal. Had 2 cups of coffee + 40 mg of strattera. Feel slight warm feeling on right side under ribs.


Upvote this if possible so people can follow the story as it unfolds How are you doing? I didn't think anyone was following the thread since Reddit kicks older posts to the back pages, so thanks for asking


What happened :

Day 1, after I made my initial posts, I was hit with a WAVE of tiredness. The kind of tiredness I felt when I had strep throat, just wanted to sit on the couch, close my eyes and sleep. It was an extreme fatigue.

I knew that some people got tired on this drug, but this was debilitating. The thing is, I felt fine energy wise... UNTIL I ate

So after eating, my energy was finished. I spent three hours in a fog.

Well, that has made me question taking the drug TBH. I don't know if I can afford to go into a coma over using it. I think after reading on here and on the web, I'm going to steer away from a Strattera only regimen.ess

I am interested in possibly Strattera + Provigil to counter the effects, or if necessary, switching to a different medication How long did you take it?

I'm sitting here looking at teh bottle, realizing it cost about $500 and thinking if I should continue taking it(about to make a thread about it, ROFL)

Please share your experiences with Strattera! I don't want to skew your experience or persuade you in any way. But.. for me I had those effects. Possibly even some discharge. It was either 2 or 4 weeks idr. This was probably 6 years ago now. It was something my GP prescribed but eventually saw a psychiatrist. For some it works great and others it is terrible. I felt kind of drugged and disappointed. Well so much for me not influencing anything XD Nah I respect it bro, any experience helps!

Ty my friend! Take care You too!
