I hate ADD and only child syndrome. (Rant/Vent) We got married 3 years ago. I didn't understand ADD then as fully as I do now, and if I had, it would have been a very different event. My husband is also an only child, boarded for school, and a business owner, so compromise and accepting direction from others are his weakest points. I've taught him loads, but back then...

He broke my heart twice over the wedding, and caused a lot of heart ache. We got past the heart ache, but those two breaks still choke me sometimes. 

First, I picked the exact location of our harpist (a beautiful touch) for the reception, so everyone would hear her while canap√©s were served and mingling was happening. He had her moved on the day for no very good reason, and no one could hear her. 

Second, he locked horns on everything about the photographer, so that it is only today, three years later, that he has agreed to the layout and contents of the album. It was always inconvenient, or he wanted something else, or he would do something to a picture that I wouldn't have. Then I got pregnant and had neither the time or energy to chase him up rigorously. They closed the business last year, and until today, the due date of our baby, I thought I'd missed out completely. 
Learning to manage ADD and all the nuanced comorbidities has been a horrible adventure, but we are getting there, one hurdle at a time. 

NAW, but I can get this off my chest now, as the album arrives at the end of the month!
