LOUD background noises? I have read plenty hear and elsewhere about the wonders of noise cancelling headphones. I get how they work and think they are worth it. I do not have any currently.

I am currently *stuck* (long story, just go with it) working at this co-working space. Typical open office layout with all the usual frustrations. My problem is they regularly have events there, little seminars and workshops and stuff. So you'll get 15-30 people all talking, laughing, participating in loud games or whatever. Imagine you're at a restaurant and two tables over is a large group having a birthday party. That kind of noise. Better yet, they are doing long-term construction in the building - so there's drilling into concrete, etc. 

I have some very nice headphones that are over-ear style, but not noise cancelling. They are solid enough to block out typical coffee shop level noise. Not this. Plus they give a bit of that suction/swirling effect similar to ear plugs, so it leads to fatigue anyway.

In your experiences, any headphones that will work well for that loud of noise? If so, which models work for you. [Bose QC 25 ](Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones for Apple Devices, Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M1NEUKK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_0v7IybGM6VXNX) 
They are pricy, but so worth it in my opinion. I've had mine for 2 years and use them almost every day.
I travel for work, so a lot of working on planes/airport lounges. Crying babies? Drunk people? I don't hear them and it is heaven.  https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ELAM8LE/ Honestly? I bought some "noise isolating" ones from Walgreens, iHome, for $20. They are *amazing*. r/misophonia  not headphones, but the earplugs that got me through apartment renovations with drilling into concrete (at like 7am) while I had a 24/7 migraine with severe noise sensitivity: [Vater VSAS](https://www.vater.com/#!/product/287) Cool thanks. I always thought the noise cancelling tech didn't work for irregular/sporadic noises (e.g. the drunk guy who randomly shouts), but I'll look closer at them. I like Bose stuff. Just bought a car today with a Bose stereo and love it. Not sure how this helps, I guess I'm just saying the brand is good.  Yeah I've got some cheap Phillips headphones. I have to turn up the volume when it's really noisy like the OP describes, but I love my music so usually it's OK for a while. What they do not know (or do they..) is that 50% of the time I'm sitting there with my headphones on but no music lol.
 According to 23andme I have that... Life is hard.  You could always go somewhere like best buy where they have floor models and test out various models of noise cancelling headphones. Personally I found them really weird because I can still feel the noise against my ear even though sound is being canceled out, like a constant pressure. I mean, nothing can cancel out a really loud, sudden noise, but I honestly find them really good at eliminating the constant busy noise of a crowded place. It's constant, regardless of variances in louder speakers, proximity, etc
