Rant in response to researchers citing "teens who fake ADHD to get meds" as a reason to limit ADHD prescription drug (approx. 1800 words) **For the record, I'm one of the mods over at /r/neurodiversity, a subreddit about social issues that affect people with neurological disorders. I sometimes write rants/essays like this one as a way to get people thinking about said issues.**

A few days ago, this article headlined "Many Ivy League students don't view ADHD medication misuse as cheating" came up on my Twitter. And it bothered me.

http://www.psypost.org/2014/05/many-ivy-league-students-dont-view-adhd-medication-misuse-as-cheating-24883

I'm mainly responding to one paragraph from toward the end of this article, where the expert is talking about the practical implications of this survey finding. It says:

"The findings from this and similar studies pose a challenge to pediatricians, Dr. Adesman said. 'To the extent that **some high school and college students have reported feigning ADHD symptoms to obtain stimulant medication, should physicians become more cautious or conservative when newly diagnosing ADHD in teens?** Additionally, should pediatricians do more to educate their ADHD patients about the health consequences of misuse and the legal consequences that could arise if they sell or give away their stimulant medication?' "

As someone who wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until my late teens & early 20s, that line severely pissed me off.

I'm completely in favor of reminding students that have ADHD (or any other neurological variant) that they are still capable of getting a lot of important work done, even without meds, but here's the thing about avoiding giving new diagnoses to teens because they might be "faking" to get stimulants so they can "get ahead":

**Some of us actually don't need meds until we get into our teens.** I absolutely did not need meds to get my work done in K-12, and even though some of the other kids on the school newspaper figured out I had ADHD, it wasn't until I was taking a 20-credit college course load that anyone even thought about labeling my "inattention" and "impulsivity" as such...before that I was "obviously gifted but not applying herself", "intense in a spazzy way", "nerdy", "obsessed with school", "so much more trill than the other honors-track kids but still an honors-kid", and "flat-out bats**t crazy."

(Some of the kids who were on school newspaper staff with me figured it out, because they were with me for hours and hours each week, watching me pace in between finishing layout pages and observing that I was always either sitting on the floor, sitting on top of the tables and desks, or meandering around in front of the whiteboard...I was never, ever actually sitting at a desk like a normal person with the exception of a few occasions when our teacher/adviser was like, "SeaDragon! Stop pacing & sit down. I need to talk to you about this very specific, serious thing!"...I was the editor-in-chief, and journalism is kind of a weird, unstructured class anyway, so it wasn't a problem...But thinking back, I do think it's kind of funny that they tried to tell me, "SeaDragon, you act like you have ADHD", and I didn't believe them because my grades were too good... I wasn't looking for ADHD symptoms in myself.)

**I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20 and struggling to churn out the quantity of papers my six-class course load required of me.** I wasn't "faking" a goddamn thing. And the kicker is **I would never have taken myself in to see a shrink who could test me for ADHD, if it hadn't been for one night when I was so super-stressed out with two five-page papers, a chem exam, and a 25-screenplay due the next day, when I went to my ADD friend across the hall and asked if he could give one of his Adderalls, so I could pull an all-nighter and get all that done.**

I started reading one of the books I was writing my paper on, figuring I would just do my usual thing and "read the important parts" (In high school, I read maybe 5% of the books we were assigned all the way through, and for the rest, I would try to read as much as I could but almost always ended up having to just skip ahead to the most pivotal scenes toward the end of the book...because I needed to actually read those to make my papers and in-class essays work), but instead I ended up reading the whole final 2/3 of the book, about 200 pages in 3 hours.

Up until that night, I had no idea I could read that fast.

**I realized that I had a habit of unconsciously zoning out for a few seconds while I was reading and then coming back and then zoning out again, so for almost half the time when I'm reading, I'm not actually reading; I'm zoning.** I do it when I write, too. Zoning's not always a bad thing, because sometimes your brain needs a little bit to process an idea, but too much zoning will obviously slow you down when it comes to reading and writing stuff.

**I didn't even know I was doing it until I had "misused" my friend's ADD prescription and ended up "treating" an ADHD I didn't even know I had.**

You could hand-wring and say, "Oh, SeaDragon! That's terrible. Imagine if they had caught your ADHD earlier in school and you had actually been able to finish your English class readings and your geometry homework. You probably could have gone to an Ivy League school and you'd probably be a responsible person with a real job by now..."

But I wouldn't trade places with someone who was diagnosed and medicated for their ADHD in elementary school for the world.

**There are people who have benefited immensely from being diagnosed and/or medicated early in life, but I don't think I would have been one of them.** My meds tend to make me feel more tense/anxious than I would otherwise, and while that sometimes helps motivate me to get my work done, I wouldn't have wanted to grow up being medicated like that on a daily basis. 



**During those 20 years without meds, I learned how to use my impulsivity and distractability to my own advantage.** I don't beat myself up for being inattentive; I do what my impulses lead do and then organize and share the products of my inattention with other people. (*Hello, Reddit!*)

...In other words, my ADHD is a big part of what makes me me. It holds me back in a lot of situations but it gives me what a lot of people see as a "creative edge."

(I don't see myself as creative at all; I see myself as someone who thinks about lots of really weird things and asks tons of questions all the time and who is lucky/privileged/educated enough to be able to put those weird thoughts into forms that sort-of make sense to other people...)

**I know that lots of people really do need their meds (even from an early age) in order to function, and most people with unmedicated ADHD probably wouldn't have done as well as I did in school/college before I was diagnosed.**

**...But I don't think that means that I'm "faking" or "hypochondiac-ing" my neurological difference. I also don't think I'm "cheating" when I take my meds.** I'm taking a mind-altering substance in order to help myself navigate a cultureal & physical infrastructure that isn't well set up for minds like mine. I just didn't feel stressed out about my neurological difference to want to take meds on a daily basis until after college.

If you're sitting there thinking, **"Well if you can get through high school without meds, you can probably hold down a job without them, so you don't actually need them,"** to that I say, "BITCH, YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE!"

**I know I am capable of holding down "a job" without meds, but I would be miserable if I were stuck in a job where I couldn't use my inattentiveness to write about weird things (I'm a science writer) & build discussion forums where other people can communicate about their weird things, too.** 

That requires long hours of sitting in front of a computer. Meds make that a lot easier. **I'd rather be medicated and be happier/more productive than not take meds and be miserable/always feeling like I failed to do thing I was meant to do.**

And I know that I'm whining from a place of privilege/advantage, but **it really freaks me out when teachers and shrinks and parents adopt an attitude of "This kid with ADHD or ASD or bipolar is making C's in school (even though he obviously has moments of brilliance that could be channeled more productively, if somebody built an appropriate platform for sharing that stuff.) But we don't have time to build those platforms, and he's passing his classes, so he's fine!** We've succeeded. He doesn't needs meds!"

I'm really lucky that platform-building (e.g. founding school science magazines, bulding my own blog, deciding that I'm going to start writing massively long status updates b/c why the hell not?) is one of the main things that my impulsivity drives me toward, because **most neurodivergent kids either have trouble imagining what a platform for their natural communication would look like or have internalized the idea that "It's too hard. I can't do it."**

**I'm sure that there are lots of kids who do "fake" ADHD to "get ahead"**, and I know that there are lots of kids who sell their prescribed medicine, but **I think it's unfair to restrict access to medication for the people who happen to be lucky/unlucky enough that they don't need meds (or realize that they need meds) until their teens.**

**Maybe, instead, we should be talking about the fact that our school infrastructure is so centered around keeping your butt planted in a chair writing papers all night that "normal" kids at Ivy League schools think that taking stimulants you don't need is acceptable.**

Why is "getting ahead" completely centered around the exact tasks that are hardest for ADHD and ASD kids to do without help?

**tl;dr:** Saying we should restrict/limit prescriptions for people who don't need ADHD meds until their teens b/c "teens might fake ADHD to cheat in school" is stupid, b/c lots of people legitimately don't need meds to function until high school or college. Man stay off PsyPost, I just end up yelling at my screen when I go on there. Besides the survey is crap. Of the 616 non-ADHD Ivy League students, 18% self reported stimulant use = 110 subjects. That's no surprise, why not get some other drug use rates, and then compare them to medicated ADHD cohorts? Oh because it would show lower rates of substance abuse, and that would detract from the overall political message, and also highlight why Pediatricians are shitty researchers.

 Additionally, did you find it ironic that the group prescribing ADHD medication is implying that they are not at fault for prescribing the medication to individuals without ADHD?

Pediatricians make shitty researchers, and screw shit up a lot but because they are MD's no one outside of the research community really calls them on it.

 Eg- Spongebob causes ADHD... Seriously that was the conclusion of a study done by pediatricians. 

 I'm so afraid of seeming like a drug seeker everytime I go for a med checkup. I go to therapy also(to manage depression and ADHD), and my therapist talks to my doctor and is fully aware that I actually dislike taking anything not necessary and I don't do *any* recreational drugs.

I feel like there's such a strong bias that ADHD has to be present at a young age and people who struggle later in life are just faking it for meds. I regularly placed 98/99th percentile on standardized tests as a child among other things. I'm a highschool dropout and if I mention it I get looked at like I'm an idiot. I'm also successfully completing a dual STEM(CS/math) program at a good university thanks to treating my disorders. If I never received treatment I'd probably still be sitting in my parents house playing video games and doing nothing productive.

I never struggled as a kid because I felt like everything just came easy to me. As soon as I had to start applying myself I felt like everything around me just fell apart, I couldn't get more than few pages into a textbook without just drifting off and daydreaming without even realizing it. Aye! This may be entirely wrong but in the US with it's privatised healthcare wouldn't there be monetary incentive to give out prescriptions? If that's true I imagine doctors would be more inclined to hand them out to anyone willing to pretend they have it (not all doctors of course, I'm sure most of them keep their integrity).

But no, they shouldn't restrict access to teenagers, that does more harm than good. If these alleged cheaters do exist I would rather have them slander the already shaky opinion of ADHD than potentially ruining the lives of people who have it. > ...But I don't think that means that I'm "faking" or "hypochondiac-ing" my neurological difference. I also don't think I'm "cheating" when I take my meds. I'm taking a mind-altering substance in order to help myself navigate a cultureal & physical infrastructure that isn't well set up for minds like mine. I just didn't feel stressed out about my neurological difference to want to take meds on a daily basis until after college.

THIIIIIS

THIIIIIIS THIS THIS THIS

yes.
I did end up being diagnosed and treated in high school, junior year. But I was in a very high pressure environment.  Regardless. All of your points are really on point. Media has been horrible about their portrayal of a person with ADHD, I don't understand their motivations at all, for most of what they release literally helps NO ONE. I suppose it instills fear in some parents. The concept of "cheating on tests with stimulants" is stupidly repulsive. It implies university is some kind of competition between your peers.

You don't need to study, 'cause you took some adderall and it'll whisper to you all the answers!
