First time discovering this subreddit Its overwhelming to me, going from not even knowing anyone with adhd, to finding this, i have alot of questions, and im sorry if its alot, but theres things thst ive learned recently that i feel i need to share/ ask about, 

The medications i have been given have had horrible effects, zero appetite, very low energy, to the point where someone would talk to me, and all i would do is think my response, not even saying it, inability to sleep, depression, stemming from the lack of energy,

Feeling absolutely horrible when i wake up, to the point where im not coherent/have no memory of the times im woken up before finally waking up to the point of actual conciousness,

On that same point, an odd effect on my energy level, having basically zero energy after waking, no matter how much sleep ive gotten, progessively increasing to being fully alert and basically wired, at around 1 to 2 am, where going to sleep is difficult

(Note: all these things observed long after stopping treatment) 

General lack of motivation

Lack of emotion, everything just seems to not effect me, the only defined emotions o feel are anger, sadness, and jealousy, all other emotions just seem to mirror others emotions at the time, without any real feeling to them

Being extremely introverted, having only one real friend and my long-time girlfriend/fiance thst i really feel connected with, conversing and interactiong with other people just seems like a chore that has to be dealt with throughout the day

I know this is alot of things at once, and being new to this subreddit/ community i hope i havent made any mistakes with my post here, im not suprised that it might seem all over the place, ive had to restart this three times now from getting distracted and having the page refresh and losing all my progress, any replies are appreciated

Edit: sorry about the terrible layout and spelling errors, currently at work as a chef and had to jump up a coulpe times to cook orders

Edit 2: some key info, i have been diagnosed with severe ADD and ADHD since the age of 7
