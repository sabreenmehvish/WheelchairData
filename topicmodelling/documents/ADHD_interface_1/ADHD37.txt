Okay, lights off, 11pm time for bed.. As soon as my head hits the pillow my brain is like *'oh, you meant to Google this ! Look that might be interesting to search! Urgh, this rooms layout is boring, let's change things up a bit!'*

And so that carries on for 2 hours if not more every day. How do I make this little W Anker cooperate and sleep? Sleeping pills when it's critical masturbating when it's not  This has been a struggle my entire life -- even when I was a kid! I haven't completely won yet, but a few things increase my odds of a good night sleep: 

* a routine (super boring,  I know, and hard to keep up with for me, but scientifically proven to work... if you can manage it...). An hour or half hour of relaxing activities that you do in a set order every night leading up to bed. This can include hygiene like brushing your teeth, but should not include screentime because it's so easy to fall down a distraction rabbit hole and lose track of time, plus blue light is proven to trigger awakeness. Some activities I've had some success with as part of my routine (since I have trouble maintaining a routine, it often changes) include: 

--- yoga, relaxing bedtime yoga helps relax body and mind

--- reading (this is great, but it can backfire when I get sucked in and stay up all night)
--- practicing a musical instrument 

--- journaling 

--- showering 


* exercise/sunshine during the day

* avoiding food too late at night. This is hard because I can't sleep if I'm hungry, but on the other hand, if I eat, I'm generally going to be up for a while afterwards -- food is energy! I suppose the cure is to either go to bed earlier or, since I know I'll be hungry between dinner and bed, snack early instead of waiting til I'm hungry. Haven't found a perfect cure for this, just know I do stay up if I eat.

* yoga. I know I said yoga in the bedtime routine, but learning yoga (in general, not just doing it at night) has helped me combat sleep difficulties because it made me aware of my body. I have always been a daydreamer and was hardly aware of my body at all.  I'd get lost in my thoughts or in a task and not even realize I was hungry or sleepy ... This still happens, but I'm getting better. Anyway, yoga taught me how to pay attention to my body (when I remember to,  haha). This skill is very useful when I'm trying to sleep because my thoughts are what keep me up (most of the time), so if I can manage to focus on my breath or the weight of my body sinking into the bed, I'm much more likely to fall asleep. 

Like I said none of these are ADD proof, but even a small step in these directions can have a big impact.  "Huh, it's 10:30, I should start getting ready for bed. I'll get get to a stopping point in my book..."

"Ok, I finished that chapter.  It's 11:00.  I should probably get ready for bed."

"Okay, I'm done with that section of my project and it's midnight. I need to get up early for work, I should get to bed."

"That was a really interesting article, but it's 12:30 and I NEED to be in bed now."

"WTF how is it 1:30AM already?"

Every night. :/ Yup, i am like that also and i even try to sleep with the tv on so that i have something to listen so that my mind doesnt come up with things like that. Also i been using this eye mask for sleeping and it has helped a lot. SleepTown app I used to do a quick 10 minutes of yoga before bed but stopped at some point in college. I suggest that, or working out during the day (even if it's just half an hour of running on a treadmill) since it'll make you more tired by the time you're in bed) We have started using the Calm app every night.  I like the meditations,  but mostly we just use it for the sleep stories. We tried it out for a couple weeks and loved it so much we pay the $60 annual subscription.  Yeah, I'm with you on that one; I find going to bed hard bc i'm super tired but i don't want to sleep because I need stimulation, but not too much stimulation or else I can't sleep. What I've found is that if I focus on counting each intake of breath to around 20-30 and then starting from one again is that it gives me something to focus on that allows me to drop off. If i start thinking about stuff i go, 'oh right, i'm supposed to be counting' and start from the last number i was on. Putting on an ambient noise app also works. Mine's set to turn off after twenty minutes of thunderstormy-rain and ocean noises. It took a little bit to figure out, but it's helpful for me. 1. I use a bullet journal and every night before bed I review what I did and jot down notes on my day- mood, pills, good moments, etc. I also keep a scratch pad with it to capture random thoughts, to-do, etc. thinking about googling that one thing? Write it down instead. It will help you remember to do it the next day. Or you’ll read it and think-“that is silly and not with my time” 

2. I start turning down lights about 60-90 minutes before bed and I use f.lux on my computer to gradually dim the blue light and the nighttime function on my cell. I’m working on not using screens before bed but I’m a working student and I’m usually doing classwork online in the evenings. 

3. If I’m in bed and can’t sleep, my therapist recommended deep diaphragmatic breathing- slow deep breaths in and out. Engage the diaphragm by making sure your breaths fill up your belly. This usually helps. Just focus on the breath. 

4. If that doesn’t work, I’ll pull out something boring to read- keep an old textbook or something you don’t like reading by your bed.  I just watch TV until I'm tired Have a wank too early and you doom yourself Any resources for a beginner to the yoga thing?  I've been interested for a variety of reasons but haven't had the chance to learn much, and always felt that the tutorials I've seen have moved really fast without explaining the poses well. :/ true... i actually expected this comment to be downvoted or mod removed lol  Have you tried Yoga with Adriene on YouTube? She has tons of videos and is one of the best on YouTube at explaining things, in my opinion. It definitely helps to search for beginner yoga when you're starting out because otherwise people tend to assume you know how the pose is supposed to be held. I've also found that if I watch a video that assumes I know a pose that I don't, I can search that pose individually and there are tons of short videos for each pose that explain them (but to varying degrees...).

I wish I could help more! I started with a very slow vhs tape that the library was giving away when they phased vhs out. It was fantastic because it spent a long time on each pose and talked a lot about breath, but I can't remember the name and I don't know if it's available anywhere online. 

One thing I will say is to focus on tutorials that emphasize poses, not "vinyasas" because those can move quickly. "Beginner yoga poses slow " might be a good search? I hope that helps! Seriously, thanks for all the info.  Half of the reason I have never gotten into it is not knowing where to start.  Going to give that a good look over tonight. You're welcome.  I really hope it helps because I know the barrier to starting can be difficult, but the payoff in the end is so worth it. 

I can give you a couple of tips that helped me that are so basic people sometimes don't mention them in tutorials 

* unless stated, yoga poses are often intended to be held with "active" muscles. Active means engaged rather than relaxed,  but most teachers assume you know that and don't explain. So for instance in basic "mountain pose" (basically looks like you're just standing), you are focusing on keeping your whole body "active" from your toes to your head, imagining you are a tree growing roots into the ground and your spine is stretching to the sky. From the outside it might not look like you're doing much, but inside you're engaging and stretching almost your whole body! 

* breath is super important in yoga, but again not everyone explains it because they assume you know. The general rule is that you breath out while exerting effort (like pushing up from plank to downward dog) or when relaxing/contracting into a position (the arched position in cat cow), and you breath in while expanding and creating more space (the belly out position in cat cow or when you reach for the sky at the beginning of a yoga routine or once you have moved into downward dog and are focused on stretching). When you hold a pose for a long time, you work through several breaths, using breath to find new space in your body as you gently stretch and to relax into that new space as you breath out. 

Those two tips should help with nearly any video, I hope. And also, like I said, I like Yoga with Adriene a lot. I'm sure she had some beginner videos that are great (I hope so) because she does a good job of explaining even in her normal videos. But I definitely recommend a slow paced video, even one that says stretching or something rather than exercise. That can help you gain confidence in the poses and your practice and also learn the mindset (which, as a daydreamer, really changed my connection to my body!).  Okay, your question sparked my interest, so for yoga today, I looked up Yoga With Adriene for Beginners and found this video and worked through it 

https://youtu.be/pWobp3phsEU

It was great.  I definitely recommend it as a place to start. Looks like she also has some shorter beginner videos, but I would really encourage you to give this one a go and not be afraid to come back to it if you need to until you feel comfortable.  It looks like she also has a "Yoga Foundations" series where she goes into detail about individual poses, if you need more. I'd specifically encourage you to look into "Corpse Pose" (the meditative pose at the end of every yoga video that just looks like you're lying on the ground) because it is very useful for learning to focus your thoughts away from the 80,000 trails they like to take and move them to your body. Learning this is what has helped me more than anything to sleep at night. Here are a couple of corpse pose videos: 


https://youtu.be/eSeRjoolN2A (Adriene)

https://youtu.be/Mc-38vuwE1Y (a more traditional and guided meditation into corpse pose. Maybe a bit on the cheesy side, but I found this kind of detailed guided relaxation really helpful because it was so unnatural to me. Even now, I often find myself walking through the steps because it's hard for me to just "let go" instantaneously)

Yoga is a whole new way of thinking and awareness,  so don't feel bad or give up just because it doesn't click right away. Don't worry if your body shakes or your mind drifts. Just be kind to yourself and commit to coming back and trying again and again as necessary. Even seasoned yogis find those things happening! Yoga isn't about perfection (any teacher who says so isn't worth listening to!); it's about learning to connect to your body and creating awareness and grace for yourself. It's about the journey and knowing every day is different.  Okay, so I still haven't looked into it and worked on this yet.  :/  Guess that's why I frequent this subreddit.

I know you have no stake in this, really, I'm just posting to try and keep myself accountable.  I plan on looking into this and starting tonight/this weekend. :D I've been thinking about you, actually and wondering how or if it worked out. Thanks for the update. Good luck !
