[funny] I am an accomplished, frustrated, exhausted idiot. Silly little story about me and my ADHD and today that I thought some might find amusing or relate to.   

**(yesterday, 1 p.m.):**  look at calendar for Wednesday. Think to self: wow, tomorrow is a packed day! Kids have soccer, golf, choir, then therapy after school. Crap. Then, Thursday, one kid has an early morning doctor appointment and another has one right after school. Okay, better see what I can do in advance.  

**(yesterday 1:30 pm)** crap! Where the hell is the other shin guard?! Okay, better find and wash all the soccer stuff. Run to store to get another set of shin guards. Frantically make a schedule and an extensive to do list for Wednesday during the day to make that afternoon and Thursday easier. Going to have to make time to shower and do my hair (it is long and there is no way I am going to get up early enough to do it Thursday morning). Okay. I got this. I know exactly what to do when. We will have fast food Wednesday night for dinner and we will do homework while we wait for therapy to be done. Great! I am ON TOP of this shit!!

**(today, 11 am):** do all regular chores I can possibly do for today now. Gather up golf clubs from their various landing places, put them in bag, put bag in front hall. Gather all soccer stuff, including new shin guards and assemble in a bag. Find water bottle, wash, fill, add to bag. Add some soda (caffeine helps kid when meds wear off... At exactly the time practice starts). Put bag on front doorknob so I don't forget it. Take shower. Spend eternity doing hair. Call pediatrician to remind them to pull other kid's chart. Aha!!!! Remember that I have to call drug store to have them fill other kid's 'scrip! Go me!!! NOTHING is getting past me today! I even have time to play trains with the little guy. YES!!

**(Today, 3 pm)** get the boy and bring him home to get him ready for golf, and then immediately leave to get teenage daughter from chor. And then....

..... Husband calls cell to tell me golf is cancelled. phone had been unplugged all day. Hadn't noticed. Didn't get call. They called him, irate. It is rescheduled for tomorrow and Friday.  
.... find the shin guard I tore the house apart looking for on the front seat of the car.  
.....pharmacy tells me that I had already called to refill the prescription and that it is in fact waiting for me to pick it up.  
.... Daughter reminds me that they have no more choir rehearsal this year as they already had their concert and she will be home on the bus ("duh, mom.").  
... Husband tells me that he had there is no soccer practice today and that it is in fact tomorrow and didn't I read the email he forwarded me? (yeah, but I didn't catch the Thursday part).  
... I have no need to get fast food for dinner since I will be home, but haven't prepped or defrosted anything and haven't even thought about it. Fuck.  

**(Today, 5 pm)** step over huge train layout on living room floor. Boil pasta with butter for kids. Look at insane new schedule for tomorrow. Hyperventilate. Open jar of Nutella. Lay down on bed. Start Civ5 on computer. Nearly forget about therapy completely.  

FUCK THIS SHIT. At least my hair looks awesome.  

**TL;DR:  went crazy trying to prep for a busy day. Was super proud of myself. Didn't notice that it all was becoming irrelevant and pushed to another day. Got frustrated. Ate Nutella. Played video games.** [deleted] I am no joke just about to start Civ 5 on my computer. I haven't earned it though. I feel guilty. 

You, however, have definitely earned it. Seriously, you're a badass mum!  Thanks. I was actually surprisingly calm. It made me laugh more than anything. I mean, who is really going to complain when their day winds up giving them LESS work (on that day, anyway)?

As my husband pointed out, I was at that point (temporarily) ahead. 
LOL Heh, thanks. Now if only I can get through today.

Civ is like my one ADHD pro tip. One turn, one super-small job. One turn, one super small job.....  If only life were like Civ 5: one turn, one small job, one turn, one small job. 

We'd be so boss at life.
