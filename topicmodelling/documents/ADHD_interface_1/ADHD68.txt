I wonder, how do you guys deal with self-improving demands and responsibilities in college made by you, without swamping yourself and severely hurting your academics? Alright, I'll be yet another early 20-something asking for help, probably asking the same question someone else has asked, and that someone else has answered thoroughly and will probably copy-paste from his old answer because, let's admit it, a 450 word reddit comment detailing your personal tribulations and successes shouldn't be held back by repetitive key-stroking (and good thing modern technology exists, so that you can connect with others that need help and give them a warm, empathetic hand). But I'm definitely curious.

How have you guys dealt with more responsibility in college? Not just academic, but personal, self-developing responsibilities?

**For those short on time: Hi, this is end-of-story me, I wrote down a giant wall of text that I'm confident you won't have the mental fortitude to finish in one sitting and without skimming after the first sentence-and-a-half of each paragraph. So I added a TL;DR at the bottom of the page, which is just the above question but more fleshed out. Sorry I didn't move it up here**

For context: I've done terribly when adding/removing things on my to-do list. This semester, I've taken the minimum credit hours possible, with the easiest classes available, hoping to focus on studying, seeking help, and developing myself (and my portfolio); but instead I've ended feeling completely overwhelmed at my current responsibilities. Which are, as of right now, only my classes.

I've used Toggl to track my time usage, made an excel spreadsheet to track finances, used Google Calendar to block out working times throughout the day AND label deadlines in a single document, bought a Mi Band to use as a kinetic alarm clock to wake up, and used a journal to break down large assignments into smaller, manageable sections that I cross out with a red marker (**and only** with a red marker).

Yet, I still felt completely overwhelmed. I'm doing average at best on the class I'm repeating from last semester, my other classes have above-average grades at best, but I've failed to maintain myself in the groups I want to stick around with because I constantly feel absolutely overwhelmed, and have a deathly feeling of *having* to be fully involved with my academics instead of something else. It's like I'm on-call 24/7.

I got medicated the past month, and I'm seeing the only therapist I can really afford around town. Methylphenidate has done wonders to keep my mind silenced enough to understand my emotions and be physically *able* to meditate, but it's too little too late to salvage this semester. And you know what? Fine by me, just being able to feel this...silence, has been jaw-dropping to say the least. I can feel my emotions more vividly, be more honest with my thoughts, and at the same time be more conscious about *how* to interface with my emotions. For the first time, I was able to sit through a 26 minute guided meditation video, and its teachings have literally ingrained myself in me; I can view myself as a screen where vivid images and emotions are projected now, and I can realistically observe and comment on them. Right now, I had a random song pop into my head; my inner monologue said "oh, shush", and I could fully suppress that song and return to the present. I have tried this for **years**, and it's never worked; I'm amazed I'm casually shushing my brain to return to the present now, it's wonderful! It was definitely worth throwing this semester under the bus, even though it adds to my student debt regardless; I can be going out of it with sub-par grades and few accomplishments, but...the meds, sometimes the immediacy of my existence with my meds makes me want to cry, it's beautiful.

However, I wouldn't be asking this question if this was just a single semester's worth of trouble. This has happened for the past 3 years, and I'll likely be getting my bachelor's after 5 1/2 years of study. I'm happy I'll get it, even after going through some absolutely stressful events during my first two years, even if it takes me more time than others (but then again, I'll also have a minor), but I'm more worried about that *overwhelm* I constantly feel repeatedly surfacing. That overwhelm I feel *all the time throughout uni*, that same overwhelm I can't stop from overtaking my interests and sucking my time away into academics. I can't even acknowledge calendars and time management, I ignore every alarm and side-step every time-based blocking application I've used *just* to continue working on whatever I'm presently working in. The pomodoro, that often-lauded system? I tried it, as an assistant to my planned schedule. I've failed to stop for the 25 minute mark, and instead run off to hours-long working binges I absolutely enjoy, followed by proportionally-long breaks. I've tried for weeks, and I always fail to get a benefit from the pomodoro if I don't use a 90 minute interval, followed by....highly variable break periods. Still, it's kept me relatively productive, but for the first several weeks I tried it, every grade I've had just...tanked.

I stopped caring about my grades, and just focused on learning. I'm deeply jealous of others that can have 3 presidential roles and take 19 credit hours, the people I came in during my class of 2018 and are now taking their senior design courses, the same people I see networking and befriending a solid connection of references, coworkers, managers, and professors, but I'm not trying to be them; I'm trying to improve myself. But somehow, I constantly disappoint myself. It's not that I have a GPA floating around 2.5, I've come to terms with the handicap that number is going to give me; it's seeing others maintain a 2.5 while exerting themselves to their full potential, and having me imitate that same exertion and realizing that, in a way, I already *am*. I look up to the work ethic of others, and envy their ability to grasp academics quickly enough to keep pace with a class; but when I try to emulate that same work ethic and use it as an inspiration, I constantly feel over-stretched and incapable, and likewise that incapability is reflected in my work.

If it was just a feeling, I would've used the AWARE model to perceive, observe, and comment on the feeling as a third party. But it's not just a feeling, it's the actual reality. I work my hardest to improve myself, to learn skills I want to learn, but...I constantly drop my efforts and teachings and skills because I realize my classes are suffering, and I return to keeping my GPA floating at a *barely* justifiable level. I started a UI-a-Day course this semester, it went well for about three weeks, then I realized I wasn't keeping pace with my classes; I was falling behind on the material. So, triage, I spent less time on the UI-a-Day to salvage my classes, then even less time, then even less...eventually, I dropped it in favor of keeping up with classes. It's frustrating to see yourself so far behind what you personally want to achieve, what you thoroughly and excruciatingly planned for, and tempered yourself with mental fortitude by internalizing that "plans are useless, but planning is indispensable". That motto's proven true, and it's actually helped me become more adaptable to changing circumstances. But it still frustrates me that, when working my best, stressing myself and pushing myself to my academic limit, I could only achieve what others would consider an everyday task.

I just...can't understand anymore. How do other people develop their skills and improve themselves in college, build a social network of like-minded individuals, and still stay above a 2.0? I've pushed myself to the limit, but even then I can barely achieve a goal I feel proud of. Every little victory counts, right? But what if that victory is washing the dishes, while you know you could wash the dishes AND do the clothes? Every little victory is a step forward that I recognize, but it's disappointing to see my victories be trivial in my world.

I feel like I'm losing my locus of control. My entire childhood was dominated by my family pushing me to do my best, and keeping me inside the house because the outside was too dangerous. I can't blame them, but it certainly didn't help me understand myself as an agent individual. When I reached college, the initial stress and dependence on others made my personal agency fall even farther from myself, but I managed to pull it towards myself and gain a sense of personal control; theoretically, an inward locus of control. But after this semester, I've slowly felt that locus return outwards. I've lost my sense of self control and ability to change myself. Is that true? No, and I constantly observe this feeling pop up during stressful times, all the while cataloging it on my recently-formalized journal. But I can't close my eyes to tangible and action-based evidence: somehow, I set myself goals and push myself forward, and yet I still feel without agency. I don't mind being dependent on a pill, but what I *do* mind is being unable to improve myself regardless, even when pushing myself to my mental limit. I observe these feelings and see them being not true, I've improved over the course of time; but I simply can't argue that my progress has been...mediocre, at best. My best efforts haven't changed who I am, and this is being proven by my actions as a free, independent human; how can I keep my locus of control, my positivity and optimism in change, when there's repeated, tangible, empirical evidence that demonstrates whatever change I've faced has been, at best, diminutive? I'm desperately holding on to the positive, but it's hard to treasure my positives when I'm surrounded by tangible disappointment. Not failure, disappointment. Yet somehow, I literally cannot tolerate anything else.

**Uh...wow this is a giant wall, isn't it? Alright, I'll leave a note at the top sending you over here.**

**TL;DR, how do you guys handle greater amounts of self-improving responsibility and pressure, without feeling overwhelmed and failing your academic responsibilities? How can you push yourself to improve your network, abilities, leadership, or knowledge, without getting kicked out of school?**

And uh, sorry for the wall again. I s'pose it's the methylphenidate working.
 How was school before college, say high school and middle school? 

I wish I can say I agree with your post. But my brain has too much fog to understand what I really think and say. Let's just say one of my emotions agree. I swamped myself to the point where I didn't have the chance to feel overwhelmed? I was working 20 hours/week in a research lab, taking 17 credits, and founding a club to help other people with networking and finding research opportunities.  In order for me to motivate myself, I *have* to enjoy it; it has to matter to *me*. At work, my employer works very hard to help his business and employees. I do my best to help him dampen that burden, because he treats me like a person, not a number. Otherwise, I will procrastinate the living hell out of it until the last minute to where it is considered *urgent*. It can me emotionally or physically important, it can be challenging, or something new and interesting, but it has to matter.  I don't.  I'm here at exam week silently afraid that I'm going insane, and it's almost like I lost all motivation to do anything.  I was the same way as you this semester.  Time just flew by - I had good intentions going in but how I'm yet again on the verge of a breakdown if I don't perform this next week.   Yeah I just don't...

I used to in high school but it got really bad and I started struggling with mental health so I pulled back in college. 

I'm basically the flakey friend that will prioritize school over other things. I don't have many friends and I'm not involved anything but my grades are good! And I'm mostly happy with my situation. It's what I needed to do for me to survive college with sanity intact. I understand it's not a possible option for everyone it's just how I've had to do it.  Stayed indoors most weeks, only went out to my friends' place with my mom driving me, and I *rarely, if ever*, stepped outside of my house and to my locality, if it didn't involve stepping outside to go to the bus.

I literally did nothing outside of home. But that also meant I could do a lot of other homework I didn't do in class. Math? Hah, I had no math homework for my last 2 years specifically because I did it in class.

Grades were fair, I got a 91 graduating. Lots of As and Bs, some Cs with the big exams, and incredibly high grades for papers/research projects I *actually* kept up with.

Extracurriculars-wise, there was model UN, band, and uh, track I s'spose? But track was literally because some other friend cajoled me into it; yeah, no, I never got good at it. I...actually never got good at anything else, either. My best accomplishment could be band, but I still paled in comparison to other french horn players.

Although the kinetic nature of the horn made it easy to remember. Shieeeet, I still remember the full scale for the horn AND somewhat for the trumpet to this day.

If only instruments weren't so damn expensive in every shape and form. Or noisy. But what purpose was it in swamping yourself? What drives you in juggling all those things?  We are in the same boat. The fact that I'm passionate about what I do I guess. I had calculated that in order to finish my degree in 4 years, I basically needed to take 17 credits every semester. I also had scholarships that would only work for 4 years so, financially I would be unable to afford to finish if I took any longer. I loved my major though so that's ok.

I loved my research job. In no way was I ever obligated to work a certain amount of hours. I just LOVED working that much. 

I also love helping others and I'm really good at networking. Tbh one of the things I do when I'm drunk is help people find research positions.  I have to Ace an exam to get a C.  I have a week to do it but bloody hell I could have just literally copied and pasted solutions from Google into my online assignments consistently for maybe 10 minutes every week and I wouldn't have this problem.  I fucking rage so hard at how easy it is to miss out on stuff like that.
