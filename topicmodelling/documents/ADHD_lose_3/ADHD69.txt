Found my glasses after two weeks of looking! They were properly put away in my glasses drawer in their case. Sometimes I lose things when they're put away in their proper place. Does this happen to anyone else? When I'm driving, I'll do the pocket check (which is pretty much involuntary at this point), and I'll freak out because my keys aren't there. 

*Because I'm fucking driving.* Oh boy.  Guilty.

I actually get mad at my Husband when he puts things where they belong - because I can't find them. 

And what's so stupid is that I never ever look in the one place where its *logical* for that object to be.  I know just as well as him where things should go.  

I look high and low for something in all the spots I'm hell for dumping stuff at, and after searching and tearing through the house....  I'll start getting a fit of anxiety and panic thinking that I must have dropped it in a parking lot, left it on a shelf in a grocery store, etc.  

My Husband will ask what I'm looking for and he'll say: "oh, I put it away/put it back in its spot."

And then I'm mad because I'm damn near in tears thinking that in my ADHDness that I lost it somewhere and its gone forever - like my purse, my phone, or my debit card/wallet. 

"Damn it, Honey! You know I can't find *shit* when it goes where its suppose to!! You have to TELLMETHESETHINGSOMGSOBSOBSOB."

My poor, wonderful Husband. :) I spent an hour looking for the remote control, gave up and went to refill my drink. Opened the freezer to get ice and...you guessed it, there was the remote. Yes! Don't you just hate it when things are where they are supposed to be? It confuses me all the time! I avoid closed storage spaces. Everything I have is as visible as possible. hahaha i fucking hate this. i look everywhere, EVERYWHERE until I find it in a perfectly normal place and realize I was trying to be 'good' in that past moment. 

no more! eyeglasses stay in the undershirt drawer from now on, because my weirdo subconscious thinks that makes more sense. Thanks for the chuckle. Happens all the time. :D All.The.Time. But I don't beat myself up over it anymore. I try to consider it part of my quirky style. Being kind to myself has been one of the greatest lessons I've learned in the past few years.  I am a teacher, and I try very hard to keep organized.  At the start of this year, I had a bunch of very important forms that I needed to have signed and dated by some parents.  I knew I couldn't afford to lose them.  I had all but one of them signed, so I put them away in a safe spot.

A couple months later, I needed them. I could not find them anywhere! I looked every possible place.  I was looking for them for two weeks! I even had another teacher come in my room and we turned every drawer inside out, every pile was sorted, every shelf was looked though, but we couldn't find them.  I knew that I had put them someplace safe.  I had put them where I couldn't possibly lose them.

Then, I went and rechecked my student data folders (which are right on a counter because I drop important papers in them on a daily basis).  This time, I decided to check them all.  I had only checked the first one on the stand before.  Sure enough, there they were.  They were exactly where they should be.

It turned out that the first folder on the stand happened to belong to the one student I wasn't able to get the form from.  So, that one folder didn't have it in it.  The rest of the folders had the paper right in the front, where I had safely stapled it to the folder so it wouldn't get lost.

Like you, this wasn't a one time event. It seems that organization often makes my life harder because I **expect** things to not be where they belong. Happens with my keys all the time.  Yep :) Constantly.  Where something belongs is the last place I expect it to be. yes.... I work in a kitchen. Literally every time I can't find something it's right in front of me. At least you didn't forget brand new glasses in a bathroom in the mall then forget about them for three weeks, which then the mall gets rid of them. :(   I don't de-clutter, because I have a near-photographic memory, but really shitty working memory. In practice, this means I won't remember where I put something if I make a regular effort to keep the place is clean and orderly, but I will be able to remember when I set last set something down and use that to excavate different layers of sediment to find whatever I'm looking for. I hope there is an ADD afterlife where you get all the time spent looking for keys and glasses back to do something fun. I always keep my previous model glasses in my car just in case I can't find them at home. Got my housemate to ring my phone because I'd lost it an hour ago, right next to where I'm sitting. Yes. The one time that I put my keys in the designated key pocket in my bag, I thought I lost them, turned the rest of the bag inside out, and then ran a mile to the bus stop where I thought I must have left them. And then I found them in the pocket. The *worst* is when I spend a day organizing and stuff has a new place - and I can't find any of it the next day.

I finally created rules for myself: wallet, keys, and watch are deposited in a bin next to the door *as soon as* I walk in the door; hairbrush only goes from the medicine cabinet to my head and back (no more walking around with it and putting it down... somewhere?); glasses are either on my head, in the medicine cabinet if I'm wearing contacts or showering, or on my bedside stand. It's really reduced my stress and self-blame, which makes it totally worth it (and it's become second nature!).

My phone is much harder to have a "rule" about where it lives. Thank goodness for "Find my iPhone": I'm not sure that I **ever** would have found it under the Christmas decorations in the middle of August when I didn't remember having touched those boxes (and it was on silent, of course). You get so used to them not being in the proper place that it never crosses the mind to look in said proper place.  Yes, that happens all the time. I do this with my phone almost daily. After losing so many phones I've trained myself to always keep it in my hand or pocket, and without fail, at least once a day when I'm talking on the phone I will flip the fuck out because I can't find it. I was so relieved to know that this is normal amoung ADD and ADHD people and not, in fact, me being stupid.  Losing stuff is the number one thing that makes me hate myself.  It's the worst thing about having ADHD and none of the strategies I've tried seems to make a single bit of difference. Upvoted this yesterday without even reading or opening it. Why? Because it's the story of my life in two short sentences. This drives me absolutely insane. I'm a college student and I constantly lose my keys. The last time that happened, they were "lost" in my catchall desk drawer... which I checked probably six times. Facepalm worthy is when you completely forget for a few seconds and panic, but it's in your hand...

Like I preemptively take out my keys and when I get to the door I got distracted and then think, oh shit where are my keys? Proceed to rambling about and tapping my pockets with key in hand. I've managed to lose my glasses while they are on my face. And my keys while I'm driving. My phone in my back pocket while it's going off (I literally was spinning in circles trying to figure out where it was.) So many other things...  That happens _on my motorcycle._ I'll start looking for my cell phone when I'm talking on it. My girlfriend has heard me say "I'm almost ready to go, I just need to find my phone" while talking to her on the phone more times than I care to admit. HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH! Can relate so hard My wife does this to me ALL THE TIME.

"I can't find my laptop!"

â€œI put it away"

"Do you know where my running shoes are?"

"I put them with the shoes" this may sound odd but having ADD, i really hope i find a girl that's similarly "weird" like that. Make sure your husband knows he's a lucky guy. When I lived with my mother for the first half of last summer this was a typical argument.  I place my wallet keys randomly some where.  She would put them away in the key/wallet bowl.  I'd flip because she didn't leave them where I put them even if I didn't know where that place was.  You got a wonderful husband and I have a mom that knows how to deal with the shit I put up.  Now only if I can find a women that can put up with my ADHD. But remotes live under cushion covers? :P Because my phone needs to be under my pillow, my glasses must remain in that handbag, and my nail clippers need to go in that carrier bag that's in that draw under my post with the candles. This makes me feel better.  Thanks. I think you just described me perfectly. I have a one-armed pair of glasses sitting on my computer monitor stand, rigged with a ponytail loop for the armless side, for use in finding my missing glasses.

I made the mistake of buying a thin pair with muted colours, and I can actually stare right at the spot and not see them until I'm a few inches away. I used to "lose" them on my pillow / bedcover / desk at least twice a week because of this. All. The. Time. What's Find my iPhone? I'm so glad I'm not the only one doing this on my motorcycle as well.
Also +1 for another ADHD+rideit redditor Allow me to make an analogy from computer science. ADHD includes a working memory deficit. When your mental state machine is so incredibly brittle, you compensate by keeping that state externally- either stored textually as lists or as material cues to the task you were working on. If I am working on a home maintenance project and I leave the tools arrayed on the floor when I take a break for lunch, I am recording my state implicitly in the arrangement. When I return, I can resume where I left off. If someone tidys up while I'm away, my state is destroyed and I have to re-construct what was going on when I left. How dare you put shoes with other shoes!  My flip flops live under my desk, under the couch side table, under the coffee table ... basically every where but where the shoes are suppose to go in the foyer. I'm the one who's lucky.  He's gotta put up with all the ADHDness.  :) and on the floor, and on the desk, and by the phone, and in my pocket, and... ;) There's an app for iPhones that allows you to make it beep even when the phone is on silent. I used to use googlevoice to call my old cell phone, but I always forget to turn on the ringer in the morning, so that doesn't work with this one.

After I posted last night, I lost my glasses *twice* within an hour. I felt even more ridiculous than usual. :( +1! **wave**
 YES! I have to leave all the tabs up on my laptop if I'm writing assignment if I take a break, even if I've gotten all the information from them, of don't need them at all, they *need* to be there.  OMG, this is it exactly! I never thought of it this way.  The worst thing someone can do is try and "help" clean up along the way when I am in the middle of something. And on a plate in the fridge next to the butter..... Aww poor fiend :( Twice within an hour? That has to be a record.. I absolutely HATE when people put my stuff away... leave it where I left it! 

also... if you clean my office I'm going to be forced to freak out. Don't touch it! if its here then I'll find it! STAY AWAY!!!!  as long as its not in the mircowave... came WAY to close to that happening WAY to many times lol...

"Why is my spaghetti still there on the counter... whats in the.. oh crap!"
 And **Never** get rid of my stuff; I need that corner of a piece of a receipt that was under that DVD case, it had that important information on it. I'm sure hungry, better make me something to eat, why didn't I eat earlier, I'm sure I was going to microwave something. 

Next day: Why is there food in the microwave...oh "It will be fine, the microwave will beep when my food is ready"... 3 conference calls later walk over and the time is still showing.. oops forgot to push start I guess... walk away again without pushing start and go back 3 hours later, make dinner only to realize the exact same thing is still in the microwave from lunch...
