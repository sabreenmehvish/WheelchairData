Getting diagnosed tomorrow. Requesting others viewpoints on if I'm overthinking this. **EDIT AFTER FINISHING WRITING:** *So, I took a lot of time writing this, and I've never written out a long post like this, but recently this topic peaked a major interest in me in hopes I'll be able to be "healed". I'm sorry it's a bit of a long post, and if there's errors, also if some of it isn't relevant. I tried mashing up the important parts, but there's way too much in my life to explain every moment, as anyones is. Oh! Also, I don't think I mentioned it the entire time, but I'm a girl. I'm also very open if anyone has any questions, thank you!*

**TL;DR** : Never was able to pay attention to important things I've wanted to do in my life, tried everything to help it, changed my life completely and still unable to go about doing what I want.

&nbsp;

About a week ago, I wrote something into google like, *"why am I unable to watch a movie without zoning out?"* and it lead me to a page where someone asked a similar question. One of the answers that was given was that the user had a form of ADHD.  I usually put similar questions into google if I ever feel alone on a problem, and it helps me understand more of the issue I'm dealing with by other people's answers. But for whatever reason, I never got an answer that implied a concern I had was due to ADHD. So since it was a new door for me to open, I researched more of what the symptoms were and began piecing together the big issues I had from my past, and to now. 

&nbsp;

So I've been really interested in seeing if ADHD was the issue I was having to deal with most of my life, and would love if someone shared their thoughts and response to this post. Tomorrow I scheduled a doctors appointment with a psychiatrist to get diagnosed. But I've also been worried that I'm overthinking everything, so I feel asking someone who is actually diagnosed with ADHD would help me figure out what to think when heading into the doctor's office.  I'm going to try to list everything I can remember from my earliest memories, to now that could relate to me maybe having ADHD as the issue.

&nbsp;

**Some brief backstory on Parents**

I was the last child born out of the two. My father had 2 children with another woman, left the family and got together with my mom. My mother already had one child when they met, as he was a result of incest she had with her brother.  When they got together they had three more children, including me. So to make the post a bit easier to read, I'll assign the 3 closest brothers names: 

* Peter (Oldest Brother, the one resulted of incest)

* Michael (Second Oldest Full Brother)

* James (Third Oldest Full Brother)

My parents both had bad pasts, and turned into rebellious drug-addicts and alcoholics at a very young age. Alcohol was both their main issue and the addiction even carried throughout my mother's pregnancies. All my brothers are born fetal alcohol syndrome, myself included (more explained about this later). Before I was born, my brothers got taken away by the ministry and put into foster care. So both of them left and moved to another city, where I was born. 

&nbsp;

**Birth - Preschool** 

Immediately I got taken from the hospital and put into a foster home, this took place while my parents were in the middle of breaking up. So they officially called it quits and this resulted in a court date for custody of me, which my mother never showed up to. My father ended up gaining custody of me to which he quit drinking, and drugs all together to raise me. My mother left town and my father and I stayed in a very small house that we shared with low-income tenants below us (usually drug-addicts). Down the street was a child development centre (preschool) which I attended due to doctor's concerns of my fetal alcohol syndrome. 

I felt like I was a normal kid in preschool, nothing out of the normal that a child wouldn't do. I do remember one day where I saw one of the bigger girls having a fun tease fight with one of the teachers, where she would jokingly say, *"you're stupid!"*, as the teacher would respond with, *"no, youuu're stupid!"* (Thinking back to this now, it's a bit of a weird thing to say to each other, I wish I remembered more context) So while we were on lunch break, I randomly blurted out to that same teacher that she was stupid, to which she responded that what I said wasn't nice. I remember being confused to why I didn't get a comfort-loving response, but thinking about it now makes me laugh.

When I finished this schooling, the teachers told my father that the fetal alcohol syndrome wasn't an issue anymore, as it would stop developing from here on out. He told me that he didn't believe what they were saying, because he felt that "a disease couldn't just go away like that", but he trusted what they said and continued to put me through normal public schooling. 

&nbsp;

**Kindergarten - Grade 3**  

[Copy of Permanent Record recording days absent, and grading](https://imgur.com/a/tBvey34)

&nbsp;

So I don't remember why I began missing so many days, but this continued all throughout my school life. A lot of what I missed was excused for, and wasn't recorded to my records. I do remember that I was able to enjoy work though, but since my father wasn't harsh on my attendance, I would make excuses to stay home. This made a huge impact on my socializing period, and early education.

During kindergarten, I remember getting into trouble quite frequently. I remember in kindergarten my teacher asking me why I couldn't be like the other kids (I'm sure she didn't mean it harshly), as I would act up during lessons and story time. I don't remember having much interest in math, but my PR states differently, which I find funny. I was more of an arts kid, and made friends by sharing my art skills with others in the class. 

I was in the same class for grade 1 & 2, where I would get into trouble more often. I also wouldn't eat the lunches my father provided. I was that kid who would shove their sandwiches in their desk until they would rot and mold, my backpack was another stash spot for that. 

There was a time where I had a huge scab on my knee, and when it was storytime, out of nowhere I began licking it and someone pointed it out to the teacher. I have no explanation behind that. 

Grade 3 I continued to disinterest myself with academic courses, because I "didn't get it". I would pass assignments by copying others work, or by half-assing the work, never putting in full effort. I wasn't able to ever participate fully in the novel-study discussions because I would never read the book, or even put effort into forcing myself to do it. When I would get home, my father never checked if I had homework so I never did it. 

&nbsp;

**Grade 4-5**
[Permanent Record](https://imgur.com/a/xmueEmj)

&nbsp;

I don't have grade's 4 records, but the year was very similar to grade 3. I would continue not doing assignments, and put no effort into schooling.

For grade 5, I began gaining interest in animation and art, and would make youtube animations based off of Naruto FanFlashes, but with my friends involved. I mainly did this because of praise of how well I did. But this contributed to the fact I never did work. As the year would go along, I wouldn't want to show up to school because I didn't understand the subjects, and how fast we were going, also this was the time where I grew self conscious over my image. I rotated between very few articles of clothing and felt embarrassment over the fact I never brushed my hair or teeth. I did end up getting a good grade for each subject at the end of the year, although most of the B's were in the lower-area. 

My home life stayed the same, except my father began online dating at this time and the various amounts of women entering and leaving the house started. To escape from this home-life, and school life, I started a fake-online profile and made online friends on a site called Habbo. I was unable to bring real life friends to my house because I felt ashamed of how dirty it was, also the fact that I didn't have any close friends. I found it easier to talk to people online, especially behind a mask.  

&nbsp;

**Grade 6 - 7**
[Grade 6 PR](https://imgur.com/a/xyxkr8g) [Grade 7 PR](https://imgur.com/a/rmVwGy9)

&nbsp;

I got my first suspension in grade 6, and it was for making an animation about me hitting my teacher over the head with a spoon. The principal thought the best execution for this was to suspend me for 4 days, and make me delete my youtube channel. They told my father they would monitor my channel from here on out. I stopped animating after this and didn't touch it afterwards. 

Grade 7 was the last year of my elementary school life, to which I remember gaining more anxiety over things. Before, I didn't feel much pressure about not doing school work, but now I did. We would be assigned to do work to prep us for highschool, and even though I wanted to do it, I never would. I didn't know how to study since I never really DID. I never prepped before tests. I wasn't able to focus myself on the subject, as I had more interest in the people's lives around me (This might just be due to not having many friends). However, I did take notice that whenever I would do work, I would do an excellent job at it. Like, to a point where I even impressed myself. Continuing through the year, I started to put effort into as many assignments as I could, but I'd only ever be able to do it at school, as I wasn't able to focus at home at all. This got me to where my grades are, but I still hated novel study. I got frustrated with being unable to put my attention into books, or creating the "image" in my head. But I pulled through one book that year, which was the first book I ever completely read through, and I was actually able to create a bit of a "movie" in my head of the book. I was proud of myself, but still scared for highschool.

Home life was getting worse though, my father was giving up more slowly and getting more and more verbally abusive. I would refuse to do chores at home, and he would say that I'm lazy just like my mom. That never hurt me, as I didn't know who she was. But his parenting technique was to shame me rather than teach me why what I was doing was wrong. I would get yelled at quite often, he had anger issues due to his addictions and past. During these times, I would stay on the computer and try to make friends there. 

&nbsp;

**Grade 8 - 9** 
[Grade 8 PR](https://imgur.com/a/06NaBHX) [Grade 9 PR](https://imgur.com/a/24G3pJd)

&nbsp;

Transitioning into highschool was hard for me. My motivation dropped and my grades slipped pretty bad. I got overwhelmed with the amount of people, and tried to stay away from school as much as possible. The records don't show how many times I was ascent, but it was a large amount of days. It was the same routine as elementary.. go to school, try my hardest to zone myself out of the teacher talking (I didn't understand the lesson anyway, I just got to the point of not wanting to hear them), then I would go home and ignore homework. 

Grade 9 got worse, to where I would develop identity issues(?) (I'm not sure what to call this, but my mental health took a bad turn.) This was around 2012, when the Aurora movie theatre shooting happened. When I heard this news, I grew attraction to the face of the murderer, and this caused me to brainwash myself into believing that his actions were okay. I grew my identity around murderers, and would post it to social media often. I had a [tumblr](http://dzhokhars.tumblr.com/archive/2012/8) that was devoted to my thoughts of them, which quickly grew to me wanting to go about the same actions. This was 100% for attention, and desperation for love from others. It was the worst way I could go about it, but in my head "any attention was good attention." I had the shooter as my phone wallpaper when one of the teachers found it, and sent me to counselling. This was my first ever time with a counsellor, and to be completely honest it was the one thing that changed my life drastically. 

She dug into the topic of why I had attraction towards these types of people, and why my grades were so bad (I failed math 9 that year). After a few sessions with her for a few weeks, she pointed that the root cause to these issues were due to my home life, mainly the mental stress my dad was putting upon me. She proceeded to assign an actual counsellor to me that I could see outside of school. 

I told my new counsellor all about my past, and why I suddenly had all these new thoughts. She suggested that I may have depression, and would like to further work on helping me with it. I agreed to her doing so. 

&nbsp;

**Grade 10**
[Grade 10 PR](https://imgur.com/a/SjDnkpW)

&nbsp;

This was the year I ended up seeing a boy I liked, and he did insanely well in academics. So combine that with new counselling, I ended up focusing myself more on school, and I even ended up dating him in the end. I still wasn't able to do well on tests, and that was the main reason I never got A's. I never ever studied, but began handing work on time and actually putting effort into it. 

After doing okay in math 9, I got cocky and put myself into a higher-leveled math and didn't do too well in it. I didn't grasp the ideas yet still wanted to maintain the title of being in it. 

When grade 10 came to an end, I got back into the habit of not caring. When grade 11 hit, I didn't show up at all, I even got the the point of dropping out that year. I really began to believe I had depression at this point, as I refused to believe that I had it before. I never wanted to "group myself in" with people who legitimately had it. I didn't have any skills, because I never truly invested time into doing one as a kid, so I felt like I had nothing to show for, except my mediocre art. This caused me to think little of myself, and I dropped into a hole of self loathing of not knowing who I was or why I was here. I became suicidal and started to plan out killing myself before age 20. But what intrigued me was who I was, and I wanted to figure that out before I killed myself. So that became my new goal. 



As I continued seeing my counsellor, I never really told her my true intentions of killing myself, because I didn't want to "heal" that idea. I wanted to stick to it because I was sick of my life. I felt like I absolutely needed to do it. So continuing the sessions, my counsellor figured that the root cause of my depression and dropping out was the house that I lived in. I remind you that drug-addicts rented out the basement, and it was a very small place. My father rarely cleaned, as I didn't either. I never showed my boyfriend where I lived, and would get him to drop me off close to the house rather than let him see where I lived. Anyway, she decided before having me try out anti-depressants, she wanted to test if I had "environmental depression", and wanted to see if I would do better elsewhere. 


I contacted my great aunt who lived 10 hours away, and long story short she agreed that my father wasn't the best figure to help me with schooling, so she agreed to let me live with her for a year to finish grade 11. 

&nbsp;

**Grade 11**
[Grade 11 PR](https://imgur.com/a/EtczXQ4)

&nbsp;

I've never travelled as a child, so this was my first time really seeing the real world. I was 17 at this point. Moving in with my great aunt taught me what a big loving family actually was, because I truly never understood that feeling. During my time there, I had my own large room on this beautiful 10-acre property. There were so many greens, and the people who lived in this area were much different from the ones where I lived. Before schooling started, I was almost certain that getting out of the bad environment I was in would help me get my grades to the point where they should be, I had a really nice study desk in my room also. I even decided to enrol myself in Pre-Calculus math because I wanted my full potential to shine. It was paradise to me. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't the solution. I noticed that even though I would take my homework home, and even TRY to study, I was unable to do so. I would rather distract myself by going on the computer, or watching TV. I would get massive anxiety over what I was doing, so I would then eat to get rid of those feelings. Due to my actions, my aunt noticed I was slipping in math. She threatened that I'd have to leave if I didn't pass. It got to the point where I would stay in my math class every lunch, and pretend to study. I would sit there with my books open, paper and everything, but just doodle and go on my phone. Not even a threat to remove my paradise could make me study, and I never understood that. My math teacher noticed I came in every lunch, and started to make small talk with me. I eventually told her about my situation with my aunt, and how I might not be here next semester. I think she took this to heart a bit much, because my ending grade was 2% below passing, but she told me she bumped it up because she felt I tried my hardest (hence not actually studying during lunch..) I really did appreciate what she did for me though. 

During my second semester, I still wanted to stick with my plan of figuring out who I was, so I began to hunt down my mother. I had the password to my dads facebook, so I went through his messages to the one I had my mind on. I remember seeing this message on his account when I was younger, and it was James' (Second oldest brother) adoptive mother contacting him to ask if he wanted to be in contact with his son, he had no interest so never messaged back. I ended up finding the message and jotted down her name, and tried contacting her. 

When she messaged back, she was hesitant because of how my father responded. I assured her I was different, and I got to talk to my brother for the first time. He gave me Peter's number and I got ahold of him, to which I obtained my mother's number (This was all over the span of 3 months). When I spoke to her for the first time, I didn't rage, but was rather curious to what her life was like. She gave me her answers and I cut my connection to her as I quickly realized that she didn't change her lifestyle what so ever. 

After finishing my schooling, I had to move back. I felt angry at the world that I had to move back with my dad, so I didn't continue schooling and didn't finish highschool. 

&nbsp;

**Fast Forward To Now**

So, 2 year time-skip. I'm 20 now. And I moved out of my father's house after a few months of moving back in with him. I live with my boyfriend, and I'm having a bit of issues on being how I perceive as "normal" (Don't know a better word to use)

So, realizing that even after learning about my mother, and leaving my father, I still had issues dealing with things that I felt should've been fixed. I still had no motivation, and I had constant thoughts of depression and suicidal thoughts daily. It got to the point where I couldn't handle it anymore so I finally went to a doctor to get anti-depressants. After doing so, I've been able to see my issues in a 3rd-person view rather than a 1st-person view (if that makes sense). I'm able to understand WHY I had depressive thoughts, rather than listening to what they had to say. It made me view my issues a lot differently. After doing this, I decided to re-enroll in highschool to complete it. 

Now here's where I'm having issues, even with depression medication, another beautiful environment, and a loving boyfriend, I'm still unable to put effort into what I want to do. I've overcome my suicidal thoughts completely, and freed myself from the thought and cycle of "not wanting to do work". But yet, I still can't focus on going forth with my plans. I want to finish highschool, and I'm 2 courses away from completing it, but I am currently still putting it off. Even with the thoughts of, "I'm GOING to do this after work" I still don't. I want to go forth with college and get into Psychiatric Nursing, but I'm scared I'll continue my habits that I had throughout my life. I have a constant feeling that being lazy is ruining my life, because the "big ideas" I have in my head for myself are pointing at me laughing, knowing I'll never do them. I don't want to head back into depression because of this, and I'm frustrated that I'll end up like my parents if I never figure out why I'm like this. I can't even focus and enjoy movies, I zone out and can't keep up with the story or plot at all. I do this often, even in conversation. Recently, I've been taking caffeine pills before work because I convinced myself I am a naturally drowsy person. Without the caffeine, I'm unable to be my true self, and can't have a proper thinking process as it feels too spaced, and slow. 


&nbsp;

But I think I'll stop here, and thank you if you've read most of it. I've booked the appointment for tomorrow as I'm wondering if I might have ADHD. I'm also very tired after writing this, I didn't even think I'd do it. I tried using a thesaurus for some words to keep it interesting, so sorry if my writing style got a bit repetitive. 















  I'm so sorry you've had to go through all of this, it sounds like it was a really hard time growing up. I would first like to say, you are not alone. I've felt this way throughout school my entire life. Always wanting to do well, making plans and telling myself "I WILL study tonight!" and then come home and not study. I would get so angry at myself (and still do, honestly) and always ask why the hell I can't just be like everyone else and have the motivation to do things that are important? I dropped out of college after the first year, and two community colleges after that. I'm finishing a 1 year intensive bootcamp for web design, and the only reason I'm actually going to finish (even though I'm crazy behind) is because my boyfriend keeps me on track. If I didn't have him, I'm 100% certain I wouldn't have finished this either. It's taken me over 8 months for a psychiatrist to believe me that it could be ADHD and not just my anxiety disorder causing these issues. I've done a ton of research and reading all of these reddit comments makes me feel so much better knowing I'm not alone, and there IS a reason I'm like this, and it's not just a character flaw. So to answer your question, I absolutely believe you have a reason to get help for ADD/ADHD and I don't think you are overthinking it. I hope you find the help you deserve, and if you feel like you don't get the correct answer from the first doctor, don't hold back from getting a second opinion.  As I am tired as well I won't read this whole thing, but here's what I will say, you may have ADD or ADHD, ADD if you don't display signs of hyperactivity like fidgeting and more often just tend to zone out and lose focus. Don't over think it, if you think you have it, you most likely do, this is something I doubted within myself for the longest time, and after taking the medication, I realized it's something I should've done years ago. In my personal experience I always had this haze in my mind, it's like this thing that keeps you from thinking straight or concentrating, it's the reason why studying was so painful for me, this typically is the result from the lack of dopamine your brain releases even for simple tasks, no matter how important something may be, you just don't feel any reward in it no matter how hard you try. I tend to zone out in certain situations, but after taking the medication I just feel like a productive person working towards my goals, the haze gets taken away, and concentrating and studying in my case no longer feels like a chore. Just be honest about what you're experiencing, the psychiatrist is an expert in this field and it's not as trivial or complicated as it seems. Thank you - It's really warming to know that I'm not alone on this. I'm happy to know that there's other pushing through the same difficulties, and accomplishing their goals. I'm a little worried on what I'm going to say to the doctor tomorrow as I get nervous about this kind of stuff, do you have any tips on what seeing the doctor about this type of thing is like? Again, thank you for reading! This is what I'm hoping for. I'm a bit nervous on what the doctor will say, but my hopes are to go with treatment to help motivate myself further. I've read some posts online about how people turned their life around just by getting diagnosed and medicated. The one thing that turned me away from this was the fact my boyfriend also has ADHD, and refuses to continue his meds because he felt like it changed his personality completely. So that being the only source of opinion I had on ADHD, I never thought anything good of it. I'm glad I'm opening my mind to this though, because it's helping me gain confidence to understand my own issues and help others. Thank you! I've felt the exact same way talking to my doctors before, and I feel like my ADD inhibited me from truly explaining my symptoms because I forget them all in the moment. If you feel like you're nervous, or may forget what to talk about, it doesn't hurt to write all of your feelings down before you talk with them! Even just bring the main points of your post on here to your appointment. I think once you explain your background and how it's still affecting you, your psychiatrist should have some answers for you. Good luck :)  Everyone responds to the medication differently, and often it's about finding the right one, I personally prefer dexedrine and zenzedi above all the others.
