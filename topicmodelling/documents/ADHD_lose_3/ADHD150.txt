What activites make you hyperfocus? I'll start:

* Sound design and playing around with synthesizers.
* Reading fiction. Especially fantasy, but it can be anything so long as I like it.
* Planning the modular synthesizer I will never be able to afford.
* Daydreams.

&#x200B; Please realize that "hyperfocus" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology\)) and [perseveration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseveration#Other_Neurological_conditions).

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost *all* people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD

Perseveration, on the other hand, *is* part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else. Daydreams, reading a good fic, my job sometimes when I really get a good flow going, and drawing when Iâ€™m actually motivated to do so.  Video games, just got done with life is strange, man what an awesome story. And it's now 3 o'clock when it was just 12 lol. 

Certain types of genre's in entertainment (movies, books, TV shows), such as action and horror.

YouTube rabbit holes.
To name a few.
 I just spent about 16 hours programing. I feel like shit and I'm probably dehydrated  I daydream most of the day (I also subscribe to r/MaladaptiveDreaming).

Online window shopping...I have like 800 Amazon wish lists and Pinterest boards.

I also LOVE drafting and design.  Starting probably around age 7 or 8 I would have my parents buy me house plan books (this was the early 90s so pre-internet in my household) and I would draft them up on graph paper and change the design to my liking.  Over the years this evolved to using CADD programs.  I'm still kicking myself that I didn't pursue this as a career.  Unfortunately it's too late since I'm too broke to go back to school and I now have terrible carpal tunnel from a decade of shitty data entry sweatshop jobs. I *love* modular synthesis, even though Iâ€™ll never be able to afford it. You should check out [VCV](https://vcvrack.com), a virtual modular synthesizer.  For me it's very difficult/repetitive tasks. So specific games like Geometry Dash/the impossible game/dark souls, or a really tough boulder problem or sequence (I rock climb frequently). I will do the same action for hours on end until I succeed or make some type of progress. But besides that if I come up with some idea for an app or a fiction story I can expand on it for hours just analyzing it from every angle! day dreaming, playing my flute (im a music ed major so i practice like 1-2 hours everyday, sometimes more), reading a good ass fic, watching my friends stream on twitch, watching a good show.  Reddit is the thing i spend most of my time on without meaning to

If I like a tv show Iâ€™ll watch it until I canâ€™t. E.g. My iPad dies, even then Iâ€™ll probably just find another way of watching it

Some video games I play for hours on end, my current obsession is RDR2 but Iâ€™m really looking forward to getting addicted to HITMAN2 also

 Live action combat orientated games/sports such as Larp, HvZ, and martial arts. Once I'm in that grove it can take days to escape. Sometimes weeks. Open world video games (lately legend of Zelda: breath of the wild), ukulele, painting and/or drawing, learning a language (I know parts of many languages haha oops) YouTube videos (on a myriad of topics from skincare to pre-history lol), and linguistics. Also a good fantasy novel if I can get my hands on it, but itâ€™s so much rarer now in my 20â€™s than it was when I was about 10. When I was in middle school I used to stay up until 4 am reading things like lord of the rings just for fun (and because I could. Not. Stop.! You know the drill)  Specific video games (I'll forget to go to the loo), editing photos, reading, getting fixated on which ever topic/product I'm into that month. Will literally forget all about it after a few weeks (& after spending too much money) Good bot. > i just spent about 16 hours programing. i feel like crap and i'm probably dehydrated 


Purified It's never too late. With the Internet everything is possible. Learn yourself the things you want, it's possible.  I was just about to suggest this! Audio is one of mine, too... I can spend hours listening to and tweaking a snare crack until it's perfect, my coursework never seems to get done until last minute, though... ðŸ˜¬  I just started getting into rock climbing!I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing but have access to shoes, chalk, and a climbing wall/boulders.Classes are extra and rather expensive though.
Iâ€™ve  watched some videos on YouTube on form and hand/leg placement but feel all that info will disappear as soon as I get in the gym lol.
 I'm not a bot, but thanks I guess. I'm definitely thinking about adding this as an automatic reply to our automoderator config, tho. Explaining this all the time sure does get old. Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99966% sure that nerdshark is not a bot.
