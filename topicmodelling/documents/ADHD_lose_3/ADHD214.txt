[Ranting] Lost my wallet So I lost my wallet this morning, which is the sad part.

On the positive side, I never trusted myself enough to put most of my identification in my wallet out of a fear of losing it ... Iâ€™ve literally just lost mine like 5mins ago and had everything in it like so much money aswell !  If you cannot find it by tracing your steps, don't forget to call your banks to cancel your card and your police department in case someone finds it.
