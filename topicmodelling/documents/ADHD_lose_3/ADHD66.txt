What was I just thinking about?  Do you ever lose your train of thought, then try to retrace it, or just "shut down" as a result? I have a lot on my mind lately -work deadlines, bills, my social/love life, business trip next week, vacation after that- not to mention a few things I'm behind on.

Earlier this morning I was working on some SQL code for work.  Within a few seconds I got distracted by: 2 instant messages, something going on outside my window, my upstairs neighbor dropped something, another neighbor was just leaving through the front door, checking my calendar concerning the business trip next week, something on the TV that caught my attention, at least one other thing I can't remember, and then back to the code.  

That all literally happened within just a few seconds.  Then I found myself thinking, "now what was I just thinking about?"  I had ["tip of the tongue syndrome"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue) about my own stream of consciousness. And I had a very distinct feeling of overwhelming hopelessness in the face of straightening it all out.  

This was about an hour after I took my morning dose of Adderall.  I believe I actually had a mini panic attack.  I couldn't focus, my heart was racing and all I cared about was what stupid trivial thing was just on my mind a few moments prior, because it seemed like the most important thing in the world.  Even though I have a ton of work to do, I just didn't care anymore.  I walked away from my work computer, poured myself a drink, took a shower, and I've been laying in bed on the internet ever since.

Now, when I step back and think about it logically, I realize the stream of consciousness isn't really that important.  I have a to-do list and never really forget the important things anyway.  

But in the moment, that "what was I just thinking about" feeling is so incredibly powerful, it completely depletes my motivation for anything and everything.  All consuming.  It's been happening to me for years, and was originally why I sought help in the first place and was subsequently diagnosed with ADD just over a year ago. 

Whenever a thought does pop back into my head, it's always something trivial. "Oh, I was thinking of a quote from a movie," or "oh yeah, I was going to see if new socks are on sale."  

So... sound familiar?  Does this happen to anyone else?   Happens to me all the time, but usually I am talking to someone and my thought completely evades me and I am left speechless and embarrassed, only to remember hours or days later the thought I was thinking and wanted to share was totally irrelevant and stupid.  I love my rambling tangential brain because I hop between so many thoughts so frequently. The more important those thoughts are the more I have them until they eventually become important enough to value innately. And being rambling and tangential means I make more inferences between things I learn to value, which makes me think smarter and more abstractly. 

I try to remove distraction from my environment when I want to focus on something. No music, no tv, all message windows closed, all phones and other noisy things off. It is hard enough to get myself to begin working, and every time one of these things distracts me I have to start all over. If I listen to music, the most I will do is chat on reddit or go for a walk, but when I listen to classical I do nothing else. Listening to classical this way really helped my overall focus, even without medication. 

When I have the free time to try to remember something, it's more a puzzle. I never really care that much that I forgot something, because if my brain let me forget it, it probably wasn't super important anyway. If it is important, there will be consequences and that will be set in memory. I would rather not forget important things, but that is a part of life. You usually have to experience a bit of pain and suffering in order to figure out what is really important and worthy of keeping in mind.  Every minute of the day.  All the time, and when I try to return to the to-do list, I have a momentary freak-out of "Where was I on that last task, and how in the heck do I get back into it if I can't remember?" 

Sometimes I remember and sometimes I just start over until I find my place and resume my original pace, but there's always the feeling that I already did something and forgot, or that I totally skipped a step. So, a general distrust of my distracted brain. :\  All the time man! Not the panic attack feeling, but once I forget what I'm doing, scumbag brain is often like "let's go hang out and not do work!" I notice that I'm getting better at finding my original train of thought when I'm talking with people and get sidetracked, so perhaps talking to myself might help...? [deleted] Awesome! You articulated how you manage the chaotic brilliance very well. Very positively too which is important. You could  email that to Edward Hallowell it would probably make it in his next ADHD book. :-)  Either way, it really clicked with me! YES! I start a story, that leads into another story, that leads into another story, until I forget what the original fucking story was. That is where I forget what I am talking about. I have learned to make these sound bites when possible. I will plan out the basic structure of what I am about to say, for example **this became this** is how I will have it in my head so that when I talk about my day at the park it becomes

&gt;  First we got there...and...and...and...*everything was nice*...and...and...and...*then it was less nice when it started raining* so...and...and...

So with luck, keeping *this becomes this* in my mind, you'd see that I was able to remember the point of what I was trying to say: **the weather became shit.** I was even able to ramble in between a bit. :-)
