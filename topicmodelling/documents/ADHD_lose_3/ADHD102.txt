Paradoxes of ADHD - And how I deal with them Based on my own experience about living with ADHD-PI. The list is limited to my own experiences and coping strategies, feel free to comment yours. I didn't make a tl;dr but I hope some **highlighting** makes the text understandable at a glance.

ADHD makes me forget.  
**guilt**  
*I need reminders.*

Anxiety makes me not want to try.  
**shame**  
*Reminders often remind me I failed to act.*

While **to-do lists often help** me a great deal, they are **counterproductive** when there is **no time limit or** when my anxiety overshadows my **motivation** to act. The guilt and shame it can bring has been devastating in my life. Try to **redirect these forces pushing you away** from your to-do **to healthy activities**. Try to go for a jog, overhaul the messy organisation of your bedroom or challenge yourself to make the healthiest food you ever made.  
*For example:* I really need to write my paper but I don't have the time or sources to be able to (I'm sure I will fail). Let's make a huge post about my experience with ADHD to help others.  
As a result, you will possibly feel more pressure to start but in general you should feel better, [reducing that anxiety and making you function better](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adult-adhd-and-exercise). **I advice this as a lifestyle and not a one time wonder thing.**

Failure makes me lose faith in myself.  
**depression**  
*I need short-term, realistic goals.*

Success leaves me feeling empty and lost.  
**aimlessness**  
*I need long-term, unreachable goal, keeping me engaged forever.*

I often feel **sad about failing** to succeed, mainly when it's due to anxiety or forgetfulness. Success usually only gives me a minor mood boost. To often, **I judge my successes to be 'how it should be'**, while seeing **failure to be a personal failure**. Compliments only affect me in a good way if I'm proud, otherwise they just makes me feel awkward. While I have a lot of difficulty setting and remembering long-term goals (the comments may include advice for that), achieving a short-term goal is really a lot easier if you **divide it in manageable sub-goals**. Not only has it worked to achieve those goals, **it didn't affect me as much if I failed at sub-goal 4**. The 'meta-thinking' about achieving my goal also helps with the inevitable "What now?" if I do finish, making **easier to set new goal as a continuation of the old one**.

Highlighting my differences alienates me.  
**self imposed isolation**  
*Others make me feel abnormal.*

Highlighting I'm normal and have the same problems as 'the rest of us' makes me appear lazy.  
**ununderstood**  
*Stop trying to convince me I'm a 'normie'.*

Every ADHD'er I've spoken to knew the horrible tendency some people have to say things like: "Well I'm also forgetful, that's why I use to-do lists, you should try it!". If I follow that logic, it **ends up in doubt** (do I have ADHD? Am I not just lazy?) even though I have been tested extensively and the psychiatrist concluded that I do. It **makes me feel bad**. It also makes me feel bad if I feel so different that I have **trouble connecting** to people. To be honest, the only advice I can come up with is that you need people with similar burdens, interests and characters as you. How you to find these people irl? No idea, haven't found any strategies for that one. Online there are youtube channels like how to ADHD and amazing communities like this one!

Just lurking this sub alone has been a tremendous help. I hope to return the favour :).

Edit: typo fix … Are you me?

 Seriously, great post! This helped me by letting me know I'm not alone in all these little details.  With the guidance of your post as a reflection of my issues, I think I can tweak my GTD process to reward me in the way my brain expects, not the way other people do.  I love that you separated these into sections and used bold. Also, all of these are super relatable.

I also love when my mom says “well everyone has that problem in their own ways!” Or “that’s normal.” .... Mom maybe it’s normal because you also have ADHD but wouldn’t want to admit that. Lol  Great, great post. So spot on for me. When someone tells me, "Just make a to-do list or use a planner.." I'm screaming inside, "You just solved all of my problems! I can't believe I've tried those exact remedies hundreds of times!!" Like at this very moment, I have an overwhelming list of things my brain has told me I should do. I have a planner that I seem to add things to but never get to scratch them out. Projects that need to be started. Projects that need to be finished. Nifty ideas. Plans and plans and more plans. Goals, and goals, and goals. YET, here I sit. In the silence of my room. Comfortable. Ready to negotiate the days proactive participation, and my brain is like a selfish three year old with her arms crossed and her little pig tails swinging side to side saying, "Nope. Nope. Nope. I not doing that." I feel stuck.   Bit overwhelmed by the relatability and the way you wrote this. Dont know what else to say than thanks > Reminders often remind me I failed to act.

Owwwwww it hurts. And creates the vicious cycle. This is one of my absolute biggest issues, for both the smaller tasks that just trigger immediate overwhelm even though they're so minor, as well as the bigger long-term things I need to do but are either daunting or don't have a hard deadline in the immediate future. I have autism and ADHD. With regards to your goal setting, are use a website called Asana. It has been really helpful to me, because it has an infinite layer of subtasks within subtasks, if that makes sense.

To help me in my day-to-day life, I use a lot of different strategies that you might find helpful. For example, to read this post are used the iPhones inbuilt accessibility settings to have it read out loud to me. I am writing this comment using dictation because it easier for me than typing and I get much less overwhelmed.

Having autism as well as ADHD has helped me embrace the fact that I am technically disabled. I think this is key in not feeling shame for things I can’t do. I find it very difficult to do daily tasks, and simple things that everybody else can do but I can’t. Having something that is more widely known as a disability and not using it as an excuse has really strengthened the way that I feel about myself. I have realised that it’s okay to be disabled, and there’s nothing wrong with needing to do do things in a different way. I used to feel like a fraud for calling myself disabled, but now I realise it’s just a simple fact and that there are degrees of disability. Technically where I am from ADHD alone is counted as a disability in the disability equality act.

I worked very hard in eradicating shame in my life. For me this comes from writing very simple and achievable to do lists, and having a separate list for the things that I could do if I finish my first list. This really helps me because I can easily finish the tasks on my essential list, and if I feel good that day I can get much more done. It does help that I love my job, and I also love the degree I’m doing.

I never forget things like my keys any more because I have conditioned myself but if I don’t physically see and touch them before I leave the door, in my head I don’t have them. So every day before I leave the house I check my pockets for the essentials, such as my keys, my phone, my work pass, and my headphones. This strategy is really helpful for me because it really eradicates the anxiety of not being ready in the morning.

I use an app called 3030. I use it for routines. I have my morning routine, my nighttime routine, and I have my routine for when I get home from work. Otherwise I forget what I’m doing in the middle of a task, and I end up doddering around and not really doing anything productive. 

As far as studying goes, I find the Pomodoro technique very useful. It Gives me small breaks, which help me a lot to not burn out. I also segment my study into a lot of different sections. I study maths, so it’s probably a lot simpler for me, but are use a Filofax refillable notebook and I have various sections depending on the type of notes I’m taking. 

As far as happiness goes, I found that the simpler my life is, the happier I am. The ADHD brain is always looking for challenge and excitement, and I always thought that this would come from having a very complicated life. But I implemented minimalism, gave myself scheduled rest time, and read a lot in the evening, and I’ve never been happier. I can now choose my challenges to keep me engaged and it’s brilliant. Are use a lot of candles, and make sure that my environment is very pleasant to be in. I had trouble with tidying, so I got rid of all my stuff and I have nothing to tidy up. Minimalism is probably one of the best things that ever happened to me.

I hope I haven’t stepped on anyone’s toes, I wouldn’t know even if I had. The joys of having autism. I hope that someone can find this helpful, And I’m happy to help with any more information if anyone wants it. I’m by no means an expert, but I like to think I have a quite a successful life.

You sound like you’re doing really well OP, and some of your tips have been really useful for me, thank you! Updoots for being too relatable. This is good stuff!  I really like how you combined the emotional and mental aspects with the skills building aspect.  I see one or the other often, but putting them together like this is really effective, thank you for sharing! 10/10 post! It's amazing to me that we can possess the ability to articulate these incredibly nuanced perspectives of our relationship to our disorder and it's impacts on our lives while simultaneously failing to do the simplest things about it...

The amount of times I've felt like I've really articulated and understood my predicament in a way that would produce lasting and meaningful change can be a bit disheartening when I look at my actual track record of being able to effect change with this new wonderfully articulated awareness of my issues. I understand my problems TOO WELL to be able to accept or feel sympathy for the shear amount of failure I've faced despite having this sense of understanding. 

When people confront me for fucking up and I lay out for them why I failed and how I can go about 'fixing' this for the future, it always seems to them (and often to myself as well) that "that should be the end of it! He knows where he went wrong and how to correct it. *Any failure from now on must have to do with his own moral laziness or unwillingness to carry out the strategies HE HIMSELF outlined as being potentially effective."* I don't even have an answer to that. This is how I still walk away from confrontations related to my ADHD symptoms feeling like a piece of shit. It isn't a problem of knowing what to do, it's a problem of being able to do what you know. This concept is something that many people (myself included) still struggle to understand even when they're reasonably educated about ADHD. 

I could write a whole book about how to overcome ADHD and it would read wonderfully and appear that I've sorted all my shit out. In reality, it would have all been some cruel thought experiment that had little to no impact on my inherent ability to self regulate and use my executive functions day to day. What is guild? Do you mean guilt? I seriously felt like I was reading all the thoughts that have been clouding my mind lately. Thank you for reminding me that I’m not guilty and I’m not alone!  >iamlessness 

I hear that.  Hey, hey, get your ass out of my head, dammit! 😉That’s so relatable to me, man.  The most important thing that I have learned is to accept my failures and to look at relative improvement, not large make-it/break-it goals. "Did I do the same or better than last week." If the answer is no, then *forgive yourself* and *try again*. Wow, that's crazily accurate So what do you do when you have trouble connecting to people?  I feel like no one understands me and I like segregate myself. This person deserves to be gilded!

 It's absolutely astounding to see how accurately we can all resonate with each other, and exposure to this forum helps remind me that there are others out there. It's hard to remind myself about this though, especially when everyone around you is intelligent and successful (have housemates that are honors students or high GPAs enjoying school) and blah blah you guys get it, I'd type more but I have a lab due at midnight. To the study cave! This describes me to a T!  I couldn't have said it any better.   Read a few pages of a book! I personally love reading but just have so much trouble getting started, reading a few pages of a book a day gives you that quick rewarding feeling of accomplishment that helps me keep focus throughout the day.  How do I save or favorite a post? I’ve been going through the exact same shit as you and never had really any tools to deal with it. My parents have given up helping me cause of my ADHD and it’s subsequent problems it causes with saying I’m gonna do something and then forgetting about it, and being called lazy so many times I’ve lost count, etc. thank you so much for these tips! Especially with the guilt/anxiety/depression/trouble connecting with others aspect

Hope things go well for you and thanks a million for the advice for everyone else with ADHD. Your comment on meta thinking made me think of Scott Adams’ (Dilbert) views and approach on systems thinking. He’s been interviewed on a few podcasts where he discusses this (e.g. Tim Ferris, James Altucher) and has a book on the subject (How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life) Hello me. I legit struggle with this daily!

Currently lying on a pile of clothes im sorting out for the opshop. 'But I like all of them. fook.' Wow ! I can familiarize a-thousand-percent. Thanms for articulating this so well. Do you ever try to get yourself into a good "headspace"? Like, I'll listen to music before work because I'm more likely to get stuff done than if I had listened to a podcast or watched YouTube. Thank you for this. I’ve been feeling particularly lost, alone and hopeless to ever gain ground...against myself, I guess. 

It’s really helpful to hear the same struggles from outside my own head, makes them less powerful somehow.   I can really relate to a lot of these.   One advice that i took from a book that made sense to me:   Have broad long term goals,  and specific short term goals.   Having a long term goal of "lose 30 pounds" is too specific and implies that anything less is failure.  Having a broad long term goal of "eat healthier" or other broad categories implies that even small progress is still a step towards that goal.   Too specific and you're implying that if you only lose 29 pounds you completely failed.  

Specific short term goals though,  I have to do X by tonight.  Too broad of a short term goal and you'll poke holes through it.   Specific goals should however be about a process and not about a result.   Saying "I will write a great blog post" says that anything short of perfection is not worth trying,  but saying "write 500 words,  even if they're shitty" is attainable no matter what mood or how unsure you are.    The good writer is the one who sat there night after night writing shitty words until he got less shitty,  not the one who sat there waiting for inspiration to strike and the words to just come out perfectly.  

Anyways,  those analogies helped me :)

 The strange thing is, too much bold. They are like gravity wells pulling me in. I have a hard time reading the normal font in between. So I could only glance.

Bold should be used sparsely. Don't mean to be a prick here. Just sharing based on the initial comments made about the format.

 I like your post, except for one bit: the “normie” thing. 

Believing that one is “abnormal” can be alienating and lead to worsening of depression or anxiety, as well as contribute to the aimlessness we work so hard to overcome. True, our brains function differently than the “average” human’s, but I had a therapist who used to say, “Normal is for forces and data distributions, not for people.” 

In addition, from an evolutionary standpoint, ADHD is an advantage. This statement is supported by two main theories, which I call the Percy Jackson theory and the efficiency theory. If you’ve ever read Percy Jackson (if you haven’t, you absolutely should), you’ll remember that the demigods all have ADHD, because in the battlefield, it helped them survive because they could split their attention in multiple different ways. 

We take stimulants for ADHD because ADHD is actually caused by an underactive brain (I know, weird). An ADHD brain does not expend as much energy as a neurotypical brain, which evolutionarily makes it more efficient. In a roundabout way, ADHD brains have just evolved more. 

So moral of the story, yeah, I guess you’re not a “normie” because no one is. But there’s nothing “wrong”, your brain just works differently. I say this not as a contradiction but because I’ve learned this paradigm shift to help myself feel less “different”, less alienated, which keeps me less anxious and less depressed.  Another paradox: I'm highly introverted. However, I do my best work when I'm around people. Recently, I have come to the conclusion that I feel the need to prove myself when other people are around, therefore making me work harder. 

As it's my first year out of public school, and I have yet to transfer to a uni from my local community college, I'm still living at home and not around people. Beforehand, I did cross country, track, and swim. I was always around people and I felt I needed to prove myself to them. My favorite thing about the ADHD subreddit is that I can head to it, read a random post, and basically say "yup thats me." It shows im not alone. Thanks for your nice comment :) I'm not sure I understand what a GTD process is but I'm glad my post made you feel understood. So are there three me now? Lol, went undiagnosed for a very long time because my Mom is the textbook definition of ADD and always thought it was normal behavior. Oh gosh. I so relate to this XD a daily conversation with my mother.  When I make a todo list, I forget to look at it... To give you a little background, I had to upload a paper today but I had no motivation for the entire week. Today, instead of panicking and feeling bad I tried to think about why things work as they do. I remembered a comment I saved and started writing my own experiences. It ended up here. Without my brain being a little child like you said, I would have never posted. Good day to you, try to get out of that room if you can. To do lists, or really just lists in general, have a slightly different place in my life.  If my brain is overwhelmingly filled with house projects and hiking trips I want to plan with my friends and a hundred other things when all I want to do is fall asleep or focus on work for my job, I will sometimes write down a list of those things that aren't relevant to the task at hand as a way to maybe stop thinking about them. I believe I try to keep thinking of those things out of fear of forgetting that I wanted to do those things, even though I know that more than likely my environment will remind me of those issues again anyway. And that is what keeps me awake instead of getting some much needed sleep.



But it does me no good to be thinking about how/when I am going to fix my cracked and leaking chimney at midnight on a Tuesday night...am I going to fix it right now? Nope. Can it wait for the weekend? Yep. Cool, I'll write it down and maybe (probably) forget about it until I stumble across my list again or next time I see the water stains on the exposed brick in my living room. It's not a perfect system, but usually the things that require immediate attention, have a way of expressing their urgency to be addressed.

Holy ADHD Rants

**tl;dr:**  If thoughts swirling around in my head aren't relevant to the task at hand, I write them down to "Empty my brain" of the stuff that is stressing me out, but I can't address that specific problem right now anyway, so get it outta there! I find planners useless. They are a panic attack waiting to happen. 

One really insightful thing I had explained to me once is the negative impulse. Not an impulse to do something, but an impulse to NOT do something. Putting more pressure on yourself is just putting more pressure on the brakes. It is my most intractable symptom.

To fight it, i have several workarounds. I hope maybe some of these might help you. 

I enlist helpers for the big, important things. I tell the helper what my deadline is and ask them to help me stay on track. They’ll call and ask for an update, including where I am and what I have left. It’s amazing how much it helps when I give myself the illusion of a collaborator, even though I am the one who set it up. My husband and coworkers have been really great about it. 

I also set up some rules for myself for smaller tasks, like I can’t do X until I have accomplished Y. X is something my impulses want to do, like look at Reddit. I’m putting completing a negative impulse task as an obstacle to getting to my reward impulse. It really helps with the motivation. 

I’ll set a timer for myself so I only have to work on it for 15 minutes, because I can do anything for 15 minutes. Often by the time the timer goes off, I’m in the flow of getting it done. If not, I got 15 minutes of work done.

I also set reminders in my phone that it is time to start something. I don’t see it lurking, it just pops up. I’m much better at tasks that pop up suddenly than I am at tasks that loom on a calendar page, because it’s like a dog chasing a squirrel. 

Don’t be so hard on yourself; that’s another symptom of ADHD. You are probably creative and productive once you get going, and you obviously want to succeed. The planner path isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay. Keep trying new paths until you find what works for you. 
 ikr To be honest I fail to find my words to answer in a non-awkward way, but you appear to be really well organised. It must be though to find people that are like you.

Thanks for sharing all the references and for sharing about your life, I'm definitely going to save your post.

To be honest, and you don't have to answer, I can't really imagine how someone with both autism and adhd would act... I mean like, do they just coexist or are there strange crossover stuff that neither just adhd'ers or people 'just' with autism have to deal with?

I can only imagine if I was required to organise myself strictly every step of the way just to feel at ease, with my terrible organisational skills while forgetting at least one step of my routine on the way... I mean, to me it sounds really hard, is it accurate or do I have a bad understanding of autism?

Anyway, thanks for your comment! I'll try to remember to have a look at your suggestions tomorrow, if I don't forget. I like this term "updoots" Your comment is very relatable, how many times do you think I've been able to "redirect my energy" to something good like working out while nearly hating myself for my blatant acts of self-sabotage?

Well, not very often I can tell you that.  
Thanks for sharing :). Yeah, little typo. Thx  > typo's

I type that. I don't connect that well to my peers. Luckily I've learned some public speaking and I have a girlfriend for quite a while now, both great confidence boosters with helps in not being awkward in group.

To be honest, it's something I'm still quite bad at. I've recently joined a kind of club that's all about thinks that interest me. I've noticed there is a smaller barrier to talking to people in those environments. Good luck with finishing that task :) You can save a post by clicking on the bookmark symbol in the top right corner on mobile. That's all I know.

You know these kind of comments is the best thing to happen to me this week :) glad I could help you out. Alright, I'll try to hit more of an optimal amount in the next adhd post, should I ever post a follow up or something. I understand what you say, but what I really meant is that it's no fun if people tell me they understand me because they have similar problems ("everybody forgets"). Not because it's a bad thing to say, but it implies they don't acknowledge that it's a real problem for me since it's not a big deal for them.

I'm saying it's not inherently wrong that a neurotypical person tells me that I shouldn't be as troubled as I would be if I forget something. It just makes me feel bad because the psychological harm the constant forgetfulness affects me a lot while that person seems barely be affected by it. For them it seems to be no more than an inconvenience.

It's a bit like telling someone with three fingers you understand it's annoying if you drop something but you know, it's not that bad if you do. There is nothing wrong with saying that, but the three-fingered person might interpret it as if you don't see the problem in dropping things while he struggled with that his whole life, making him feel bad.

Anyway, I'll definitely have a look a your theories. Thanks for the contribution. [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) - don't go too far down that rabbit hole, but the "process" has some good processes, as long as you adjust to make them useful for you.

I need lots of alarms and timers in order to remember anything. I also forget to look at todo lists, which makes them hard for me to use.

The best thing I think that can be done is to use an app that acts more like a todo list with an alarm (with snooze). i.e. Every 15th, Pay the Bills. Every 1st, Change Air Filter. I get a chime every 5 minutes unless if I snooze it (i.e. remind me in an hour, or remind me tomorrow).

Eventually, I plan to build an app called NagBot that does the same thing, but is a little more assertive. - When I get around to it... I’m experiencing this right now! I was officially diagnosed last year, but am now realizing that my mom has raging ADHD as well. I always compared myself to her and thought, huh, guess I must be normal... now I see all the ADHD behaviors in her too and can’t believe neither of us never knew lol No need to now, you wrote down those tasks you so you don't have to keep track of things like "look at the list" any more! This really clicked for me. Thank you so much!! Thank you so much. I’m really grateful for this advice. I’m really committed to managing things better than the current system which is not working well enough to feel rewarding.  I don’t think it’s tough to find people like me at all! I think I just have a very good skill for solving problems. I am a mathematician, after all. 

ADHD and autism coexisting is very common actually! I have what would be called Aspergers, though that’s not a diagnostic term any more. I have sensory issues, I’m not great socially (but I’m a woman and so it’s infinitely easier on me- people naturally don’t find me creepy. A sad truth, and not intended to be sexist in any way). I’m very confused by a lot of things socially, but it’s never been a huge issue. I just have to teach people how to communicate with me and after they learn, things go very smoothly. Overall ADHD for me is way worse than autism, though I don’t have autism very severely. 

I’m actually not really that organised! I just have solid systems in place that I built very slowly by forming habits. 30/30 is amazing for me and really is the reason I can be so seemingly organised. I also use a bullet journal (a very minimalist one at that) and that’s incredible for me. I’m more organised than the average person probably, but it’s not stressful or difficult to achieve. 

I think a lot of it is just.. minimalism. My life is exceedingly simple. I work, pay bills, cook, clean, study, and have fun. I don’t have much stuff, and everything I do own is my favourite thing. It’s hard to find life to be chaotic when there’s just not enough things for it to even *be* chaotic. 

I think a problem with ADHD is our inability to really properly prioritise. I’d always put way too much on my plate and inevitably fail. I always have to ask myself ‘is this really necessary?’. For example a reading goal: do I *really* need to read one book a week? No, I don’t. I really don’t and it’ll just cause me more stress if I try to do that. I try to keep my life as simple as I can, because then it gives me the freedom to pick my own challenges instead of constantly struggling with life. It turns out that a lot of what we make ourselves do is just unnecessary. 

Also one last thing- passion. Passion is the most important trait anyone can have. I’m passionate about myself, I’m passionate about life. I only do things I’m passionate about. I work a job that I love, I study a degree that I adore, I live in an apartment that is so beautiful (and cheap!) that it takes my breath away every time I look around. I surround myself with things I love, and so I find it so difficult to be discouraged. I highly recommend minimalism to any ADHDer - it’s been a life changer. The minimalism documentary on Netflix is a great place to start to find out about it. 

I wouldn’t worry about coming across as awkward- everyone does sometimes! And you’re on an ADHD sub, we’re all like this😂 https://i.imgur.com/U9Tuqmx.jpg Aww, I liked that typo though. Felt meaningful.  I’m glad you were able to give this advice. My dad called me lazy and what not for not being able to plan ahead and not be bothered to do work, even when I try to explain my side he just claims I’m lying to myself and to him.

Also, just saved it so I can look back to it whenever we get into our occasional arguments about problems relating to my ADHD.

You also have no idea how much this is helping me :) I’ll have to use this advice with future endavours  I think you should, you are obviously a thinker and reflective by nature. And the world needs more thought and a whole lot less action.

 I see, okay. So your issue is when neurotypical people make light of the fact that you forgot something, not realizing that it’s not the forgetting the thing,  it’s the compounded effect of forgetting A LOT of things all the time.  Thanks :) I will definitely read that this evening.

Also, if you need a tester for when your first versions are finished you can sign me up. I can't recommend [alarmed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alarmed-reminders-timers/id371886784?mt=8) highly enough, it basically does what you describe, and is super customizable with recurrences and snoozing and stuff. Some upfront time commitment to learn it, but totally worth it.

>Eventually, I plan to build an app

Me too my friend, me too. no problem! happy to pass on some of the helpful things I've learned in my struggles.  Another ridiculously long, War and Peace-length response but I have SO MANY THOUGHTS and would love to prevent someone else from the years of misery I went through trying to work the way everyone else does: 

My favorite movie quote is from The Iron Giant: “You are who you choose to be.” It took me years to realize I was choosing to be the person who was terrible at time management, and treating my successes like accidents I didn’t deserve and my failures as just punishment. Life got much better when I chose to embrace being the person with hyperfocus, creativity, and crisis management skills. All ADHD traits that I wouldn’t trade for anything; they are at the core of who I am.

Looking around and realizing what isn’t working for you is a great first step. The next one is crucial: identifying areas and situations where you DO thrive. What do they have in common? What can be transferred to other areas? That’s the way to build a foundation for success on your terms. 

I found it so freeing to finally accept that the types of organization that work for most people are recipes for failure for me. But then I realized I am really good at handling emergencies, turning on a dime, and coming up with creative solutions on short notice — these are all the sort of instant reaction, anti-time-management strengths that everyone needs from time to time, and ADHD traits can be stellar in that setting. 

People often talk about organization as a virtue, but you can promote your flexibility as a virtue as well. And be vocal about it, because the organization-focused don’t always realize that instant responsiveness is a useful skill. They often come to appreciate it when it is pointed out to them, and in fact we often work well together because we complement each other’s strengths. 

I have learned to explain to potential employers that I am who they want in creative and crisis management roles, but that I am a poor fit in budgeting or planning roles of any kind. Not only does it save everyone from future disappointment, but I know I am regarded as valuable for what I bring to the table. It was a huge relief to stop trying to hide my struggles with time management from my co-workers and instead speak frankly to them about it, because my problem could turn into their problem down the line. Acknowledging it openly helps others understand how to work with you (and there’s almost always at least one super-organized person in the office who will be delighted to help with this task). We generally find a balance without me ever having to go into panic mode.

I encourage you to accept that your weaknesses are not character flaws. You didn’t sign up for them, and you are not lazy. They are part of a complex neurological system that comes with some pluses and some minuses; time management and self-starting happen to be some of the minuses. Kicking yourself over it is counter-productive. A better, less emotional approach is to acknowledge that it is an obstacle you just need work around, and not waste energy trying to eradicate. Find a way to detour around it rather than waste energy trying to dynamite it out of existence. 

Most important, do whatever it takes to convince yourself that just because your strengths are not standard, it does not mean they are not valuable. They are absolutely strengths, and they are yours. Be proud of them, work with them, and do your best to highlight those instead. It will make all the difference.

Best of luck and keep us posted! 


 Yeah, but I like to iam for that sweet sweet karma I heard so much about. I can't really do that with a text filled with typo's now can I? Yeah I's a bit like that. I know it's a bit contradictory to state "I don't like being different." In one line and "I don't like being called normal." in the next, but that was the reason I called the post 'how I deal with paradoxes of adhd.'. It's really the emotional effects those situations have had on me and my coping strategies now.

I admit this wasn't always clear in the text tough (the last part mainly), because I hoped others could give their experiences where mine fell short and because I started getting distracted.

I think I'll try to post a better version eventually, thanks for showing me a poorly worded part of the text.
