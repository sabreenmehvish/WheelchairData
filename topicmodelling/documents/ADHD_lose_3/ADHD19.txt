I feel like I can't do anything without my Ritalin, and it's not helping as much anymore Before I started Ritalin I was just average to below-average grades, average abilities and thinking, etc. I had missing work ALL THE TIME because I'd forget, lose assignments, or just not be motivated to do anything. When I started taking Ritalin, I started getting all As, participating in class, and being productive. That first year I took it, I felt a high/rush, and a strange sensation in my body after I took the medicine. Then I'd be more "awake" and alert and be a working machine. 
Two years later, I don't feel the effects nearly as strongly. I'm starting to miss assignments again, I don’t have nearly as much motivation to work, and I'm more anxious. Maybe I need to up my dose? I can’t take a break from it because I have so much missing work pilling up. I tried to take a break from my pills this weekend, but now I can’t focus on any of my missing work. I can’t even do my hobbies anymore, like video games. I tried playing a game yesterday, and my reactions are so slow! I can’t even sit still and focus enough to play my piano anymore, and I’m stumbling on songs I’ve known for years.
 I feel like a complete idiot off my meds, but I was at least partially functional off them before I started. Now when I’m off them, it’s like I can’t function, period. My on-meds self has become my partially functional pre-Ritalin self. Now my off meds post-Ritalin self can’t do anything at all. I feel jumbled and slow and stupid just trying to write this right now. I don’t know if I’m even making sense. 
Do I just need to take more every day? I don’t know what else I can do, and I’m getting desperate given how backed up I am on work. I’m struggling.
