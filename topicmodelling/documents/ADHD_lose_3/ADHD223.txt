I finally booked a GP appointment after 6 years of procrastination Today I bit the bullet and booked an appointment for the end of this month. Alas, I have spent the past 6 years desperate to find out if something is wrong with me that can actually be helped at least slightly. Instead of seeing anyone, I just ploughed on and told myself I'm probably just a teenager going through teenage things and not trying hard enough. Now I am 22 and frustrated with how hard I find almost every aspect of life, but mainly academia.

I'm quite worried that the GP will not believe that ADHD is even a thing and will just think of me as a lazy student trying to get a fix to study hard. I honestly can't study at all, this is why I can't force myself into being motivated anymore. I'm going to list things and yada yada but I'm just concerned. Is there anything to be concerned about? What if she doesn't want to refer me?

Oh and lastly, how much should I mention about recreational drugs, if anything? I know sometimes it's mentioned as evidence of a lack of impulse control, but I have dabbled with numerous substances and don't want her to think I'm just there to get drugs.

TLDR: Anything to be worried about with the first GP appointment?  1. Youâ€™ll probably be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist.

2. Thereâ€™s a small chance you might also be given some medication, like Strattera or Wellbutrin, right of the bat (depends on the GP).

3. Donâ€™t bring up and past recreational drug use whatsoever. Stimulant medication is Schedule II and is highly abusable. 

Really, just be honest with you doctor about how youâ€™re feeling. Itâ€™s not good to lie to a doctor and then get caught in that lie. When I first went to my GP, he seemed skeptical, even somewhat dismissive of me, but he gave me some questionnaires and then referred me to a specialist clinic, at which I have my full assessment later this month.

* Show up with any referral forms if you want a referral to specific specialists or clinics; for example, there was one adult ADHD clinic in my city, so obviously I wanted to go there.
* Write down a list of symptoms; explain how they *impair your activities of daily living and/or cause distress* (e.g., warnings at work/fired, poor marks, lost relationships, conflict in relationships, forgetfulness, missed deadlines, stress, etc.). Make it clear that this isn't just about you wanting to focus a little more and bring up your marks.
* Explain what you've done to try and fix this. The first things my GP asked when I mentioned ADHD were about sleep, diet, drugs, and exercise. He even asked if I meditate! I do all of those things, but the distress remains.
* Bring someone for support and to corroborate your symptoms; I brought my partner, but you could bring a sibling or parent. It really helped when she said she was concerned with my mental health and explained *how my behavior affected her.* I'm in the same boat as you except I haven't actually made an appointment. I don't even have a GP so I gotta find one first. Set 3 different with the same doctor and never showed up. Getting a diagnosis is something I've been meaning to do this year, but I'm more worried about not having ADHD at this point. I really don't want to go through the entire process just to find out that I really am just a lazy piece of shit. Good job! My mom has adhd and my dad may not but is similarly time-challenged, so never finishing or even getting around to things seemed kind of normal to me, so I didn't fully realize until my ADHD journey that having "absolutely top priority" things sit on a to-do list for literally years was apparently not typical for everyone!
 In my experience it's best to be 100% open and honest about prior/current drug use, and that includes smokes/booze, not just illicit drugs.  GP's are smart enough to know when they're being lied to, and if they know anything about adhd, they'll recognise habitual use as self-medication.  If they don't, find a better GP. Best to get a referral to a psychiatrist though and open up to them, if possible.   Cheers. Thank you! Yep I was thinking not to mention drugs unless maybe vaguely if they asked Thank you very much!  Yep I am honestly doubting myself and thinking that I'm probably just making excuses or that I'm just a typical student. Then I compare myself to other students and realise that I definitely need help It's wild right! Plus it's also sad because I've missed out on many opportunities because of it. I was going to apply for a summer internship for the summer just gone. When I first looked ay applying, the applications hadn't opened yet. I made a top priority note to apply soon. When I looked again, the application deadline had passed. Seriously like several months had passed without me even realising!  Also yeah, my dad is similarly time-challenged. It took him a decade to get his PhD (granted he had a family and a job) and a decade to get our extension done on the back of the house. ðŸ¤”  Thank you :)  Everyone forgets about things but I think it's hard for non-adhd people to understand how someone can forget about things that are sincerely important to a person. But we can do it! :/

For me with these things I tend to remember them at inopportune times when I can't deal with them. But then I genuinely do forget about them in the moment! And so goes the cycle! With some avoidance thrown in for the more daunting things, of course.  Haha well I'm in good company then as I work full-time but am trying to finish a dissertation that is now about 3 years later than planned! Yes exactly, I remember things somewhat often but it's always when I can't immediately deal with it. Then because I can't do it there and then, I completely forget...until I next remember it ðŸ¤” Ah yeah and definitely the avoidance!  Good luck!!  Thank you!
