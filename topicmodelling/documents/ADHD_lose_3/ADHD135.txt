Keep your pills in this box and sends an alarm to your phone if you forget to take them https://pillbox.tinylogics.com/collections/all-product/products/memo-box-mini

Im kind of sad that this product already exists because I thought I had a great kickstarter idea...but here it is haha. Been around since 2014. 

So if any of you tend to forget your pills, this might be a good option. It's about $30. You can use their App to set up the pill box to trigger an alarm if you havent taken your pills by a certain time. 

Theres bigger versions too on other parts of the site and other manufactures have similar products called a smart safe--same reminder capabilities but if you want to be able to lock your pills in a safe, it might be a good option for you (costs >$100 though) Thanks for the link, I forget all the time They had me at "free shipping". Now, to find something that reminds me to put the pills in this thing... No problem
