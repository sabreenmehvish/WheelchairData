I finally emailed financial aid!! Yay me!!!! Iâ€™ve been putting it off and forgetting about it since September!!! I woke up this morning and finally remembered to do it. I am so proud of myself. A little victory to kick off my Tuesday. Oh man, thanks for reminding me ðŸ˜‚ Thank you, your post reminded me to pay my bills! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congrats on getting something accomplished youâ€™ve been putting off!! I wish I had some of the same motivation... lol. Good for you.  Congratulations!!! Keep it up. A big thing for me to remember things is to put a post it note with essential todos(emphasis on essential) on my phone. I put it under my case slightly so I have to lift it a bit and then pull it out. The note with my small list of 1-3 items that I have to do today is the first thing I read/see when I turn my alarm off. Well shit, I still haven't done it Congrats!, i struggled for a while remmembering to apply for DSA (disability student) in uk. Yay good job!!  Yeeees!! Seriously well done Never related more to a post in my lifeðŸ˜‚ Can I suggest you guys to use a note-keeping app? 

I also suffer from this forgetfulness, and using a note-keeping app made my mind a bit more clear since it handles the *remembering* part for me. I can even set reminders to schedule things.

I use Google Keep, but I have heard that OneNote is good as well. Some people are also using Evernote, which I don't know much about. I say try them all and decide which one works for you the best.

Sidenote: I still forget things on a regular basis. I sometimes even forget to note things down. So this is not a silver bullet, but I feel like it is better than nothing, especially for appointment stuff and note keeping.

Edit: Also, an auto-sync digital calender has been very useful for me. I set up all my devices to automatically sync with my google calendar. I suggest you try to do this as well. Nice. It's the little victories. Aaaaand my car's two months late. Good thing I have the money to pay it.  Go do something right now ;) Thatâ€™s an interesting idea to put it slightly under your case! I write things down all the time and constantly lose my notes lol Thanks for your input, Iâ€™ll definitely check those apps out!  Same hahaha except donâ€™t have the money so that makes putting off bills even worse.  I think I will! :)  I hope they will work out for you.
