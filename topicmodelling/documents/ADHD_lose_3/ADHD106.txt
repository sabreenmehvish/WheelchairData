People who manage their ADHD without meds, what’s your routine? What are your challenges? I might have to give up or reduce meds because of a health issue. I don’t wanna, but there it is. :( 

Those who aren’t medicated, what routines and habits work for you in terms of nutrition, exercise, meditation, organization, etc? Did you get help from a therapist? Did you do it by yourself? Fill me in! I don’t wanna lose my ability to adult... Hi! I'm a college student who can't be on meds because I also have an anxiety disorder and any kind of stimulant-- caffeine included-- gives me panic attacks. 

Not gonna lie and say my system is perfect, but I haven't flunked out of school yet, so. I do have a great therapist. A lot of my coping strategies have to do with my memory; the SECOND I discover something that I need to get done I make a note of it on my phone. (I use my phone and not paper because I tend to lose pieces of paper.) I set lots of alarms for things too. My attention issues are...less well-managed, but through trial and error I've learned a lot about what environments I work better in than others. I tend to take lots of breaks from work, often with a timer so I don't forget to go back to it. I still have a lot of trouble paying attention to assignments that don't interest me but as long as I block out enough time to work in I get things done eventually. (If I think something will take me an hour I give myself two or three.)

My slow cooker is a lifesaver, it's way easier for me to remember to put food in it right after I get up in the morning than it is for me to stop whatever I'm doing in the evening to make dinner. 

I weave little keychain things in class because it doesn't make any noise and I can just do it with my hands without distracting anyone. Having something like that to work on helps me sit still,

I will probably remember something else interesting to say in half an hour. I went without meds until this year, I'm 25. I use them now for behavioral reasons. Before that, I had a number of things I did to keep my life in line.

- Everything in my home has a place, and they always go back if place something down with purpose. This is most important for my wallet and keys
- My wallet and keys have bluetooth trackers and my phone records the last known GPS location upon disconnection
- I attempt to get up and go to bed at the same time every day ±1 hour
- Any important mail I get goes into an inbox to be handled when I have time or remember
- After being handled, important papers go into a to be filed box
- Eventually, papers are filed into labeled hanging folders (banking, taxes, paid bills, home, job, health ...)
- All important dates and appointments are put into my iCloud calendar immediately as I'm made aware of them and synced to all my devices. Reminders are set for the day before and 30 minutes before. If it's more than a month away, I set a week reminder as well
- Anything worth remembering is worth writing down
- Important tasks that are fast are done as soon as I remember to do them. (e.g. paying credit card bills. Pull out my phone. Use app. Done)
- All fixed cost monthly bills are set to auto pay (cell, internet...)
- Credit cards are set to auto pay minimum. I always intend to pay off in full, but if I forget, this way I only pay interest and don't get a credit score hit
- When I can't bothered to eat healthy, I eat/drink [soylent](https://www.soylent.com).


The one bill I don't have setup to autopay is the electricity. I kid you not, more than once I've called to ask why my bill has doubled only to be told I didn't pay last month. If I stray from my routine, everything goes to shit, starting with forgetting to put on my shoes and not realizing until I notice that the sidewalk feels funny.


Edit: Forget this one. All my finance accounts are connected to mint for budgeting. Organisation: Action day diary (like a bullet journal but easier to stick to and it helps breaks things down), or outlook calendar to plan and organise tasks, and fitbit for silent alarms to remind me to do things. Try and keep your daily activities at the same time everyday (I can send you a photo of my schedule later if you want :))


Exercise: To get rid of excess energy I do the same thing, to build energy I do multiple things. But mostly it's just regular walks to refresh myself during the day


Nutrition: Regular meals that don't include foods that make me tired (foods that drain your energy are probably different to mine so I won't list them). I wouldn't suggest cutting out sugar, just avoid sugar from unhealthy food and replace it. I find porridge is good for breakfast.


Mindfulness: Stop tasks - to think through something before you do it. Not sure what this one's called, but when you notice you're not doing what you're meant to bring yourself back to the present and essentially you just keep repeating it and it gets a lot easier to do.


Apps/Extensions: Forest! I try to compete with myself to see how much I can get done in each 25 minute interval, and the app stops you from using your phone by killing your tree :( (The app is $2, the chrome extension is free)


Self-care: Try to get into a good sleep routine, I find camomile tea is helpful for sleeping and calming down when anxious. Showering helps with general mood. Keeping my environment tidy helps with overwhelm a lot (whenever my house is messy my head is messier than usual). Socialising and group sports help with work stress or when you need to escape from a lot of other stress tbh. Therapist to moan about my life and get things off my chest.


This is what helped me as a kid and I use as an adult when I'm off meds






TL;DR: A planner that works for you, silent alarms, regular walks, eat foods that don't make you feel crap, mindfulness, Forest, sleep, showering, keeping your house clean Post college here, been working an office job for a few years now. Most of what I find works has already been listed here, but I’ll add what I can.

Most of it, I find, is knowing your weaknesses and doing what you can to keep yourself honest. Working with or even around other people did a lot to keep me on task, rather than trying to sequester myself in my room (and inevitably fall into the Internet hole or spin in my chair for hours). In a professional environment working in an open office layout serves the same purpose. If I had an office to myself I really doubt I’d be as productive.

Keep your tasks as visible and quantifiable as possible. Calendar alerts are a godsend, but double up as much as possible. Besides phone alerts, I have a physical calendar, a meeting notebook, and a ton of sticky notes all over my desk. Once there’s something that I have to do, even if I can do it right now, I write it down somewhere and physically cross it off when I’m done. The act of writing it helps me remember, and crossing it off is satisfying enough to keep me on top of it. And even if you can’t record everything everywhere, as long as it gets added somewhere you keep your bases covered. And being able to look at a list of your accomplishments, even small ones, is good for moral.

I think the biggest thing is just accepting the “rules of the game” as I like to call them and just building your life around them. I know that long meetings make me scream internally and I start getting worked up after a while, so I make sure to book time before and after to chill and organize so that it doesn’t seem so daunting and it’s easier to stay attentive. I hate putting time into cooking, so I make big meals a few times a week that I can stretch out, and fill the rest with low effort meals like salads and nuts.

Meds made me miserable for years and messed with my health, but I’ve been going fine without them for about 6 years now. Mistakes are still made and there are certainly situations that I probably would have handled better if I had the ol’ chemical focus, but that’s just life. Not everything I do will work for everyone, of course, and everyone has their own approach, but it can definitely done and it isn’t the overwhelming task that some folks think it may be. Hope this helps somehow! Just got diagnosed this week. I'm 27. 

I've overread productivity hacks since graduating college. Over the years, here's how I've survived:

1) I self-medicated with coffee. Most days included a redeye in the morning and a large coffee after lunch. Occasionally another coffee in the afternoon too. So, I guess I've been medicated this whole time. I still suspect caffeine isn't as effective as what's typically prescribed. 

2) When things were tough, a low carb diet helped. If unable to commit to that, high protein / low carb lunches helped. 

3) Noise blocking headphones and some good low-fi electronic playlists. Helps me focus and get in the flow. 

4) To-Do lists. I like having two. One contains must dos in order of priority. And then a running list. 

5) Automating payments for bills, at least minimums. 

6) Learning about NLP and using some of those tips and tricks (anchors) to make myself aware of conciousness behavior (e.g. when procrastinating on a task). 

7) When procrastinating on a task, I break it down into it's smaller segments. Identify if any will give me issues. Then start (hopefully).

8) I use Evernote and I have notebooks organized in different areas. I keep my 5 minute journal here too which helps me keep track of priorities for the day, gratitude, and what I completed. I also store anything of importance here (thoughts, bookmarks, articles, etc). I tried a bullet journal but realized if my routine changed slightly or didn't have a backpack that it was difficult to stay on routine. 

9) Amazon impulsive book purchases. I set a 2fa verification text that goes to my wife. 

10) When I'm overwhelmed, I do meditate. Close my eyes, focus on breathing, let thoughts pass in and out. Try to get to the point after my ears tingle and have disconnected from senses. Stay there for about 5 minutes. This isn't always realistic. When I need to calm down quickly, in public; I'll do boxed breathing. 4 seconds inhale, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds exhale, 4 seconds hold. Repeat. 

----------------------------------------------------
Tips and tricks that have worked, but I don't consistently do:

1) Accountability partner. I was really behind at work at one point. My manager reviewed my tasks each day with me for a month. K caught up and got a better hold. 

2) Exercise. Long winter here. When it goes away, I'll go back to riding bikes. Will probably play tennis this year. Over winter I tried to do kettle bell swings and other in home work outs, but could not maintain consistency. 


Unsolved challenges:

1) Impulsive spending, especially for food. I'm a food snob and this is my favorite way to reward myself. I live in a city much more expensive than my hometown. It's easy to overspend in this area. Trying to cook more, meal prep, but I work a lot and can never half-ass a meal. 

2) Consistent adherence to system, including all of the items above. I think the most important thing here is to not get stuck in the thought loop of failure or a lost habit and to just keep trying. If you fall off, get back on. 

3) Organizing mail and not letting it pile up. I've started the one touch rule for email where you sort it or take action immediately. I need to create a similar system for physical mail.  Glad to answer this question! I hope some day I can organize my thoughts enough to make a post about it, but for now I'll try to summarize the important points.

First, I have no formal diagnosis yet, just 26 years of not understanding the world until I discovered ADHD and it all made sense.


Since then (about 6-8 months ago) I have been doing therapy once a week, trying to be organized and switching bad habits for good ones. Still fighting depression and anxiety. Had a lot of progress against social anxiety, tho.

My current strategy is something along the lines of:

* Writing a journal. This has proven to be immensely positive.
* Seeing a therapist once a week
* Trying not to be judgmental, both about me, others and the world
* Trying to accept that most things in life take time
* Having a notebook (for the first time in life) with me all the time (actually in my phone, through the Trello app and the Kanban technique)
* Taking notes about important stuff
* Scheduling important dates and events
* Trying to always have at least 5 "important things" to do every day
* Trying to do at least 1 or 2 of those things every day
* Generally developing discipline (didn't even value that as a desirable trait until discovering about ADHD)
* Planning things ahead, and sticking to the plan
* Forcing myself to have 8h of sleep everyday
* This involves always going to bed at the same time, having f.lux on, avoiding screens, etc
* Also always wake up the same time
* Always get out of bed immediately after waking up
* Having a morning routine helps with this:
  * Wake up
  * Make bed
  * Take meds (vitamins, etc)
  * Drink water
  * Take a shower
  * Make coffee, have coffee
  * Meditate (still working on it, tho - can only get 6 mins of mind wandering and checking the timer)
  * Go to work
* Trying to exercise (I've been on and off for moths now, for various reasons, but I won't give up!)
* Dealing with social anxiety:
  * Being more social
  * More open to different people
  * Saying good morning, see you later, etc
  * "Faking" attention: looking in the eye, nodding, etc. (but really trying - and it helps!)
  * Going to stuff I wouldn't usually go to (like I'm starting to play soccer with my colleagues once a week and it's been awesome! it helps immensely with my depression and anxiety)
  * Trying to develop a genuine interest in other people, whoever they might be
* Reading
* Brushing my teeth everyday
* Taking a 20 mins nap during lunch at work (been doing for 2 months already, only managed to have 3 mins of sleep, but it still helps! and i'm not giving up!)
* Cutting on weed (went from a toking right after waking up, to daily smoker, to only smoking before bed, and now I'm 4 days clean - yay!)
* Cutting on alcohol (a week clean - yay!)
* Stopping with porn and masturbation completely
* Generally going on the direction of a "healthy" life

Phew! I'm sure I forgot something, but also didn't want to write a wall of text. If you have any interest in anything listed, please ask and I could go on details.

EDIT: I forgot the most important one: trying not to be judgmental

EDIT 2: Added more stuff

EDIT 3: Ok, I'll leave it as it is now

EDIT 4: Making sketches of ideas and coming back to them later, revising them and so on

EDIT 5: No, really, this was the last one I'm following this, hope you get some advice! I posted something similar on here recently but didn't get much feedback.  1. Sleep is priority one. I have to get as much as I can. Seriously, nothing gets in the way of sleep for me, but I have a little child so I truly understand the value of sleep. 
2. Exercise at least 3-4 times a week. I like to lift heavy weights and dance. 
3. Habits and routines. I have a very unpredictable life so creating a predictable routine each day is hard, so I create mini routines around the most repeated and important things I do each day. I make a list of steps for a routine and I post it on a wall where it needs to happen. I follow the routine step by step and refine it. At a certain point it goes into what I call my "back brain", which doesn't get impacted by ADHD and I can remember it without accessing my executive functioning or short term memory. 
4. External scaffolding. These are all the external systems I use to fill in the gaps of the habits and routines above. I obsessively use my calendar and reminders. I use Google keep to keep track of lists. I put all my bills on auto-pay. I have systems for gift buying and replying to emails & texts. I wear a wristwatch so I know what the time is. I have a housekeeper. 
5. I keep my hands busy. I crochet or I use a fidget spinner. 
6. I know my weaknesses. I know I am terrible in large groups so I avoid them. I know I have a longer learning curve than most so I have to persevere when learning something.
7. I try to not be surprised or anxious when I inevitably fuck up. It shouldn't be a surprise at this point, and I can't do anything about it, it's just the brain I have been given to deal with and that's that. Better an ADHD brain than no brain at all. 

My challenge is procrastination and not being great in social situations. I have kinda come to accept these as inevitable in my unmedicated state. I've yet to find a really good workaraound. But at least I don't lose my keys every second day now.  My partner wasn't on meds for a long time and still hasn't quite found the right doses. 
But what's helped him the most is talking about things and asking the people in hisnlife for help. 
For example he takes on occasionalnjobs at a local race track, nothing major just litter picking (he's usually unemployed because he has anger problems) but he does it with a friend. Who'll ring him, goes to work with him, they don't do the same job but if needs be he's on hand and it just gives that little extra sense of security. 

As well as that he's trying to do things on his own. When he's had his meds he's built himself a routine and now he's sticking to it. He's in the habit of setting timers for things like cooking and has alarms that remind him to eat if he hasn't already. We covered his fridge in some chalkboard stuff and he writes things on that to remember them.  I'm not on meds bc I have anxiety and also I'm pregnant. I've never been on meds so I've got a pretty good system down by this point. 

Before my smart phone my arms and hands were covered in reminders. Now I put literally everything in my phone. Even things like "make dentist appointment" because it'll take me 3months to make the phone call. 

At work my desk is covered in large post it notes with everything I have to do on it. Every so often I consolidate when I've crossed a lot of stuff off. 

I seem to always forget at least one thing in the morning. I used to miss the bus in college a lot because I'd have to run back to my apartment and grab my book or coffee or whatever. Now i try to keep two of everything at work or in my car. I'm constantly forgetting to put deodorant on, take lunch with me etc. So I have food in my desk, deodorant in my center console etc. 

I also just let myself do what I feel like I need to do to pay attention. For example, I like sewing. But my ADHD makes it so that I skip directions or I forget them. Or I have to do something tedious like rip a seam which makes me feel anxious because I want to just rip it apart and I can't. So I pace when I do that stuff because it helps me focus.  The key to surviving and keeping things manable for me is thinking in terms of systems. A routine is often a part of my system for things. I write these systems down frequently. I have a bullet journal I keep by the couch, white boards around the house, and a little notebook I carry with me at all times when I leave the house. The more systems I hash put and stick to the easier my life gets, and the practice of physically writing and refining them keeps me from forgetting about them, which is one of the biggest challenges for me.  I am currently nursing my newborn, and have been with out meds since I found out I was pregnant. The beginning was difficult, but with help from my husband I got on a good schedule. I use my reminders on my phone for Anything  to remember or due. Sticky notes are also very helpful. I also make sure to put my keys and important stuff in the same drawer every day.  I think that talking with family and friends and having a good support group is very important, along with a day to day schedule and routine.  I'm eighteen and not medicated. I have a "to do" book. It's a cute little organized notebook from the dollar store. Its always on me (at my desk, bedside table, purse) and I forced the habit of writing *everything* down. Random ideas, those thoughts that blip into your head and you think "I have to remember this" but you know damn well you won't. I write all that down and go back to it when I feel like I'm forgetting something. Its not always perfect but it helps. 

Another thing is I write down plans. For me I have a problem with getting from point A (messy room) to point B (clean room). So when I have a moment that I'm able to focus, I make a step by step chart of how to do it. Like this:

- clear the garbage from the desk
- put all the clothes from the floor into a bag 
- take the trash from the floor and put it in the bin
- put the correct items into the corresponding boxes

etc etc I'm sure you get it by now. I have to write down everything like what I'm going to have for breakfast/lunch/dinner to make sure I get enough nutrients. 

it's still incredibly difficult and even when I know what I need to do, it can be impossible to do it. (Currently writing this sitting on top of a pile of clothes that need to be put in the correct drawers but i can't get it done.) 
 48 and Unmedicated, so I have a lot of practice. 

First: I avoid being too hard on myself. 

Second: I’ve learned to forgive myself. 

Third: I’ve accepted that no matter how many lists, plans, or reminders I have, I’m still going to fuck up once in a while. 

Fourth: I surround myself with positive, supportive people who don’t give me a hard time about this condition that I cannot fully control. 

Fifth: I do the best I can to maintain enough schedule during the work week to keep my job and allow myself to freewheel on the weekends. Yep, that makes Monday difficult, but freewheeling makes me happy, and I deserve to be happy, so fuck it. 

Sixth: I have a job I love, so it’s easier to get out of bed most work day mornings. Having a job I love over a job that makes me tons of money but I hate is the better way for me to keep a job.  I'm 33 and work in healthcare. Due to health concerns I too limit my med intake. When I was 22, the health concern wasn't an issue, but 10 yrs into taking adderall, it's not the same. As I age I need my sleep, and even at 10mg, my mind doesnt rest. So I take it one day, once every two weeks. 
In between, I manage by exercising, and really trying to focus. I have a kid, so I dont want to dissapoint, so my child is my drive. Point is, find something that drives you, something you hold dear, and maybe it will help to cut back on the pill.  [deleted] I may be in this boat again soon do to moving and meeting new doctors. 

I often do weekends without if there is nothing pressing, even though my wife calls me out every single time, without me telling her. If she gets annoyed enough I’ll take that as I should probably take meds that day.

When I’ve gone stretch’s without, a mix of everything I do to help when on meds( lists , alarms, reminders) and a troublesome relationship with caffeine seemed to keep me from losing my job. But with that I still was having the rufflist time getting “from A to D” which is my short hand for when medication and coping skills work I go A,B,C,D. .i do the steps needed to accomplish something. When they don’t , I know A, I know D, but I have a lot trouble figuring out how to B,C.  I am more unmedicated than medicated.

For thought organization (and note-organization), I found the use of mind-maps very helpful. I have settled on using Freeplane, which is open source and free and has a good community behind it.

At first glance, the software looks really dated and ugly compared to others (X-Mind) and maybe a looks a bit too complex. It is complex if you want to use it to its full potential, but I find that even sticking to the basic ideas of mindmapping in Freeplane is a lot more helpful than say, using word or text documents.

In short, it's a tree structure in which where you can input information and collapse/unfold the branches (nodes). It's the same idea as a bullet point list, but the advantage is that the nodes can be moved around freely, and you can move around using the keyboard (arrows to move between nodes, insert for new nodes, etc.). Each node can house "notes" where I can type more detailed information. I can move and reorganize the nodes later in a more logical way if everything comes out jumbled at first.

I'm more of a "visual" person, so by using a mind-map, I know the location of certain information in relation to the center. You can use images and colors and other visual cues to help with the memorization, although I use that rarely.

The fact that I can collapse certain branches that are not relevant right now but I know they're not going anywhere (unlike a piece of paper or 5 different notebooks). 

It saved my ass during the first few months of a job that required to be very organized at a time where my anxiety was through the roof and my memory was shit.

Here are some videos which show the basics

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKt9Bm9krBM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hy69IB3Pak

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfGAuHJk0s I don't try to pretend that I have it all together, then I'd just feel worse about my shortcomings. I choose not to take my meds most of the time because I feel better accomplishing things without assistance.

Will power is a tough one for me, but I've figured out that if I just start moving towards my current objective, I can use the momentum to keep going. Like if I have to get up in the morning and I'm still tired I will roll out of bed and force myself to either land on my feet or hit my face on the ground. Once I'm up I use that momentum to start my day.

Taking breaks is something I do every 15-20 minutes or so. If I don't switch things up I become agitated and less effective. I've turned this negative into a positive and it has allowed me to work on multiple projects back and forth throughout the day. I usually take a 5-10 break each time. 

Pacing is everything. You need to find a pace that is comfortable for you to work at or you will never have an easy time without medication. I've fallen into the trap of thinking that if I'm not as fast as everyone else, I'm not as smart and I'm not as valuable. This is untrue, because it's not the speed of the work, but the work itself that matters.

Hope this helps a little  I managed to graduate from post secondary without medication, last time I took medication it gave me panic attacks which I hadn’t experienced ever prior to taking medication and I would say that general self awareness based off of methods for me that were tried and true was the best way for me to cope with the amount of stress I was under. I know that I work best under a little bit of pressure (doing things on a bit of a tight deadline, gave me more incentive to just get shit done instead of putting it off even further), I know that I work best independently as opposed to working as a team with other people (I get distracted easier when I’m around other people as opposed to being in my own little bubble), I know that I can’t work somewhere that’s pristine clean (my own personal preference), and I know that I’m the most productive when I’m a little bit stoned (easier for me to focus)  and listening to music (blocks out background noise). phone is a challenge for me, get stuck in social media, ive gotten a lot from doing greyscale.   Hahahaha "manage" hahahahhaha! Post college here - I spent 6 years at university with no degree whatsoever. That's how I discovered that ADHD might be the cause. I was always smart, intelligent kid who could do his homework at last minute, learn to exam night before and still get 4 or 5 (which is A or B in USA). Well, that didn't work at University, imagine.


The most important thing to me is running. I run 5 to 6 times a week from 3 to 7 kilometers every morning. Without morning exercises I feel very blunt and unstable.
That's how it works for me:

1. I get up early. Early for me means before 8 AM. Later than that I have worse mood and everything is difficult.

2. I write journal for 15 minutes. One of the greatest thing you can do for yourself is to write a journal. 15 minutes is just enough for me - not too long, not too short.

3. After that, I run. I try to listen to my body, sometimes I need more strain, sometimes less, but every time I'm going outside. Building routine is extremely important in the first weeks. Right now running is a almost effortless habit so I focus more on distance and technique. 

Remember, that you need at least one day rest from anything you do. So learn how to rest. It seems trivial, but ability to truly rest is something not everyone posses.



Apart from that:
- I eat in 16/8 method. 16 hours for fasting, 8 hours for eating. Great for one's attention span. Combined with yerba mate = focus. By the way, if meds or coffee are not working great try yerba mate. It's caffeine but works differently. 

- I don't eat sugar and don't drink alcohol. I tend to get extreme hangovers despite drinking tons of water. It's almost year right now - never felt better. And I was quite heavy drinker after high school.

- Pomodoro technique. I use Goodtime app. 15 minutes of work, 3 minutes break. After 4 session like this I give myself 10 minutes break. Those numbers works best for me. I'm able to focus on most boring tasks and if I do something I find interesting I can easily skip breaks and hyperfocus. 

- Write everything. Ideas, tasks, what you were doing, feelings, thoughts etc. Your working memory sucks, you need external data bank. Evernote app is great for this but old-shool-paper works wonders too.

- Find what's motivates you to work. E.g, I need to learn something new every time or I need someone to compete with. Competition makes me madman, especially if I can win.

- I need a team **badly**. Without everyday short meetings I would be lost for sure. 

- I dance a lot. I'm pretty sure dancing is great for people with adhd, because you are moving your body and communicate with others at the same time. And it's fun, very fun!

- Mechanical noises and A LOT OF spotify playlists. I need music and headphones. The most boring task with good music could be done fast and perfectly. But you have ADHD so listen to the same playlist is boring. So I have multiple playlists with different genres I like and if they do not work I listen to idle engine sound or 2-hours-train-in-the-rain YT video. I know it's weird but actually works. I rely on 3 prorities--1) I only do focused work after exercising: 1-2 hour walk every day. 2) bullet journal-- no electronic distractions, just pen and paper for 15-40 minutes and 3) low-carb, no sugar nutrition (with the exception of half a banana). Even with one healthy routine, a couple of other positive tend to fall into place.

 I have been without meds since the7th grade. I'm now in my mid 30's. The first 2 years of being off my meds I really let my mid wander and affected my concentration. 
It wasn't until my 9th grade year I started drinking coffee in the morning. I was able to concentrate and socially interact with people to the point where people didn't believe I even had ADD. 
These days I've reduced my caffeine consumption by 50% And have a fruit smoothie every morning for breakfast that I make myself. 
I also exercise regularly by practicing martial arts.  The challenge is I tend to focus too much on one individual activity. I must and do make an effort to consider others that count on me. Tbh without meds I’m a mess, my college has been on strike for almost 5 months and without classes to give me a sense of day and night I tend to sleep all day and to do things all night...
Sadly because my mum is against medication I’ve never had them, I never had coping mechanism either so I’m just alive and let life and karma do things for me...
Let’s say it’s great till I have to do something at a normal human hour or with a deadline and shit, then it’s a different story, I deal with it very badly, unable to stay focused more than 5 minutes on a good day and forget or procrastinate my appointements and it can turn bad :/ For the super important things that can’t be forgotten, I manage well enough. For everything else, I get by. After about the fifth day in a row forgetting to do a task or take something somewhere, my brain does manage to catch on. It’s like starting a lawnmower. I get there eventually.

Wish I could say I’ve perfected a routine, but I haven’t. I just let things go and maybe put a reminder in my phone if it’s dire. I have a drawstring bag that goes with me EVERYWHERE 
My wife absolutely despises it because it has seen better days, but it has all my most important things in it!

- Wallet
- Phone Charger
- Medication
- USB Key
- Work Swipe Card
- Lip Balm

This bag has been to 6 countries and is literally the only thing in my life that is always with me at all times. I have no health insurance. So seeing a doctor, therapist, and taking medication is nowhere near within my budget.

1. I have a specific way of keeping my room organized. I have a lot of art/sewing supplies, music related stuff, books, and makeup. All of my supplies go in their own bins, organized by type of art. Smaller things (pins, buttons, whatever) get their own small container and get put in a larger bin. Pens, pencils, markers all get their own individual pencil cups. This way, when I need something I only grab that one container and can easily put it back when I'm done. I keep everything in plain sight on bookshelves. Having to look at my supplies 24/7 makes me want to keep it looking nice. Every shelf has it's own subject/use.

My mom used to make me keep all of my art stuff in drawers and boxes. That was the worst, because I'd always end up just throwing all my stuff back in the box from laziness and I'd be immediately disorganized. I also hate having to dig for stuff when I need it. My system hasn't failed me yet.

2. I use my phone. Not pieces of paper or a paper calendar. I used to have paper planners and calendars but they never got used. With my phone, It's the one thing I always keep with me 24/7. I can create lists, set alarms, use the calendar, ect.

3. I don't carry a purse. If I carry a purse, I always end up losing stuff or having to dig through the garbage in it to find what I need. I have my wallet, keys, and phone. That's all I need. I keep chapstick, clothes, spare makeup, and other items I may need in my car. Better to go somewhere and forget what you need in the car than to have completely forgot it at home. If I go somewhere, 99% of the time I'm driving there anyways.

4. I need my sleep and I need a couple hours at the end of the day to relax. Without that, I get easily stressed out and anxious. Then I'm more likely to forget stuff or screw up whatever I have to get done. This is why I'm okay with having a routine schedule for work.

5. For cleaning the house... I'm still kind of bad at it. But I have my room organized in such a way where it's fast and easy to clean. Start some laundry, take out the garbage, and make my bed. All clean. I haven't made a schedule of it, but usually I change my sheets once a week. And I try to do my dishes immediately after I eat. I stopped taking my medication as it made me feel really anxious,

i get up at 6am on weekdays  and whenever on the weekends 

I go to the gym twice a day in the morning before work and at night with my fiancee.

ive started doing intermittent fasting where i start eating at 10am and have had all my calories by 7pm, i dont know why but this has recently start tto have an effect on my mood and remembering things.

also try something called the whole 30 diet ITS HARD but so rewarding once you cut al the shit out , i genuinely feel great.

also in this try doing an exercise routine called th 5x5 strong man it will come up in google straight away . having this goal with simple excercises really gave me the drive. yu start with an empty bar at first and every time you go you add 2.5kg to the reps every time you go. 

i use a slow cooker alot of the time for cause i just forget about food in the oven,

Ive also started to paint Warhammer and models THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST THING EVER  and really takes all my focus.


like with everything i have my bad days but try and keep your chin up 
 Bump for visibility.  Same as you, most of my coping strategies are designed so that I can forget without consequence.

* Put events on phone calendar ASAP

* Always have a tie and lanyard+ID in my bag *(work uniform)*

* Wallet + Keys are always in coat pocket.

I also use [a little keychain thing!](https://www.fidgetland.com/product/stephie)

I have not tried the slow cooker strat you've got going on, might have to try that one...

Nutrition-wise my best strategy is "trading": When I want junk food I consider what else I could spend that money on. One pizza that isn't good for me Vs. smoked salmon, cream cheese, watercress sandwiches... or on crackers *(drools)*... It suddenly becomes an easy choice. The more often I do it the more ingrained it gets, I can't count how many times I've gone to shops fully intent on buying only the worst of foods and come out with ingredients for a chilli or something. It's gotten so ingrained that I even struggle to buy fast food when I'm drunk now.

Meditation I've been slacking on, I try to do it for as long as I can be bothered when I'm trying to sleep.

I did see a therapist for a year, it was very helpful for understanding my ADHD, dealing with your own personal issues as well as pushing me to try these sort of strategies. [deleted] My slow Conner has been so wonderful for simplifying cooking! Yep all of these, except I do allow myself a late night and lie in at the weekend since I hate my weekday schedule so much. And I can't have so many reminders.

I would say I don't really "manage" but I do okay.

I would also add that I use a QR code alarm to force myself out of bed in the morning minus snoozing. At the weekends it does take me hours to get out of bed unless I am planning to meet someone.

Jessica's youtube video about ADHD cooking is also basically how I cook: Separate feeding yourself from cooking, utilise easy meals, don't leave the kitchen when cooking, unless leaving something in the oven/slow cooker. The soylent is a part of that, but it's expensive so I don't always get it. Cheap alternatives might be crappy microwave meals, instant noodles, home made smoothies. Awesome tips and systems. How has the sleeping habit impacted your symptoms/overall health and attention? The Mint app reminds me when the water bill is due each month. And my credit union offers free bill pay, so whenever the bill comes I can just schedule payment from the app on my phone. Thanks for the Forest recommendation ! This sounds like what I’ve been needing  Yeah, I'm having a tough time keeping up with a bullet journal. It was going to cure everything! But really, not so much haha. I just had so much hope for it, but writing spreads became too much work. My husband and I have Planner Pads incoming for July, so at least I won't have to worry about drawing up my weekly templates anymore! I just need to find a way to prevent all the paper from making its way into this new planner and making a home of it! 

Definitely struggling with all three of your unsolved challenges too. Good luck to both of us!  Just finally figured out how to upload pics to comments! New Reddit user so still figuring all this out haha How I manage my adhd https://imgur.com/gallery/0y4gu You could pm me your solutions, I'd like to hear them. I’m curious too. Greyscale? 😫😫😫😫😫 I can have like, one cup of tea or one can of soda. I'm on meds for my depression/anxiety (Welbutrin) and they help but they don't really let me have any more caffeine (alcohol is mostly fine for me though). I'm doing okay right now and not really looking to switch up my prescriptions in the middle of school but I'm graduating in December so I might start experimenting some after that. I do relax my routine on the weekends. Got to have some days off. Give Evernote a try, it integrates nicely between phone, tablet, and desktop. Also a nice scanning feature if you use paper notebooks but want to keep them in one place digitally. 

Good luck with all of them. Challenge #1 is biting me in the ass right now.  Love this so much. It’s really the same exact  situation for me!! If only i wouldn’t continue losing my damn notebooks If you have an iphone and press the home button three times, the screen goes to greyscale and helps you avoid getting sucked in as much. Can't remember if that's a default setting or you have to set it up but I think it's easy to do.  Wellbrutin is actually a stimulant so it's probably helping you on that front too(: how long have you been on it? Ah okay, I always read that "at the same time every day" to mean weekends too, which just kills me. It's annoying actually because with my job I could legitimately get up at 10 every day but I have a child and schools don't exist which open that late. Haha this is why I have so many, and write things down in multiple places! I also take pictures of what I write just in case.  it’s not default but if you go into general>accessibility>display accommodations>color filters>grayscale. then it’ll be on. 

you can set the triple click to toggle that, by going to the bottom of the accessibility page>accessibility shortcuts and then just select color filters. it’s possible on android too im sure. 

either way. if you have trouble with your smart phone pulling too much of you smart time, then i would recommend trying grayscale for a week and leave it the whole time. just to experience how much color plays into the demand on our attention.  Oooooo yes I’m gonna start taking pics.  Thanks for the idea !
