sometime's i can sense when I'm about to lose my train of thought, but is this hypocritical/ironic or justifiable? i get really frustrated when I'm trying to explain something of some importance (or outright angry depending on how important it was) before i lose track and forget details and utterly derail myself, and the person I'm trying to explain the thing to keeps goofing around, interrupting, changing the subject, or getting distracted.

inevitably i lose my train of thought right as they're like "ok ok sorry lol I'm paying attention now, so what's going on with this project?"

"... i don't fucking remember now. thanks. thanks a lot."

so now I'm frustrated or mad because i could tell it was going to happen and i needed to get it out, and they're frustrated or mad because they think I'm being petty or spiteful or something, i don't know.

note: my peers and coworkers know i have ADHD. I'm pretty vocal and outspoken about it and how it's affecting me. they're generally understanding and accommodating, but it's easy to overlook/forget how serious it can be in certain situations if you're neurotypical.  Give them, and yourself a break. The other person may be having issues, too. Make notes, especially if it's important. Or try explaining to them, in the moment, that you have to get it out before you lose it. 
And then, for yourself, don't beat yourself up for getting upset. It, as much as the attention issues, is part of adhd. Feel what you feel, but don't let it control you.
