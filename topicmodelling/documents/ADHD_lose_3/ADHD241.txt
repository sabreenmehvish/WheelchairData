Seeing New Psychiatrist Soon! Trying To Prepare... This isn't a "do I have ADHD" post--I'm 99% certain I do have the inattentive type.  I've reached the end of the road with my current psych doc (who's just a P.A.) meaning I've tried meds from every class with no real improvement in my symptoms, so she's sending me to a real psychiatrist, who I'm hoping will diagnose ADD instead of just focusing on anxiety & depression which has gotten me nowhere.  I don't do well relating my symptoms to doctors...at all.  I "present well" & want to fix that so I can get the best care possible.  

Here are some of the things I'm planning to bring up if she asks:  

- I'm extremely unorganized/forgetful.  I lose everything I touch.  I cleaned my 10x10 room & organized everything on Sunday; on Monday I spent 45 minutes looking for my deodorant, vitamins & other things I'd moved.  I ended up giving up because I couldn't find where I put them & was late getting out the door as a result.

- I'm constantly distracted.  I have to talk to myself out loud to get even basic things done.  Example:  "Okay, cereal.  Now go get the bowl & spoon..."  If interrupted, it takes an immense amount of brainpower & time to resume where I left off.  I often snap at people who interrupt my train of thought for this reason.

- My living space is a total mess.  I'm too tired to clean it, but when I do I can't find anything because it's not strewn about in front of my face.

- My mom is constantly on my case about being "lazy," "unmotivated" and lacking ambition.  But I'm not lazy--that would imply I ENJOY doing nothing.  I don't.  I just lack the focus/clarity/internal motivation to get things accomplished.  I feel like it's twice the work for half the payoff that other people get in terms of the rewarding feeling they get from getting things accomplished.  I only feel exhausted after getting things done.   

- Having to work so hard to focus is mentally exhausting.  After socializing or doing anything other than sitting in my room all day, I'm so mentally tired I can barely do anything other than stare at the wall.  I have sensory overload in places like grocery stores & get so flustered I can barely focus on what I'm doing.

- I don't drive due to anxiety & inability to stay focused or follow directions/find my way around.  I'm 34.  My confusion/distraction has almost caused wrecks when I attempted to drive in the city.

- I feel like a loser almost every day.  

These are just SOME of my issues; there are many others.  I was diagnosed with a learning disability (math) back in high school & had to sit in from recess in grade school to get my work done when it was quiet & there were no other kids around.  This is a life-long problem but because I'm an adult female who lacks overt hyperactivity, doctors have been reluctant to help me.  However I WAS ungodly hyper & impulsive as a kid.  (I also suspect Asperger's might be present but don't want to play internet doctor, lol).  I'm open to trying anything they suggest at this point.  

Thanks!~ I'm not sure what you're asking but I had a same-ish list+ the 'presenting to well' problem. When I went to my own appointment to get diagnosed I just brought that list with me. 

It helped a lot because I couldn't go blank and forget to mention half the things I wanted to mention and it was calming because if the conversation would go 'wrong' and the doctor wouldn't ask questions that I could work with, I knew I could say 'but what about this' and ask about the things that weren't covered. 

So yeah, print that list *now* or write it down and if you forget that, you can always take a minute during the appointment to find it in your post history. ;) 

*edit to add: I got asked a lot of yes/no questions, but feel free to add things/ask for clarifications, a lot of questions are pretty crappy. Like a big one for me was 'are you able to get to places on time?' I'm always on time, it's just that I'm there without having had the breakfast/shower I planned on taking. Same with 'are you able to focus?' that really depends on the thing I'm doing. So when you feel a yes or no doesn't really cover it, just keep talking.  I'd print this and take it with you to the appointment.  THANKS!  I'll definitely jot down or print the jist of this post because I think it sums up some of my bigger issues.  This is a free state-funded psychiatrist so I'm not expecting a great level of care but I've already informed them I suspect I have ADD & have take Vyvanse for it in the past. Thanks!  I'll definitely be taking SOME form of written info to the appointment.  Can't remember anything otherwise.   ðŸ™ƒ
