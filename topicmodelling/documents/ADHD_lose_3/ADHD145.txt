Adults with ADHD, what was your childhood like? I have a daughter with ADHD-PI and it is a daily struggle to keep her engaged, to keep her on time, to keep up her grades. I‚Äôm far from a perfect person and to be frank, I lose my shit with her on a regular basis.  I‚Äôm a working mom with a super type A personality and not a trace of ADHD.  I try to keep my cool, but it is impossible for me to not react to the things she does. 

How was your childhood? How did you interact with your parents, your siblings? How did you feel about yourself? How self aware were you?  What helped you to be ok with yourselves? 

I want to help my kid, and I want to understand what‚Äôs going on in her head.  Oh no. Do not lose your shit with her. That's the absolute worst thing. We already feel a ton of guilt and frustration and failure. We don't need it from others. She'll just end up with endless cycles of depression like I have. 

I was diagnosed as an adult, but I've had it as long as I can remember. I grew up confused. I knew I was different than everyone else.  I'd butt into conversations or talk over people. I'd zone out in class or when people talked to me. I was never on time. Nothing was organized. I was never motivated to do anything, even when I got a failing report card, until the very last minute. And sometimes even then I wouldn't do assigments. 

It sucked. People see you as lazy. You see yourself as awkward and worthless. You're constantly in fear of forgetting something. And I can't explain adequately how it feels to know you can do so much better.  The main emotion of my childhood was failure.  "I cheated myself like I knew I would. I told ya I was trouble.  You know I'm no good."  Because you can't get yourself to start projects early, you pull all nighters to meet the morning's deadline and end up turning in compete shit.  Then you resolve to fix it, but when you get a new project, the cycle starts over again.  Every once in awhile you surprise yourself and do your best work ever, but that feeling never lasts. Because in your hyperfocus on your best work, you either create a total mess somewhere else or completely forget something important. Then a teacher or your parent makes the worst, most soul crushing, comment: "I just don't understand how you can do so well but then so poorly. Why can't you get it together?  I know you can do so much better."  Yeah, me too.  But I can't.

I never had success for long. It was always, and I mean always, overshadowed by my next mistake.  For every good thing I do, I fuck up 3 others. It sucks. I hate it. I'm almost 28 years old, and after my boss found yet another huge mistake in my work, I could only say, "one of these days, I'll make it through a project without a huge fuck up, and you'll be so proud of me. Please don't fire me."   We both know that'll never happen, and I'll probably get fired one day when I make one big mistake too many, despite all my good work. That's the reality of ADHD. Blissfully unaware for too long, my parents kinda ignored my diagnosis after elementary school, so i was pretty much unaware of how it affected my life until late in college and wish I had realized it sooner, so I could have been working on it all along. I grew up in hell. Never good enough but smarter and more talented than everyone and hated for it.

My advice? Praise, jiu jitsu, learn a marketable skill before graduating high school. Lots of exercise, swimming is good, eat for your blood type. 

Art, music but low criticism. Did I mention praise? Lol Oh, exposure to lgbt role models. Look up female Asperger‚Äôs. Hugs, acceptance, visits with supportive relatives. Learn family tree, do non competitive family activities. 

Low expectations for grades. Cs are good. 

Learn the phrase, ‚Äúgood enough mom‚Äù üòâ you do not need to be supermom, you are good enough!

2am post, sorry if a bit disjointed. üòú I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until 21. 

I was raised by a single mom. I think she just assumed I was a naturally mischievous kid. I made a mess a lot and was always getting in trouble in school for being ‚Äúloud and disruptive‚Äù. She scolded me for a lot of these things, but for the most part just let me be because overall I was a good kid and she was probably also too busy working to provide for me. 

Academically, in the early grades I did well enough to get by. My teachers and peers have always said I was a smart/bright kid and even today randomly being told I‚Äôm smart is the most common compliment I get, so it‚Äôs easy to see how I got through school up to college. I bring up that point because I never studied and I certainly never did my assigned homework through the entirety of my time in school. Missed assignments or any kind of trouble resulted in getting these disciplinary forms sent home to be signed by a parent and students dreaded receiving them because usually it meant you‚Äôd be yelled at. Even getting one or two was enough to make the goody two shoes students cry, but I got dozens of them. I never faced the consequences because at the age of 9, I learned to forge my mom‚Äôs signatures or lie/talk my way out of trouble, lol. So my ADHD never really seemed like a noticeable issue because for all my mom knew, I stayed out of trouble and I was able to get good grades just by winging everything. 

I was also bad with rules in general. For example, even taking swimming lessons at the age of 5, when we had to wear floaties and do a little airplane in a circle, I thought that was lame so I just splashed by myself in a corner. Always just decided to draw and stuff like that in class. 

To my mom‚Äôs credit, she gave me a lot of freedom as a kid, so I played outside a lot, did my own thing, and had a great childhood. I naturally gravitated toward reading and writing at age 7, which ended up being my strongest skills to this day. 

As I said above, my mom and teachers often praised me for being smart, which did wonders for my self-esteem, but as I learned in developmental psychology, process oriented praise (praising a person‚Äôs actions) is better for children in the long run than person oriented praise (praising a person‚Äôs traits). [Side note: It‚Äôs one of the advantages boys are said to have over girls because for whatever reason, boys tend to receive more process oriented praise/criticism while girls tend to receive more person oriented praise/criticism, so boys are often better able to learn that their behavior matters and have better self-esteem]. Anyways I got scolded and shamed a lot by my teachers about my late assignments and tardiness, which really did make me feel awful. I spent a lifetime and the first two years of college feeling defective and like a failure. A few teachers did compliment my reading/writing skill and gave me praise, saying they felt I had a lot of potential and that really stuck with me and gave me hope that I wasn‚Äôt all bad and it‚Äôs probably the reason I continued to excel in those areas.

Anyways, that‚Äôs about it. Long story short, I had a childhood characterized by messiness, loudness, inability to do homework, and I probably would have gotten bad grades if I weren‚Äôt smart enough to get by. I don‚Äôt regret not being placed on meds and in fact I‚Äôd be reluctant to give my younger self meds if I could. All I would have liked is more understanding and a bit of hands-on help with things like homework.  I don't know if you can understand what's going on in her head.  It seems to be different for each of us but for me, the meds helped me understand what it's probably like in your head.  Essentially, my mind would never quiet down, but I didn't realize this wasn't normal.  It sounds like a stereotypical middle-east bazaar on some movie.  People yelling, crazy public performances, something going on everywhere, a feeling something 'bad' is going to happen (better always be on the lookout for the street urchins looking to pick your pockets, which of these are just scammers, etc).  It's almost impossible to comprehend until there's a juxtaposition.  When I took meds the first time all the voices quieted down.  It was horrible.  But it also showed me how different my brain was.  

As a result of this noise it's easy to become distracted and forget things.  I was able to cope, I think, by running my brain so fast that I would come back around to things that needed to be taken care of on the next 'distraction cycle'.  I do remember forgetting to complete homework constantly.  Threats and time spent in detention didn't help.  I grew more and more distant from my parents.  I don't know what my parents could have done differently, ADHD wasn't understood the same then as it is now and I wasn't diagnosed until well into adulthood.  I will say I wish I had been encouraged to do the things I showed interest and aptitude in.  I think [nearly] everyone with ADHD who finds their 'passion' can easily become one of the best in the world at it.  School will be difficult, it's designed to create little automatons that can be plugged into a factory line, and we're born to disrupt all forms of order.  It's also generally boring.  It might be ideal to just forget about great school performance and focus on other skills that she shows interest in.  Anything creative could be where she should be focusing.  Maybe if they had been more disciplined for me I could have at least completed the homework and avoided the detention.  But it's probably easy to be too discipline-focused and cause your kids to be angry at you to the point of resentment.

I still pretty much hate myself for all of the lost potential.  I don't know if I'll ever be okay with myself.  As a kid, it didn't bother me because I just followed my interests, but I think the push to create perfect college applicants has changed that freedom a bit.  As angry, annoyed, frustrated you get when she does seemingly random things or forgets her homework I can almost guarantee you she feels even worse once she realizes what's happened.  Apparently, we don't really understand ourselves as a group, but I know that I understand when I've screwed up and it tears me up.  I remember those screwups for years, sometimes decades, but the pain is just as fresh as if it happened only moments ago.  Look into RSD on here and elsewhere.  I think there's a bit of woo in it, but it does help to understand some of the other facets involved with having ADHD.  The emotional aspects are potentially even more devastating than the lack of attention and focus.

IDK, if you get here past the ramblings, just be patient.  She will not care about things you care about.  She just won't.  She'll care a lot about things you think are completely irrelevant.  She might appreciate a gentle nudge to keep her on task, or she might require a heavier hand.  It sounds just like all parenting - how do you know you're doing the right thing?  I think just by asking and trying you're on the right path. I was very blessed. My ADHD is more of the hyper-disorganized type, so I was constantly in a state of panic about having lost something, and I was the student whose desk got dumped out in an attempt to teach/shame them into cleaning things up, but I was also verbally and mentally fast and on-point. When I hyper-focused to an unusual extent (missing recess, math, and release time because I was completely unaware that they had happened) it was hyper-focus on something "good" (i.e. reading). Because of these two factors, I was always treated as being very smart. That became a core part of my identity and is, I think, the only thing that saved me as I grew older and it became clear that I was a hot mess in many (all?) of the other areas that matter in adult life.  You're a good mom. Make sure she learns some good coping skills to compensate for the ADHD. i.e. for me every item has its home, that way I don't lose anything. Except my chapstick because that's always moving in between pockets... 

Just don't get mad at her when she messes up because the real culprit won't even be in the same room to yell at.  Okay, you‚Äôve probably seen my other comments on here, but I just have one more thing to say: PLEASE practice self control. Don‚Äôt yell at her. Ever. I know it can be extremely frustrating, and I know you‚Äôre trying your best, but yelling does not help anyone. If you can yell something, you can explain it in a normal voice, and that won‚Äôt do emotional damage. I‚Äôm speaking from experience, here. My mother yelled at me a lot, as a kid. She still does, sometimes. I understand every other punishment she gave me, I understand the lectures, i understand how frustrated she must be. But nothing can rationalize yelling at a child. It does no good for anyone. It scares the child, and it just makes the parent feel like crap afterwards (at least, I hope so). Not to mention, it‚Äôs hard to predict what will elicit being yelled at, and unpredictability is *extremely* damaging for children. My relationship with my mother has been ruined, possibly irrevocably so, somewhat due to other things, but mainly because of the screaming.

I don‚Äôt want your daughter to end up how I did, but if you continue to allow yourself to lose your s***, she very well might. If you think you‚Äôll have a hard time learning to control yourself, think about getting a therapist, if you don‚Äôt already have one, and if you do, definitely talk to them, and ask for their advice on coping mechanisms, for both you and your child. [deleted] So I didn't get diagnosed until my freshman year of college at age 18 (I'm a girl, so my symptoms were undetected even though they were there). I've wanted SO badly to at least fake a type A personality lol, but unfortunately that's just not how it works. I'm not sure how old your daughter is, but props to you for wanting to understand!

You should know that [symptoms in girls are different from symptoms in boys.](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-in-girls-women/) If you haven't yet, definitely browse around the website that I just linked. There's a ton of great information and there's even a section for parents! If you do enough digging, you can find a lot of blogs written by women with ADHD or other parents of kids with ADHD that could be helpful as well.

My #1 tip for you is to help her have **structure** in her day-to-day life! Sticking to a schedule every single day, making to-do lists, using a planner/calendar, using the Pomodoro timers (you can find them online), and sticky notes are all so important for me to function.
I don't know how Pinterest-y you are, but there are a ton of awesome resources there if you browse around! I use a lot of free printables.

**How was your childhood?**
Looking back, I've always had symptoms. I didn't really know what ADHD was, so I had no clue as to why I was always late to everything, waited until the last minute to start anything, couldn't focus on anything to save my life, etc. Every report card throughout elementary school said something along the lines of, "she never stops talking," but I got really good grades up until high school, when every teacher constantly told me, "you're so smart but you just don't apply yourself," which was so so so frustrating. I thought I was applying myself....I remember my junior year of high school (which was when I really started struggling academically and got my first C) I would get so upset because I couldn't understand how someone could just decide to do their homework anytime they wanted...I would have to dedicate a whole day to just that assignment/project and have no other plans and force myself to focus on it, which would lead to me burning out about 2 hours in.

Socially, I was great. I was friends with literally everyone in my high school, played 3 sports, joined every club I could, went to sporting events, stayed out as late as I could, tried to never be at home, etc. I was pretty popular. 

**How did you interact with your parents?**
I was so dramatic. I still am. There was so much yelling and arguing and fighting between my mom and I. My parents were both always super supportive of me though, and helped me with any projects, sports, or homework that they could.


**How did you feel about yourself? How self aware were you? What helped you to be ok with yourselves?**
Since my social life was flourishing, I felt pretty great about myself. Academics weren't very prominent on my radar, but I ended up getting into a really good state school (where my grades were *thisclose* to getting me kicked out after a semester, I had no friends, and I was so anxious/depressed that I couldn't leave my bed unless it was to go get wasted).

The only issue I ever had with myself was that I always thought that I was annoying. I still think that, and I'm working on it. 

Having ADHD as a female is constant battle between how your brain works, how you want it to work, and how the rest of the world thinks it should work. It's exhausting, frustrating, annoying, and results in a lot of crying, but you really can't get away from it. Most of the time, you just have to go with the flow of what your brain is doing. The more I read stories from people like you, the more I see how perfectly my daughter‚Äôs aligns with the general narrative. I‚Äôve definitely lowered my expectations with her - not in a pitying, self-defeatist way, but rather to reduce the pressure on her and to avoid conflict.  She won‚Äôt respond to it in the neurotypical way, and she sure as hell doesn‚Äôt need the added stress.  Thanks for your input.   I have adult onset ADHD.   Jesus H Christ, you described my child perfectly. You also described how I mentally project her as an adult. Are you on medication? Can this future be avoided? Her medication definitely helps, but her appetite tanks when she‚Äôs on it, and she‚Äôs already so tiny and underweight we don‚Äôt want to increase her dosage.  So you thought everything was ok, and that you were an average kid?  I wonder if that helped you preserve your self esteem.  Your stream of consciousness is interesting.  :)  
I am working on acceptance.  This subreddit has helped immensely. My daughter is also very bright, and in the (numerous) parent-teacher conferences we are consistently told how smart and capable she is... when she applies herself.  We were told just this week how she can stare at her fingers in class for a solid half hour.  Homework is where the majority of our struggles are about, and the reason 90% of punishments (like no screen time, no play time until assignments are completed) are doled out.  

Thank you for the advice on process oriented praise.  I always try to "catch her being good" and praise her for it.  I know that the negative comments far, far outweigh the positive ones.  I'll work on it. Even though the schoolwork is the major issue we clash over, we also worry about the social aspect of it all.  She is so socially awkward it's painful to see.  Luckily she seems to finally have made some friends at school, so that she's not completely isolated.  I worry about her adult relationships and whether she'll be able to maintain friendships and romantic relationships.  We try to instill financial skills in our kids and talk about money frequently - there was a discussion about credit vs debit last night at dinner.  Hopefully at least she'll make good financial decisions. Thanks for the encouragement.  I try to understand and make allowances for the ADD, but it's hard as a parent who's trying to take a child to adulthood, and especially when there is a sibling who is the exact opposite of her sister.  It seems unfair to apply two sets of rules and expectations to kids being raised in the same household. Yes, thank you for the reminder.  I try, I really do... but I'm human too, you know?  95% of the time I bring the corrections down to a conversational tone, but I still think the repetitiveness of the messaging is damaging to her self-esteem in the long run.  But what's the alternative?  She needs correction, she needs to be aware of what's proper behavior (failing exams = bad), and I don't think she would reach any epiphanies on her own. It doesn't really sound as if you were affected or showed symptoms when you were a kid.  Looking back, could you see it in yourself?  I saw the other poster that said she/he has "adult onset" ADHD and find it hard to imagine suddenly developing characteristics only in adulthood. I so appreciate your response. It really highlights the spectrum of affectedness. My kid is nothing like how you describe yourself. She‚Äôs struggling in her classes, she‚Äôs struggling to make even one friend.... she‚Äôs just having a hard time at it.  She‚Äôs not the chitty-chatty social butterfly. I wish she were. It would make the hurt less painful. 

I‚Äôll check out Pinterest. Can you suggest some search keywords? [deleted] I forget the exact statistics, but my understanding is most children with ADHD grow out of it in their early to mid 20s.  But then there are people like me who will probably have it for life. Hopefully she's in the former. 

Honestly, I think my life would have been totally different if I knew about ADHD (the real deal, not the pop culture version) earlier. I was diagnosed at 26, so I'm still learning about ADHD.  I think the earlier she understands her symptoms and can find ways to cope, the better. A book that was helpful to me was "Your Life Can Be Better," but it's geared more towards late diagnosis adults.  But honestly, just understanding why I was doing the things I was doing and struggling so much helped lessen the self-blame and helped me tailor solutions. It's a trial and error process, and I'm still updating it.

For me, I have visual checklists for routine tasks. I force myself to take notes in every meeting, because I'll otherwise forget.  I've trained myself to confirm exactly what tasks I need to do and when at the end of every meeting. My car keys have their own key hook, even at work.  My wallet only leaves my purse when I'm paying for something, and I only have one purse so I'll never misplace my wallet. In the morning, I have an alarm set to go off every 5 minutes to keep me on track so I'm not late (my biggest impairment is time blindness, followed by rejection sensitive dysphoria, impulsivity, and inattention).  I also add 15 minutes to any estimation of time it will take me to compete a task, and if it's something I've never done before, I ask someone with experience how long I should expect something to take. In my office, I have two month calendar whiteboards to visually track deadlines and appointments. I'm a visual person, so if it's not in front of me, I won't remember. To that end, I have to be careful to put away tasks I'm not working on or I'll get distracted and tinker with them to the detriment of my big projects. It's a difficult balance. Also know that we tend to avoid big projects, so breaking them down into smaller sections helps us feel less overwhelmed and makes it easier to start a big task. 

I am on medication now, but I often forget to take it. I also get really awful headaches and spins if I don't drink enough water, which I didn't figure out until recently. Because I didn't understand the bit about hydration, the side effects turned me off of meds when I was first diagnosed. They help, but barely. I'm probably on the wrong meds or dose, but as any ADHD adult will tell you, scheduling even a doctor's appointment is an impossible task most days. 

Be patient. Help her find strategies that work.  There are books with great ideas to help get you started.  Just be aware that everyone is different and have different types and levels of their biggest impairments. I mean i felt different because I was often isolated with only 1 real friend a lot, but I just think I never really dwelled on anything long enough to put anything together that young, I also moved around a lot as a kid so that was a big reason for that btw. I always managed to do fine with grades without tryinh up until like high school, and even then it was only a few certain classes that were rough. Now college is an altogether different beast, that's when  I felt like ADHD was a significant handicap. But things can be very different from case to case, if you browse around hear you'll see people who have managed their own systems to stay productive, and others who struggle into late adulthood. Some people have other issues that end up emerging alongside ADHD, there's a loooooot of variation. The thing is, I can't really remeber too much of my child, so trying to figure out what effected me then is kind of speculative, for me personally, ADHD puts me in like a permanent state. You'll see a lot of people mentioning how ADHD really messes with your sense of time, like trying to manage further then a day ahead is a reaaaal chore, so i imagine as a kid, a lot of experiences must have bounced off me as I just kinda forgot about them.  I could see how one could argue that it might, and I‚Äôm not saying that it doesn‚Äôt, but in my personal experience I grew up unaware until I started reading about ADHD in late high school. I had very slow self-esteem and a lot of issues with depression and anxiety because, even in childhood, I had this perpetual awareness that I was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt quite place why I felt that way and it made me nervous about fitting in, talking to others, and being myself. But I couldn‚Äôt say with certainty that knowing I had ADHD would have helped that. I recently got an iPhone and using it keeps me from writing a book. Haha! Funny. When my sons were in school, until about age 16, we had an evening and bedtime schedule that really worked for us all.  :-)

After school was outdoors time. Bikes, skateboard,  rake leaves, mow, shovel snow, paper route, soccer practice, etc.

6 pm ‚Äî come inside for supper, homework, set out clothes and papers, etc, for school or projects tomorrow. Videos, games, and phone calls when the above was done.

One hour before bed was cooling down time (before the term was used for current  meaning)
Mantra- Brush teeth, brush hair, wash face, wash hands (at least lol). Or take a bath. It was a low stress time to read out loud, snuggle, and double check stuff for tomorrow, etc.  It was a real lifesaver, and a morning timesaver too. No more frantically looking for stuff right before the school bus came!

I had a neighbor who was shocked when my 15yo son had to stop mowing her yard and go inside for the night at 6pm. He had homework! (I had yhe last laugh tho‚Äô. Her 2 kids did not finish high school a few years later even tho they were and are very smart and talented.)

It was a bit more elaborate than that- after supper put dishes in the sink, put dirty clothes in the hamper, etc, but I hope you get the gist of it. My son says I should write a book! 

Also please see my posts and others‚Äô ADHD and Asperger‚Äôs posts on school assists. 

Take care! 

It made me feel really good to share, hoping that I might help others have a better life than I did. Thanks. Little tip: if you‚Äôre giving out punishments like no screen time, make absolutely *sure* she has no way of getting around it, i.e. making sure everyone in the house, whether family members or guests, know that she is not allowed to have any electronics, no matter how much she may try to manipulate them, and make sure to choose a different hiding place for phones/TV remotes/electronics each time you take them away, because otherwise, she could learn where you keep them, and then she will most likely just get them out and use them again when you‚Äôre not home, or when she‚Äôs alone in her room or something, thus negating the effectiveness of the punishment (I speak from experience, btw, as my parents did this to me).

Also, kind of controversial tip for helping her to focus on her homework: put something on for her to watch while she‚Äôs working on it, like a TV show or movie. You‚Äôd probably want to start out with something she‚Äôs already seen, that she likes, so she won‚Äôt be afraid of missing anything. See, for a lot of us, we don‚Äôt do homework because it‚Äôs *boring,* and we could be doing better (read: more fun) things with our time, like reading a book, watching TV, playing games, etc, so we just ignore it. By turning on something fun to watch in the background while she does homework, she‚Äôs not nearly as bored, and so she‚Äôs more willing to do her homework. I started doing this in college, and it‚Äôs worked wonders for me.

Lastly, if you see her start hyper-focusing on something productive, like a paper, cleaning her room, or something else, *don‚Äôt stop her!* Even if she has something else useful she could be doing, she‚Äôs actually doing this other useful thing, and she‚Äôs probably really happy with herself, because she‚Äôs actually doing something productive. It‚Äôs rare, but it happens. Breaking the hyper-focus kills that productivity, and will probably make her annoyed with you. I know more than a few times, I started hyper-focusing on homework or chores that I had put off for a long time, and being really happy that I was finally getting somewhere with them, only for that feeling to be ruined because my mom wanted me to load the dishwasher. Maybe the laundry needs folded, or the dishwasher needs loaded, or the floors need sweeped, but right now, she‚Äôs actually *getting something done.* if you notice it happening, try not to interrupt it. I‚Äôm not saying you do, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs happen to me a lot, and I figured I‚Äôd point it out, just in case. Okay, just warning you, try not to compare her to her sister, as that can be *very* damaging. Make sure to praise the good things about her, and do your best to remind her that her sister isn‚Äôt perfect, either. Don‚Äôt bash her, or anything, but don‚Äôt be afraid to acknowledge her faults. It‚Äôs good that you are able to bring it down to a conversational tone, but it‚Äôs better to not allow yourself to escalate to yelling in the first place. You are right that she need to understand proper behavior, but repetitiveness is better than fear and anger. It might not help her self-esteem, but I don‚Äôt think it will hurt it as much as you think. Although, to be honest, it is very hard to have a high self-esteem with ADHD. Just make sure that when you try to explain something to her, suggest some ways she might improve, as well. If you need ideas, you can always come back here for help!

In addition, you could also point *her* towards this subreddit, as well, so she can ask for help, too. If you can, try to let her account be private, or at least, don‚Äôt judge her for whatever she posts (unless it‚Äôs something dangerous, then obviously confront her about it). The thing with the correction part is that she probably knows that failing = bad, but she doesn't know what to do to fix it. She probably hasn't learned how to study (I didn't learn how until I was in college...). The most helpful tip I have on that is [figure out what kind of learner she is (visual, auditory, reading/writing, or kinesthetic) and work with that.](http://www.rasmussen.edu/student-life/blogs/college-life/most-common-types-of-learners/) For info and links to articles, ‚Äúadhd girls‚Äù and ‚Äúadhd parent‚Äù are both good, and for tools/printables/techniques ‚Äúadhd tools,‚Äù and ‚Äúadhd printables‚Äù bring up some good stuff! https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd-adults You sound very proactive and aware of your shortcomings, and have worked really hard to develop a system that catches you from falling down.  When did you get to the point where you realized that you could (and wanted to) work with this hand you've been dealt?  My daughter at 13 vacillates between trying a bit, and then letting her established systems fall apart.  It's mostly me and my husband establishing and then enforcing the system.  If we don't maintain it daily, she will not adhere to it.   That jives with what I'm seeing in my daughter.  Her sense of time, how long it should take to accomplish a task, and how time drifts away when she's focused on something that interests her is something we've seen for years.  I have a watch strapped onto her at all times, but it doesn't seem to catch on. I don't think awareness of ADHD helps with the social anxiety, and this is what emotionally hurts me and my husband the most - seeing her struggle to make friends is so sad. As a non-ADHD mom, I must have a completely different experience than you.  Are your kids ADHD?  I shudder to think about having ADHD myself, while trying to parent ADHD kids. Thank you for these tips!  I'll absolutely try the white noise approach to getting homework done.  Not the TV, that's a trap for sure, but maybe some music will help.  And yes, when I do break her focus from one thing to accomplish something else, she does absolutely get annoyed.  I see that 100%. I'm lucky in that my other daughter is extremely mature and sees her sister's impairment for what it is.  Not that there haven't been moments of jealousy, but nowadays it's more like the whole family bands together to help the ADD daughter get through it. Yes!!! We had a meeting with the school counselor and have set up testing on April 3 precisely to determine what kind of learner she is.  I‚Äôve told her what my studying techniques were when I was in school, but obviously she is a different person and there may be a better method for her specifically.  To be honest, I still struggle with keeping my systems in place. To this day, I'm not sure if my parents helped me or hurt me by enforcing structure growing up.  The moment l moved out, my parents no longer enforced the structure. When I got to college, I did okay in the dorm, but promptly failed out my second year when I moved off campus. It really wasn't until I decided for myself that I had to claw my way back into college and graduate that I started learning how to manage myself.  For me, I had to go through the pain and embarrassment of failing out in order to realize how important structure is. But I won't lie to you; even now I go through weeks where I couldn't be bothered to follow my own structure.  If I didn't have a stable, deadline-focused, and firm schedule career, I'd be in rough shape.  It's a blessing and a curse because I often feel I've set myself up for failure in becoming an attorney.

I think the hardest part for me growing up was knowing how much I struggle compared to others. I'd get caught in this trap of doing well with my routines and systems, then kidding myself into thinking I was able to do what others could.  You don't want to be the person who has to put in all this extra work to function. You don't want to be abnormal.  (It isn't that thought out, but I usually lull myself into a false sense of being able to tackle anything after a few weeks of good habits. It never ends well. Eventually, you learn, but I still do it about once or twice a month.) I actually got a watch a few months ago to try and help, and I just forget to check it lol That‚Äôs good. If you can afford it, look into getting a smart watch. My daughter has her daily routine programmed onto it.
