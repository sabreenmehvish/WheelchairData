In what way should I describe ADHD to friends who don't seem to understand or jump straight to 'omg same!' whenever I attempt to describe symptoms. I realise it's common even without ADHD to sometimes lose concentration but my friends seem to imply that I'm exaggerating it by saying the same happens to them. How do I say it so they will understand why I do some things and may sometimes need help for others? I like using the example of two other mental disorders that are (somewhat) better understood, depression and anxiety. Lots of people get sad or scared sometimes or in certain situations, but people with depression and anxiety feel these things much more often and with greater intensity, to the point that it stops them from doing things they want or need to do. ADHD is the same way. Most people will have impaired executive function *sometimes* (when they're tired, drunk, hungry, doing something really boring, etc.) but a person with ADHD has lower-than average executive functioning most or all of the time. This is a struggle for sure and, unfortunately, this happens at any age so you'll probably find a lot of ways people deal with it. Here's what I did:

Assuming you like your friends because they are good people, then you can probably appeal to their empathy. For example, ask them to imagine they're you. They've just told their friends that their brain moves painfully fast through several thoughts and is making it impossible to focus on one thing to the point of limiting you ability function. Now when the world tells them *they're* exaggerating or making things up as an excuse, they might as well be hearing that they're delusional and its all in their head, and that means you're a liar. Remind them if they were in a similar situation, you'd believe them because you're friends and don't have to lie for each other's attention.

Most people feel regret at this point and become apologetic and embarrassed. That's when you can show them that you understand it's hard to believe something you can't really see, but that you'll need their help sometimes because ADHD can cause anxiety and depression and good friends are, in part, a great cure. Hopefully, they'll see you're going through something real.

If none of this works (which has sometimes happened), then maybe life is giving you a reason to get new friends and you'll be better off. Hope that helps :) I've discovered that most people actually don't believe me.  My partner absolutely did, my step mom does, because she noticed a difference in me since I started meds.  But my bio family believes - like I used to - that ADHD doesn't exist, out that if it did, it's a personal failing that requires more discipline/exercise/special diet.  So I don't bring it up to them.  It's just too frustrating to not be believed.  I think it's common for us ADHD folks to have trouble with filters, so that's something I've been reminding myself: not everyone needs to know all of my inner thoughts.  Especially when they think you're just trying to lose weight or making it up.  I've got my awesome hubby and another friend who believe me, and my psychiatrist who I can vent to once a month. I don't know if it feels the same way for everyone, but the way I describe it is that it doesn't mean I can't concentrate on something. It just means that I can't choose how I concentrate. I'm very one-track-minded, and if I'm thinking about one thing it's to the exclusion of everything else in the universe. I swear sometimes I'm surprised I don't forget to breathe. But then something else comes along and I totally lose whatever I was just thinking about. Most people seem to be able to juggle a number of tasks and responsibilities without totally forgetting half of them, but my capacity is much more limited. [This XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1106/) probably explains it best.

I would also say that it's okay if your friends believe they sometimes experience the same thing. Mental disorders generally happen on a spectrum-- it's not like people with ADHD have some extra section in the brain that does things that never ever happen in typical brains. It's just that our brains behave in ways that are really lopsided, limited, or exaggerated compared to other people. So if your friends say "oh yeah, sometimes I walk into the other room and forget what I went in there for," say, "OK, now imagine if stuff like that happened to you *all day long* and there wasn't much you could do about it."  Same. I don't bother. [Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/add.png)

I have trouble describing it because I have it one moment and lose it the next.
