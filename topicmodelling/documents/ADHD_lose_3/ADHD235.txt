Thinking something only to forget... Anyone else experience this? All the time...I'm thinking about something and I think of something really clever or important etc. then I immediately forget what I was just thinking.

I'm very creative. Often these thoughts are plot-points for my writing, or lyrics for my songs...

...I wonder how great my songs and novels would be if they actually were made up of the ideas I had for them that I instantly forgot the moment I came up with them. This is me as well, I'm a poet, singer/songwriter. On the days I'm in the flow it's brilliant, ideas come, I note them down, satisfaction abounds! But.. more often my creativity sparks too many ideas and they fly off into the never-never and I think, damn, what was I thinking again.. it's gone. I just do my best to draw down what I can and let the rest go.. :) There are a few things you could try : 

* Keep [this pad](https://www.thelibrarymarketplace.com/products/do-something-amazing-notepads)(or homemade version you can print multiples of) close by at all times.
* Try the apps 'Notin', and 'Keep'
* Use the voice recorder on your phone
* For those situations where you can't have your phone with you (ex : group music or choir practice) I carry a very small [USB Voice Recorder of this type](https://www.amazon.ca/Brothers%C2%AE-Portable-Digital-Recorder-Silver/dp/B00UCVWDK2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1537124329&sr=8-4&keywords=voice+recorder+usb).

Despite these tricks... I still keep forgetting some things, but not as much as before. That's why I keep sticky notes everywhere.  Or maybe you could dictate notes in your phone?
