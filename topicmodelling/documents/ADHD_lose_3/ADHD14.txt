When you go into manual breathing mode, lose attention, and then forget to breathe **! ! Reminder: don't forget to breathe** This happens to me to a lesser degree.  I slow my breathing down and start breathing really shallowly. Then I notice that I don't have enough air and have to take some deep breaths. I do this to..This is one of those moments when distraction is your best friend.  It helps to relieve the panic and reset your natural breathing rhythm.  Pets are a great distraction.. Wait this is a thing that happens to other people???
