Things I know I'll forget I always remember and things I know I'll remember I always forget. "Lunch on Saturday with a friend?? Aagghh I'll never remember that!" Spend all week thinking about it. 

"If I put my keys right here I'll never lose them again. This is the new key spot." Immediately forget and don't think about keys one time until I habe to drive again. My favorite is that I always forget to take the medicine that helps me remember.  This made me think of that scene in the first Harry Potter where Neville has a remember-all and it tells him he's forgotten something, and he goes "the problem is,  I can't remember what I've forgetten." Holy shit. I was actually having a conversation with my friends that every sorting quiz puts me in Gryffindor but I feel like hufflepuff but if anything in the Neville of Gryffindor. SAME! I feel like a hufflepuff but I always get put in Griffindor and it annoys me. Neville must be an ADHD Griffindor hahah HE IS US
