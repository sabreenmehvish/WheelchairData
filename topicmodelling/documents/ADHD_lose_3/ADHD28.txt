What strategies do you employ to help combat your ADHD? If this gets a good response, I'll add everything to a list, organize that list, and see if the mods are interested in making a sticky of that list.

So, anything and everything, what do you do to help you combat your brain?

Edit 2: I'm loving the responses. I'm going to start compiling a list of things right here.

---------------------------------Daily Life---------------------------------

* Have a set location for things (phone, wallet, keys, etc.). Try to keep them in a designated spot at home and use the same pocket/pouch to store them when you are out. Form a habit of checking these pockets/pouches to ensure the item is there.

* Use a calendar! Find one that works for you. Many have recommended using Google Calendar. Personally that doesn't do it for me, but [Desktop Calendar](http://www.desktopcal.com/) works pretty well for me. Find one that works for you and you'll never miss an appointment again! (assuming you have a way to remember to add it to the calendar.. if you do, please share!)

* If you need to remember to bring something with you that you normally don't have to bring (ex. the project you've been working on, or a folder of documents, etc.) PUT SOMETHING VITAL IN OR ON THE ITEM! Something like your car keys, or your phone. Something you can't reasonably leave the house without. Or put the item in the shoes you'll be wearing. Make it impossible for you to leave without first directly interacting with the item you need to take.

* For recurring daily tasks, print out a list of them and pin it up somewhere visibly. Laminate it for bonus points.

* Notes! Make a note of everything you need to remember for later. Just got assigned an assignment? Note it in your notebook. Get the due date, and then add it to your calendar.

* This is a good one from /u/sillydancingness - "I am also working on accepting myself more, and not beating myself up for stuff. I try to recognize progress when I make it, and focus on what I did well. That helps with the guilt, and reduces some of the stress." - learn to forgive yourself, folks. You can't stop yourself from showing your ADHD all of the time, but you can decide how you react to it.

---------------------------------Focusing---------------------------------

* Music tends to help a person focus. It is often best to choose music without words. For me, it's video game music (message me for a massive list of VG music). For some it's metal. For others it's classical. Whatever works for you, it's out there.

* Take breaks! I'm seeing this one a lot - work for ~30 minutes, then break for ~15. This helps many to recharge for the following 30 minutes of work.

* EXERCISE! I know.. exercise isn't fun for most people. But the benefits are real. Exercise helps to produce more dopamine (our problem is a lack of dopamine, so this is a huge bonus). This will help to calm our brains which helps us focus on something since our brains aren't working so hard to try to force us to find stimulation.

* Meditation! I haven't done this much myself, but I have heard that the benefits are many. I'm sure you can find some help in this sub to get started.

* Diet! One user suggested that the effectiveness of meds seem to be decreased if they eat a lot of carbs, but increased if they are fasting. My experience agrees with this. It's a good idea to learn how your diet affects your cognition.

---------------------------------Productivity---------------------------------

* I recently started incorporating ["No more zero days"](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/?st=j9sng6a5&sh=d73a4a39). The linked comment is a long read, but the gist of it is that you don't spend a single day that doesn't involve at least a *little bit* of work towards your goal. Whether it's an hour of work or a minute, make it happen every single day. (Bonus: Once I get started, it's easier to do an hour and quit than it is to do a minute and quit! So this mentality is great for getting me started.)
 Feal like you forgot something. I always do a patdown check..phone,wallet,money in wallet,keys ect.I misplace a lot of things and a physical list will make me lost for a few hours.. Don't put things in an abnormal place.. Always have 1 location for your everyday take with you items. Eye contact is a hard thing for me. I repeat what the person says in my head to make sure im not being disrespectful. I listen to music when doing literally anything. Music is something for me to grab onto so I can keep track of what I'm doing. Take breaks. If you're studying for a class, doing taxes, whatever that is tedious and boring... take a break every once in a while! Im currently working on my masters without meds, and taking breaks (and tons of caffeine) has helped me a ton!

I tend to break it up into 30 minutes of work equals a 15 minute break. Doing this recharges my energy, and helps me stay decently motivated and focused  Ditto Google calendar.  Time awareness is a real struggle for me as is memory.  I have the app on my phone and always set two alerts- one for a day prior so I'm not taken by surprise and can gather any  necessaries when it's not the last minute, and one for an hour before so I get out the door in time.  I will also set a timer if I want to (for example) kill some time on a video game and not lose 4 hours of my life to it.  Timers also help a lot when I have stuff to get done but I'm overwhelmed by the size of the task.  I can do anything for half an hour.  I clean my house in half hour increments which helps a lot to not get bored and wander away, scattering cleaning supplies as I go...  I'll start us off. First, thanks to /u/fishes220 for the idea.

Computer Assistance: I use [this desktop calendar](http://www.desktopcal.com/) to help prevent myself from forgetting everything from psych appointments to cleaning the litter box.

Daily Life: Have to remember to bring that folder to the psych's office? Put your keys in the folder, put the folder where you can't miss it (like in the middle of a doorway you'll have to walk through before leaving). I've read in a sub (I think it was /r/productivity) about the Ten Minute Project. The OP told his situation, working a 9-5 job and having side projects at night on his home office. He made himself focus only 10 minutes that night at a given task, no matter what, and if it gets accomplished, he made his goal and advanced the project 10 minutes ahead. Sometimes this little accomplishment starts a reward feeling making him go ahead on another task and so on. The purpose is to break things in smaller pieces, to clear the fear of facing an enormous and tiring activity, exactly what people fail at most, and by making little achievements he's able to go ahead and sometimes focus on longer hours. I shall start with tips. 
Schedules will keep you organized on day to day activities,
Stay positive. Negativity gets you nowhere.
Break down bigger assignments or papers into smaller segments.
Music, get rid of outside noises with music.
Exercise, Gets your brain pumping and ready to go.
Don't work in a cluttered space. 
Stick to one project at a time. 
Use a timer and go for 15-30 minute intervals.
Know that what you don it won't be perfect. 

Edit more Tips. Tidying up a little Touching me, such as placing a hand on my shoulder or arm, when telling me something can help me focus on what's being said and retain the information I'm being told. If you really don’t want to lose something, try physically attaching it to you, if possible. My office automatically locks when the door closes, so to avoid being locked out, I keep all my keys on a lanyard that I tie around one of the belt loops on my pants. That way, I can never leave my office without my keys. 

You can do similar things for wallets and keycards, if you keep those in your pockets. If you sit down and want to make sure you don’t leave a bag/backpack behind, loop one of your legs through one of the arm loops on the bag in such a way that it gets in the way when you stand up. 

I’d forget my own head if it weren’t attached, so doing this has really helped me.  I've found smelling salts can often help snap me out of a mental funk when I feel myself start getting frustrated or restless.  * I have a list of things I need to remember to do every morning, printed out and pinned up in my bedroom.
* I take Adderall twice a day. I prefer this over one large dose, since I have better control over how I spread out my focus if my days are looking unpredictable
* I stretch, meditate, and do some short exercises every morning (well... most mornings). Meditating just seems to come naturally on meds, and any kind of adrenaline surge seems to help raise focus.
* Fucking notes EVERYWHERE. Notepads, spreadsheets, also about two or three MyInfo document trees. Actually, I just recently bought a small digital recorder, just so I can quickly make some voice memos to myself without fumbling with my phone.
* Learn how diet affects your brain stimulus. This is probably person-dependent, but it generally appears to be a good idea to avoid consuming enough carbs as to spike and crash blood sugar levels, as this will alter dopamine receptivity; I've found meds don't even help at all when I was eating a lot of carbs. Fasting seems to have the opposite effect, as it puts the brain into an active "hunger" state, kicking dopamine receptors into high gear.
* There's probably more, but I forgot One thing that works for me (and won't for everyone) is to take a project that you HAVE TO DO (such as write a long Historiography essay) and create a reward.  
  
For me, I bought some manga from Japan that were sealed so I couldn't open/peek... but I put them on top of the fridge and told myself that I couldn't read/open/interact with them until I finished it.  What works for me with that system is that I have 2 senses of achievement:  I finished said paper AND I successfully held myself accountable.  
  
My other life hacks are similar to what is listed above, though I have extensive use of a bullet journal to help me. The only problem is when I get the zoomies on it, and tweaking it/drawing in it/trying to put ideas into practice become the sole thing I care about.  (Then with the obvious follow up of "DOING THIS AGAIN IS SUCH A HUGE COMMITMENT, I DON'T WANT TO OPEN MY BUJO OR DO ANYTHING WITH IT BECAUSE IT'LL REMIND ME THAT I DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH AGAIN" - and we all know that hiding from an inanimate object means that the perceived shameful behavior doesn't exist, right?  ................................Right??) If you're like me and have a hard time keeping your space clean:

Minimize how much trash you generate in the first place by using reusable things instead of disposable as much as possible. And put trashcans everywhere.

Make a rule of only eating in the kitchen, because once dishes go into my room they never come out.

Try to eliminate "extra steps" where you get hung up. For example, I always leave my clothes on my bed, so I put my bed right next to my closet so I can put them away directly without even getting up. 

I prefer open storage, shelves, baskets, or clear drawers where I can see everything, to things that enable me to hide a mess. For Father's Day my wife bought me the tile. I highly recommend it to all my fellow ADHDers out there who are prone to misplacing items. Typically I would lose my keys my wallet and things like that locally around the house and I can use the Tile app to locate them. But it also has limited geolocation so it uses Bluetooth to tell you the last known area in case they're outside of the local radius. So it's been a huge Lifesaver for me. LOL of course this means you absolutely cannot lose your cell phone. 1. If you have sleep problems listen to a sleep podcast or any boring one.

2. When you are doing work or need to focus, try playing something else in the background. Varies for people but I go on YouTube and put on gameplay. Really helps me focus! 

3. Try to watch movies with friends. I don't know if it's just me but I'll get bored and distracted during long movies even if it's something I enjoy. But watching with other people "forces" me to sit down and watch. I used to physically attach my work id + bus pass to my hip on one of those zippy lanyards when I left for work in the morning, and not take it off until I got home. When I took it off, it went in 1 pocket of my bag. managed not to lose it more than a few times for 5 years!



I still have not found the ideal planner situation, but one thing I do is note appointments in my phone right away, as soon as I make the plans. I want to try the bullet journal. I think I will buy a new notebook for it today, as motivation. 



I am also working on accepting myself more, and not beating myself up for stuff. I try to recognize progress when I make it, and focus on what I did well. That helps with the guilt, and reduces some of the stress. 



I have also started to limit the choices I give myself. Rather than have a list of things to do, and tons of options, I try to give myself a choice of 2 things to do, and not worry about the efficiency. If I try to be efficient, I waste too much time thinking about what I am going to do, rather than doing something. I treat my brain like a toddler, giving a little freedom so I don't fight myself or feel confined, but doing "good" things.  It looks like most of my strategies are already called out here, which is awesome!

But i want to recommend a couple apps (that work across desktop and phone) which are SUPER helpful for me.

Trello replaces a system of sticky notes I used to have a work. It functions basically as a digital set of cards that you can order in different lists. (So I have To Do This Week, Today, Doing, Blocked, and Done lists.) Each Card gets moved as I go, so when I get distracted I can quickly see what I was working on before. You can also add more detailed notes and check lists to each card for more granularity. This whole setup is great because I just pull up the desktop app at work, and I have it easily available all day wherever I go.

Todoist - a different digital todo list, but it works better for me for non-work things. This one is awesome because you can do normal, scheduled, and recurring tasks. So, in the create task box you type “Pay Rent every month on the 20th.” Boom. Now every month on the 20th an item pops onto my todo list to go pay rent. I use this for everything I need to do at home. Thank you for this. 

I've also started using timers; it helps with the time-blindness. I’m with on the video game music. I’m currently listening to the Xenosaga series music while I’m writing a lit review. Personally I color code things especially for paperwork or school. I will put important documents in a red binder, I have school assignments, lecture notes, projects, labs, in a binder each having its color coded section. I also try to break any big project down to smaller more manageable projects.  Yay!!! I made a post similar to this not long ago but it didn't get much of a response. No karma jealously I promise I'm just excited for the idea of more tips 😄😄

Here's what I had on my list 


-Always writing down where I parked my car in my phone 

-Each night leaving a postit with all the things I need to do the next day on the back of the door 

-The medisafe app (found on this sub 😁)

-The clue app to track menstruation (I've used this for a while it's great for Dr: 'when was you're last period?' Me: 'Ummmmm') 

- Having an extra large key ring to help me not lose it

-having a spare hairbrush, deodorant and mints in the car and in my handbag. Just cause I'm forgetful doesn't mean I have to be gross. 

-Before I got diagnosed I got an implanon put in, my God is it safer than relying on my memory to be 100% certain that I took the pill same time everyday, and always remembered to fill my script

Since I wrote that post the other MAJOR thing I've found is asking for help without shame. As well taking a beat to honestly think about my 'work arounds 'as evidence of me finding solutions to things I struggle with not evidence of my failure. 

For example I've registered with the disability unit at my uni and they offered me more reading time during exams. I was honest and said thanks but I can't really remember anything from reading time anyway, they offered me a highlighter. It's something I never would have thought to ask for but immediately knew would be a big help. 

I've also spent a lot of my time feeling 'stupid' because I can't remember directions, but then I thought about it a what harm comes of me using my GPS to get to my friends place every time? It doesn't mean I don't *care* enough about my friend to remember how to get there, it's just that I've found a simple harmless solution to something I have difficulty with. 
 Read my post on my profile This! I used to lock myself out of the house at least once a week or forget my wallet at home but I had to train myself to never let my keys or my wallet leave my hands unless I was putting them back in my purse. Been like a solid 2 years since I've locked myself out, miraculously!  I have a list on the homescreen on my phone. It's from an Android app, ColorNote. It's super useful. [The Pat-Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqXZ9YoRD50) ^^ this—Every morning, I do the “phone, wallet, keys, and ‘deez’” dance as I head out the door.  Usually the “deez” step involves a Gangster-rap style nut grab then waving my middle fingers to declare victory. Sometimes I substitute that step for going back inside to turn off my air conditioning.  👽

Haven’t locked myself out since I made that a habit! This is the hardest part for me by far-- managing the forgetfulness, which tends to go hand-in-hand with consistently running late.

A few things have helped me with this:

* I have designated "stuff" places right by my door. I have a tray for incoming mail that needs action, and my recycling bin right beneath it for non-essential mail. I seldom lose bills, invoices, etc. anymore, and my clutter problem is soooo much better.
* I have multiple sets of my car/apartment keys, and my spare key-ring is hung right next to the door, so I'm never late from "can't find my keys" anymore. Same goes for shoes & socks-- they all stay right by my door so I can't be late because of trying to find a match.
* The SECOND I realize I need to bring something in from work or home in the future, I add two events to my google calendar: one for the day before and one for the day of. For example, last week, I was in charge of bringing the Halloween decorations in for our corner of the office. The MOMENT it was assigned to me, I whipped out my phone and created the two events in my google calendar that said "put Halloween box in car. Do it NOW!" I have alarms go off on my phone to remind me of these events in the evening, and I only click "snooze" on the alarm until the task is 100% done-- so every 10 minutes, my phone nags me to git 'er done.
* Generally speaking, if there's something I know I need to bring into work, I put it in my purse or laptop bag immediately when it comes to mind. I literally stop everything and do it in that moment so I can't forget it later. 

I have meticulously designed processes to keep me from getting boned too often by the same thing, but there's always something new to forget that I haven't quite hacked out a solution for yet. Like everything with ADHD, it's a work in progress.

 This helps me a lot. There's playlists on spotify with focus music, calm and chill, just to make a background on my mind noise. I agree, for me it has to he music without words or else I'll get distracted by the lyrics Ya I put my keys on my wallet and anything else I need I put under my keys... can't go anywhere without your keys right? Thank you for that desktop calender idea, that is genius! :) now to remember it when I get home :)  I am trying the calendar now - thank you! Great suggestions. I got a wallet with a big pocket for my phone and a ring attached to the outside so I can clip my keys to it. It's big and bulky and a pain in the ass but I never forget it or misplace it because I'm so worried about losing everything at once.

Google calendar is a godsend. I made 3 calendars - one for daily work, one for reminders and one for things I need to do or remember and events I might want to attend. I put EVERYthing in there, like you. Structures my whole life. Also makes it easier to relax - when there's a blank slot I know I can 100% chill. Reminds me a lot of ["No more zero days"](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/?st=j9sng6a5&sh=d73a4a39) (long read, but motivational). This is something I’ve really wondered about, could you elaborate a little more on what it does for you? Sometimes I just need a quick shock to get me back on track. That's interesting.. Something to shock the brain a bit I suppose?  > Fucking notes EVERYWHERE. Notepads, spreadsheets, also about two or three MyInfo document trees. Actually, I just recently bought a small digital recorder, just so I can quickly make some voice memos to myself without fumbling with my phone.

Alright I'm convinced that you're an investigative journalist.

Thank you very much for the list of things! That last part is something that I really struggle with too. I don't know how to get through it.

Self-therapy moment after this - tl;dr, probably we need to work through the shame we associate with the behavior more so than behavior itself, otoh that sounds really hard and honestly scary.

I suspect the key is going to be coming to terms with the fact that I have never once followed through with anything, and I probably never will. Maybe if I can accept that part of myself, there won't be as much shame associated with "quitting" or "failing" at commitment and it will be easier to start over/recommit? I definitely fall into the trap of, "Well I broke the streak of doing it (running, flossing, Duolingo, every planner I've ever tried to use) so now I will never do it again," which is so obviously a toxic mindset, and yet I've heard myself *actively reinforce it* into a self-fulfilling prophecy. It never helps to essentially shame yourself for shaming yourself, but I need to find the middle ground of accepting my flaws and difficulties as part of myself, without embracing them as OK.  I like all of this. I also have clothes on my bed... I'm just not done with them yet, *okay?!*

Like.. if I wore a shirt for an hour yesterday, that shirt is going on my bed. It isn't dirty. It doesn't need to go in the dirty bin. But obviously it can't be hung up with the clean clothes. Pretty much the same with a pair of jeans and a jacket. I thought about having my wife get me a couple of these for my birthday or Christmas. (The number of nice jackets I’ve lost or had to search all over the city for...)

I may just have to go for it. Thanks! I got a warning message upon going to the site, so use at your own risk I guess. I've never had a problem with it though. In fact I downloaded every song on this site and stuck them in my phone.

http://vip.aersia.net/ Literally just locked myself out of the house this morning. Same for me except I put a hook near the door where I always make sure to keep my keys as soon as I enter the house. Im so bad at locking myself out! My idea of security is at minimum at least 5 friends/neighbours/family members having a spare!  I've actually heard that instrumental/classical music is the best for anyone who is trying to focus on something. Shit works wonders. You can try, but hopefully you don't get very far! Reminder.  I'm guessing that is all it is, is a quick shock.

I think of it like a defibrillator. Defibrillators are used when the heart is basically being flooded with electrical signals that are too noisy/energetic for the heart to use to beat effectively. It works by literally shocking the heart which kind of resets things (have you tried turning it off and on again?) and clears up the noise.

My guess is the smelling salts work the same way. Brain is too noisy/energetic, so a quick shock via sensory overload kind of reboots things. I think it forces me to stop thinking about everything for a few moments. And it's definitely a shock to the system for a a few brief seconds. They're super easy and cheap. You can buy a 10 pack on Amazon for like $4. Give em a shot. As long as you aren't eating them or doing anything crazy, they have virtually no potential negative side effects.  I take notes on everything, but I have one rule for myself... all notes end up in one place and all task end up in one calendar (with the exception of work and personal being separate) > Alright I'm convinced that you're an investigative journalist.

Honestly that probably should be my profession

It is literally absurd how much online research I do on a daily basis for any given topic It works great until you lose your cell  Lol, me yesterday  Locked myself out 3 times in the past month.  It's getting pretty silly now.  I'm gonna try to follow the advice above! You are doing gods work! Thank you :) Yeah, I think that's what's going on. I've talked to my psych about it and he said it's a reasonable idea in principle, but there's no research or clinical studies to support it. Its obviously not the stated purpose of them, either, but they're pretty benign. He's skeptical of a physiological mechanism of action, but he said if it works for me, and I'm not abusing them (I go through a box of 100 every 5 months or so) , then he's totally fine with it.
