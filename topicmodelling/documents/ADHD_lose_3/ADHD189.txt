How do I stop being late?! It’s NOT that I don’t care or value other people’s time!!! 

I just can not for the life of me motivate myself to wake up earlier than I think I really need. And then I spend too much time on the wrong things and suddenly it’s time to leave and I still haven’t brushed my teeth or found clean socks or whatever. 

I’m desperate. It took losing a job over my punctuality problems to develop a strong enough paranoia to counteract the ADHD (and let's be honest, a bit of bad habit besides). 

Basically I just plan my morning around arriving 10 minutes early to work (or wherever). I still wake up with a margin of only the number of minutes I need to shower, clean up the cat box, and take the dog out, and nothing extra. But, because it's all geared towards 7:50 rather than 8:00, I always arrive around 7:54 and I'm still technically early!

Having things ready to go the night before also helps. I always keep things like keys in the same exact place so I don't waste time looking for them... but I'll admit that a lot of what helps me is the fact that my partner is very organized in spite of my chaotic nature.  I literally just came up with this plan and I’m going to try it tomorrow. I don’t know if it will help you, but it’s a combination of different ADHD strategies I’ve read about:

1. **Write down your morning routine.** Not your ideal morning routine, your actual, “this has to get done” routine that you already do every morning. Every necessary step. I have 11, including giving my husband a kiss goodbye. (I wanted to put “do makeup” and “set up for dinner” on there but I don’t do those now and brevity is key.)

2. **Tape the written routine to the bathroom mirror.** Mine is inside my medicine cabinet.

3. **Download Alarmy,** or another take-a-picture alarm clock app.

4. **Set the alarm** to give you exactly as much time as you need to get ready. You probably don’t actually know what this is, but the intent is to not give yourself time to kill once you’re ready. (I’ve learned trying get up early just means I’ll look at my phone in bed until I’m even later than usual, so don’t try to be any earlier than you have to be.)

5. **Set Alarmy to turn off when you take a picture of your routine.** That way, you’re guaranteed to be looking at exactly what you have to do once you’re up.

6. **Follow the written routine and don’t do anything else.** I’m just gonna do my 11 steps, that’s it. No watering plants, no trimming my nails, no organizing the linen closet. Each step leads to the next and then I’m out the door.

I know it’s probably disingenuous to share this before I’ve even tried it, but I’m really excited about this plan and thought it might help. :)

**Tl;dr:** write morning routine, Alarmy app with picture of it, refer back to the list to stay on task Something I do is just sleep in my clothes and minimal makeup, wake up right when I need to leave, if I possibly can 10 minutes before, just brush teeth and go. I used to do this for work, and I always do it when I have an early flight! I have this problem too. I've found that for me, the best way to limit this is by **physically getting up out of bed** when my first alarm goes off (crazy difficult to do, honestly, that snooze button is so beautiful). Then I get ready immediately and jump right back into bed. So I wake up with my first alarm an hour before I need to leave, take 10 minutes to get ready, around 5 to get dressed, and then I lay back down and sleep/chill with my extra 45ish minutes. Make sure you set a second alarm for when you actually need to leave, or you'll miss it and be late even though you were fully ready to go. It happens.

I basically just postpone pressing snooze until I'm finished getting ready. I seriously tell myself every morning, "just get ready and then you can go back to sleep". I've found that this works much better for me than getting up and ready right before I need to leave.  Set every clock in house 15 minutes ahead.  I'm not diagnosed and am just realizing that I likely have ADHD. I really struggled with getting to class back in school and could never figure out why that was. It was so bad that I would plan to get places an hour early just in case or that if schedule back to back things so that I had no time to do anything except go from point A to point B without thinking. 

As an adult, I managed getting to work only because I would be homeless without a paycheck and because I've gravitated towards a career where I have some flexibility with my arrival time. I used to support myself doing project based work from home type stuff too, which helped. 

I have to set a ton of alarms so that I stay on top of what time it is as I'm getting ready. Sometimes this means setting an alarm with reminders like "don't forget phone" and "get on train now." I try to remember to pack up the night before but I can almost never get that together without misplacing something. I'm working on always storing my essentials in my work bag so that even if I forget something important like my phone or wallet, I can still get to work and figure out how to get back home later. But I also have backup plans in place for if I forget my keys or don't have my metro card. It took a lot of trial and error, but I found things that help me get by.  This is one of the few times anxiety helps me. I'm so anxious about being late, that I'm always way too early for everything. I'm always afraid that something might delay me and cause me to be late so I always factor in time for a small delay. Like I get to work 30 min early just in case there's bad traffic one morning.

Don't try to plan to be on time, try planning on being early. Deliberately early. That way you switch your mentality from the bare minimum amount of time needed to be on time, to overestimating how long things take. I dunno, thats how I see it. If I tried to be exactly on time for everything, I'd constantly be 5 minutes late for giving myself too little time. But by always trying to be early, I tend to give myself too much time even. I know I'm bad at estimating times, so I just make sure that my wrong estimations are over, not under. Alarmy’s great! The only thing that got me used to waking up on time though you’ll feel like smashing your phone.  I have alarmy go off when I need to leave, and it will only turn off with a picture of my steering wheel. I've only been late once in the last month, and only by one minute!
