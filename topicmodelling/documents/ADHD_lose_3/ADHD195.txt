How worth it was CBT for you? Especially in goal setting, time management etc.  Very worth it. I thankfully have nice insurance so my copay is low and I have unlimited visits. The first key is finding a therapist you get along with and someone who is familiar to ADHD.

I think one of the greatest benefits is, we often have not so healthy coping mechanisms to get through the day. CBT can help replace those with healthier ways to cope. For me it also helped with my anxiety, my struggling with my education, and gave me the push to try medications. 

They’ll likely also teach you time management skills. My therapist recommended I keep a journal of sorts everywhere I go and it’s honestly helped immensely. I can keep track of things so much better than I could on my phone. 100% worth it!
It's made a huge difference in the 11 months I've been doing it. I'm in CBT now, I was told to do the same.  Therapist said I needed to buy a small journal and write down "anything I didn't want to forget". Hope it helps you Oh definitely. I love my book. I keep any important information in there. I work in e-commerce and I mapped out my entire website in it. Works great
