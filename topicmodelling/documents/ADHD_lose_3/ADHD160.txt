Setting a timer when doing a task. My newest attempt at trying to get control of myself is setting a timer to do things I don‚Äôt want to do. I did 30 days vegan and it was easier because I knew it ended in 30 days and now I‚Äôm back to meat and dairy but created the habit of cooking cleaner and more often. I‚Äôve also set a timer for the gym, doing some work/homework that I REALLY don‚Äôt want to do and also even to keep myself off of my phone. I‚Äôm finding that if I can stare at a countdown and tell myself ‚Äúonly 10 more minutes‚Äù I‚Äôm doing better with actually doing things and getting them done. 

I just wanted to share - I‚Äôm off the medication as the appetite suppressant is too much (I‚Äôm little and it‚Äôs easy for me to lose weight and HARD for me to gain) also the insomnia was getting annoying. I was diagnosed at 15 and am now 27 and noticed that this is REALLY helping creating some good discipline/habits/routine without meds. Has anyone ever tried anything like this? Or have any similar tactics? I have an apple watch, and its been a huge help with my adhd- in part because of the timer. I often set 5 or 10 minute times, and then just hit repeat while I'm doing an activity. It helps give me a sense if the passage of time. Plus I'm forced to look at watch and see time at regular intervals.

I also do something my adhd coach recommended. Put 2 or 3 things down on a piece of paper. Set timer for 15 minutes and a second for 1 hour. Work on the first item, and cross off when done. at th 15 minute timer, check that you're actually working on the list. At one hour (after 4 15 minute cycles), take a little break, reevaluate what you have done, what you need to do in the next hour, and put on a new post it note. But keep the old one, so you can see you have progressed.

This last one works well when I remember to do it. XD I'm more likely to forget than the watch because there is (slightly) more setup. Yes!!! I was off meds for 11 years. I tried to do the timer thing but it never worked. Now that I'm back in meds, I feel like I get way more accomplished, and I'm forced to take breaks when I use a timer. I've noticed when i take meds, I focus too much and just want to power through everything without slowing down to take a break to eat or go to the bathroom or whatever. So the timer allows me to break up my assignments and work time so I am able to force a 5 minute break in to drink water, go to the bathroom, text a friend back, etc. Yeah that‚Äôs why I went vegan. My immune system was shot and I was eating trash because it‚Äôs quick and convenient. It‚Äôs a lot but I lost 5lbs in 8 days I‚Äôm eating meat and dairy again but I it got me in a healthy eating habit which is good. I got through the junk withdraw lol  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7hyovm/a\_friend\_of\_mine\_learned\_about\_these\_in\_an\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7hyovm/a_friend_of_mine_learned_about_these_in_an_adhd/)

You may find this useful. I‚Äôm deff gonna have to try that. And live been trying to justify an Apple Watch and now I have a reason too üòÇ Dude forgetting to eat is a CONSTANT with those
Meds. I need to try different ones hopefully I can find one that works a little better for me. Do you feel like going vegan helped improve your ADHD symptoms or mood at all? Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. The timer is super easy to setup. I no longer have burnt vessels when I cook.  My Apple Watch is super helpful for my adhd. I seriously think everyone with adhd should have one. I see potential for watch apps to help those of us with adhd too. But I need time and energy to do something with those ideas!!!

 But I‚Äôve had to get better about turning off various notifications. Even if I don‚Äôt look at my watch, that small ping and vibrate on my wrist is enough to pull my focus away.  It really is!! The other day I worked my ass off doing stuff for like 9 or 10 hours straight. Didn't eat once. Then I came home fell asleep for a little bit, woke up, and I felt like my stomach was trying to eat me.  I rely on alexa for cooking. Love/hate that bitch so much Omg right! Once it wears off it feels like you‚Äôre insides are attacking themselves for food üòÇ so hungry!! Put me in a bad habit of stuffing my face in the middle of the night  Yup! I feel that. I dont really stuff my face, but I do eat a bit. When I'm off meds, I have a really hard time controlling how much or how often I eat. So it ended up being overeating, which means I'm now overweight. However, now that I'm on meds, I either forget to eat or my appetite is tiny. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I need to lose like 50lbs or so. It just drives me nuts bc I find myself eating things that aren't nutritional at all, if I remember to eat something.
