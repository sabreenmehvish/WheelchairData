Never forget another bright idea when you're out Use voice memos on your phone. I tried a few apps. Right now on Android I use "secret Voice Recorder HD".  Tap the power button three times, remind yourself to buy a hook to hang your glasses so you never lose them again, and push three times to end.

To make them easier to access and process, I then use another app to sync them to my  computer. Once a day, an alarm goes off reminding me to process them, usually into some other list like groceries or tasks. Some are more journal-y in nature, some are literally secret Voice recordings because I know I'll forget 99% of the important info my new boss just gave me... (Check your local laws on this one!)

I do some of my best thinking when driving or working with my hands, and there's no other system that has worked for me in those kind of situations. I've been using this system for at least a year so it's outlasted most others for me. Hope it helps you! Pressing the power button 3 times on my phone activates SOS mode...
