Tricks and tips for combatting lost keys/forgetting keys? This past month I have been horrendously locking myself out, locking my partner out, and now have finally lost my keys. I have been leaving for work really stressed, not to mention I am off my medication. I try to keep my keys in the same place but I forget. I really want to nip this in the butt because it is impacting the most important person in my life. Any ideas?

EDIT I have a carabiner that I use religiously and I try to follow the keep everything in one place method, but when I get home sometimes I forget. I also have a bright pink sign on the door reminding me to check for keys. I have never really done this since I was a kid, but this past month it has been haunting me. I just placed a hook on the door to hang my keys. Hopefully this will help.  I have a hook downstairs, by the door, where I promise to keep my keys every single time. 

Sometimes I put them up, but most of the time I don't. A lot of times I'll see them upstairs, by my bed and think "shit, I should go hang those up." But I don't. 

Then I realized, why do I need one key hook? I put a hook up by my bed. Now, I can put my keys in one of two places. If I head straight upstairs, I'll put my key on the (very visible) hook. If I loiter downstairs for awhile, I'll put my key on the hook down there. If I had a bigger apartment, I would put up more hooks. It works surprisingly well, and it takes almost no time to check both hooks. 


TLDR: Use multiple key hooks. Carribeaner.

Keep your keys on your belt/purse handle and you will never forget em.
It may be annoying if they clank around, but it keeps you from forgetting them. I bought a key finder http://www.findonefindall.com (fofa) and use one on my key (it is a key fob) and one tucked into my wallet (flat shaped). They've saved my bacon several times. Seriously - get some! [deleted] Do you find that you seem to misplace them in the same area each time? You might just need to designate a new spot that works better for you.  

I used to try to remember to keep my keys on a hook to the right of the door, but I always "forgot" and they ended up in a chair, on the floor, or on the piano - but always to the left of the door.  I put a little end table immediately left of the front door, and now I just drop my keys there.  I haven't had any issues since. I've tried the whole "put in same place" bit but it never worked for me...even on medication.  The solution that worked for me was to attach a coin purse to it with my bank cards, license, loose bills etc.  I was worried that I would end up losing other very important items in ADDITION to my keys but it actually made my keys MORE important and therefore I was more conscious of where I placed them.  Because I often misplaced my wallet as well it meant that I would find all my misplaced items in one spot.  Lastly, because I still misplace these items from time to time I started noticing a pattern of where I misplaced them.  If I can't find them I usually check 4 or so places and they're always there! Have a hook right by the door. I know you said you forget to put them in the same place, but I had the same problem. Unfortunately, I just had to build the habit. I was really lucky that I lived with a landlord who just thought it was funny when she had to let me in.

Some neon post-it notes would probably help - I had one at the bottom of my stairs and on my door, which said "keys, cell, wallet."  Every time I saw it, I checked my pockets.

And finally, I built the habit of locking my deadbolt every time I left the house, which can't be done without having your keys with you. This one helped me more than anything. I still panic halfway through the day and think I forgot my keys, but then I remember oh yeah, the door's closed, which means I have them. (Or the other way around - sometimes I think I forgot to lock the door, but since I know I have my keys, I know it's locked.) I always put my keys and phone (and whatever else I might need) in a specific place (or in my bag that I bring with me). Then I check this place before I leave home. It took some time to build the habit, but I haven't forgotten them in ages. Consistency.  I leave mine in the same bowl by my desk and forced my self to get into the routine of checking for keys, phone, and wallet every time I am leaving a place.  Not really a tip, but make it a habit and it gets easier. I definitely agree with the ideas like multiple key hooks. For me, the point has been having a limited number of designed 'places', that are *easily* accessible/where you tend to be, and making sure you always keep it there.

At my current rental, I make a point of always sticking it inside my pen holder or on the table in front of my printer. Both are near places I usually set my things down at, or settle into.  I don't allow myself to put it down until it's one of the two places.  After a while, it becomes a habit.

Before, when I didn't have designed places at other rentals, I would constantly lose them, behind my bed, under my desk, on the bathroom counter, in the kitchen, etc etc, and it got kind of ridiculous where I'd end of finding them.  I'd miss class, miss exams, lock myself out most days of the week, etc. It was very stressful, but the good news is it's a fix-able stress once you get a good habit down.

For my iPhone, after losing two in less than a week, I had to buy two of [these lanyards](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q46RDW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00) and tie one of the cords to my backpack/purse, and one near my charger at home.  When I'm out, I attach my phone to the cord to my backpack/purse, and when I'm home, I attach it to my charger.  It really helps.  Maybe you can use this idea for your keys? I just leave them in my pocket and never take them out. If it's too bulky, take off the keys you don't use every day and any key chain chotchkies. It's easier for me to remember the special occasion when I'll need a certain key rather than where I've put them on a daily basis.   If you have a problem with forgetting things, you need to create a ritual that makes it hard to forget. 

Here is my solution for keys and anything else that will be in my pockets when I am out. My keys, wallet, and money stay in my pockets all day and remain there until the next day when I put on a fresh pair of pants. Then I move my stuff from the old pair to the new pair. 

I would never consider laying my keys or wallet down if I was not going to pick them right back up again. They HAVE to be in my pocket or I will not know where they are. This is also why I rarely let anyone else drive my car. It isn't that I mind them driving it, it's that i don't trust them to leave my keys in a place where I will find them. 

I also pat myself down before I walk out of the house. If the pocket holding my wallet or keys feels empty, then I have forgotten something and I refuse go out the door until I find it. I presume that the door is going to spring shut and I WILL be locked out if I don't have my keys. So I refuse to go through the doorway until I am certain I have them. I do this even if everyone going with me has keys too. I'm really bad about remembering when I've put my keys, so I've just tried to drill myself through repetition to hang them on the hook on my desk. Don't always succeed but since when I come in, the first place I go to is my desk, even if they're not on the hook they at least make it to the floor by the desk. Close enough to find them. My only problem is when my boyfriend moves my car and sets my keys down (on the counter, or his desk, or on my bedside table) that I have real problems these days. Slowly drilling into him that keys must be at my desk or I can't find them. We're getting there XD I have a rule I acquired at my last job.  Keys are either in my hand or in my pocket.  Never anywhere else.  Even at bed time (they're in my pocket then). I have this thing here: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=key+pete

It's a magnetic key holder in the shape of a person.  It pops out to you when you walk in the room so you remember to put your keys there. Put them in your shoes when your at home. It's so absurd you might make it into a routine. 

When your out and about use a lanyard, it's hard to lose something when it's tied to you. I attach what i think I'll forget to something I won't. I never forget my phone, so my phone and wallet are stacked on top of eachother when I go to bed. I tend to forget my security pass for work, so I attach it to my car keys, which I can't leave for work without. Make your keys/key ring big and conspicuous. Mine are heavy but because I can feel the weight in my bag/pockets I know I have them. Put them in the same place every. damn. time.

I live in a 4 story condo building, so I use my keys to get into the building and into the condo. Right after my closet, there's a table/cupboard thing that my keys go on every single time I come in the door. If they don't, they're still in my pocket because I pop in and right back out. Do you have a reliable friend or family member that lives close by or a neighbor you trust that you can give a spare set to? I have done this my entire adult life.

I have never outright lost my entire set of keys, but even on medication, I misplace my keys and cell phone at home or at work a lot. (And yes, I do have a hook.) Sometimes I get interrupted in the middle of my getting home routine and don't put them where they go. 

And at least one time that I can remember I had to separate my car keys from my house keys during the day and got all the way home only to discover I had left my house keys at work. And that was on my medication. It sucks monumentally.

Anyway, I do this not just because I know I am capable of losing keys and I don't want to pay a locksmith. I do it because if something I couldn't anticipate happened and I couldn't get my keys back (dropping them over a pier during a day at the beach? car wreck? mugging? tornado? wrinkle in space-time? who knows?) at least I know that I have a set of keys located in a trustworthy, remote, but still relatively accessible location. My keys are on a small carabiner, which I clip onto my belt loop or strap of whatever I'm carrying. I have gotten into the habit of doing the Cellphone, wallet, keys check whenever I am moving locations. One pair of pants + keys attached to them = success. Even with that I always have to check if they are in my pocket before I close the door. My strategy is simply to do nothing at all with my keys. When I come home it's a habit to put the keys back in my jeans pocket - and I usually wear the same pair of jeans several days in a row.  I generally have to get dressed before I leave the house, and getting dressed finds my keys for me. If I need to find them and am not wearing jeans, I go looking in the pockets of yesterday's clothing. It's also easy to check I have them going out of the door because there's either a lump in my pocket or not. Works best if you don't have a ton of stuff on your keyring.

Any habit where they're attached to any item you can't walk out of the door without would work, I suppose. 

Another solution I had for a while when I was living in a dorm (wasn't always dressed leaving my room e.g. for showers, but only had a single key-card to keep track of) was a lanyard around my neck that I literally almost never took off - I slept with it in, etc. Funny... Reading through this I thought I had it all figured since I hang my keys on a hook right by the door. However, I always lose my wallet. Phone sometimes but it is often in my pocket. Get a lanyard, and keep your keys on it. It helps me a TON because it's a lot harder to lose a long lanyard than it is a single key. I have a real problem with losing things that I set down, so I have to always be aware of where certain things are. To make that easier, I always keep them on my person, regardless of whether I think I need them or not. I always have my wallet, keys, phone, itouch, and glasses on my person nomatter what, even if it's just going downstairs for a drink. If I willingly leave one behind even once, I'll forget it several times after that. 

But back to keys, even if I forget to put the keys back in my pocket, the lanyard is MUCH easier to spot than a single key. I'd recommend getting a color that isn't common in your house/wardrobe. Makes it easier to look for. [deleted] 1. Hang a hook on the door, and make sure to always check you hang it up when you get in, and **check you have your keys before you close the door on your way out!**

2. Why are you off medication?

3. Carabiner clip to your keyring, which then clips on to some piece of clothing on you. Or, some wrist or neck strap. 

4. Make and have backup sets of keys in your car, in your work desk, etc. 

5. **Switch to a numeric doorlock.** Then you never have to worry about keys again, and your partner will not get locked the fuck out.  Key lariat, a short one, so that you can wrap them around your wrist, like the handle of a soft dog leash, and when you get in, hang around the doorknob, so you remember them as you leave. : )

* EDIT I also have a carabiner on mine, so I can hook them to a bag or belt. I actually do that for both my keys and my glasses. My keys are on a carabinder I can hook to myself (I've learned, if it's not hooked to me somehow, I'll lose it!) I found that I hook it on my white plastic shelf thing I use as kind of a landing point for random crap I take home with me. I also have, by my bed on the nightstand and on my kichen table. Shoes are like, under the desk, under the kitchen table or by my dad's shoes. My glasses are by the computer, by the bed, by the bathroom, etc. If I don't put them there they're essentially lost.  That's a good idea. 

My wife placed a thing that has a few hooks and a mail slot by the front door and I've gotten better about using it but sometimes I walk straight up to the bedroom or downstairs to my office because I'm just so focused on what I'm doing I totally space out. I might adopt this multi-hook plan
 I keep mine on one I just usually leave them attached to my pants from the night before or go to the gym without something to hook them to... so I am starting with the hook method on the door too!
 That's where I keep mine! Always clipped to my purse. The added benefit is that the carbiner makes the keys "bigger" so they're a little harder to lose if I forget to clip onto my purse when I get home (which tends to happen since my ritual when I get home is "toss everything in my hands onto the floor"). Couldn't agree more! i just keep all my keys on a carribeaner on a belt loop. then when i am frantically searching for my keys in the morning, i just check the pants that i was wearing yesterday! Oh, thank you, this is great! This is one of those things I only think about when I've misplaced my keys or cell phone, so I've never looked to see if it actually existed. 

This will work nicely until someone mass markets the biometric voice activated version so my lost stuff actually beeps at me when I call for it out loud. File that one under "things that I will never invent, but someone should." the bowl eventualy becomes receipts, pennies and gum wrappers I just implemented the hook system. I already use a keep everything in one spot system and have a carabiner that clips my keys to me-- but if I go to the gym it is not really helpful. I am off my medication because right now it is too expensive for me since I am in between jobs and work at a restaurant.  Does your gym have a locker system? Use the hell out of that. If not, make sure to have clothes that will keep your keys, and maybe leave your house keys in the car and just take your car key to the gym, on a wrist thing or neck band.
