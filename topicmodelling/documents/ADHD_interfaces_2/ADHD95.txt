Frustrated with reading online I have a really hard time focusing while reading anyway. I almost always have to reread things multiple times to comprehend the information. I've come to the realization that it's almost impossible for me to read online and even scroll through Reddit on the app all because of flippin' gifs, pictures, and videos too close to the text. 

Does anyone else share this frustration? Is there any way to make these things disappear or not pop up and auto play? It's such a small thing but I'm tired of having to block it out with my hand/give up reading something out of frustration. 

Edit: I'm just trying to read for fun. It wouldn't make sense for me to print out everything I try to read from my phone/computer. Does anyone know of an app to block out images/video or have any other tricks to have just text show up on a page?

Edit 2: Thanks for the gold! Was not expecting that! For grad school, I gave up trying to read online and bought a cheap laser printer.  I printed out every reading so that I could focus on it without the temptation of opening up a new browser tab every 5 seconds.  I measured the stack of printed material for one of my courses, 16 inches of paper! Yep, I can't read online. I tend to print off my uni readings and attack them with a highlighter. But I've also started opening PDFs in Acrobat and highlighting them through that. I highlight way more than would be necessary for the average person, but it makes sure I stay focussed on the page and actually take on what I'm reading.  I know plenty of non-ADHD people who say they can't focus well reading online and always print out things.  I use W3M to do my browsing, no images!! So much better!!! I use origin ad block extension with Vivaldi browser. With origin you can manually block any elements the filters you select have missed. Combine that with Vivaldi having the option to toggle the browsers UI you can very quickly turn a busy, flashing page into a full screen window of plain text without leaving the browser.

Plan B is always print the webpage to pdf and open it in the PDF reader in reading mode. Thanks for the tip. I have 500 plus tabs open, and printing the articles might just be the thing to get that number down.  16 inches | 40.6 cm ^metric ^units ^bot ^| ^[feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=cannawen&subject=metric%20units%20bot&message=I%20think%20your%20bot%20is...%20%5BPlease%20include%20a%20link%20if%20you%20are%20reporting%20a%20bug%20about%20a%20specific%20comment!%5D) ^| ^[source](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot) ^| ^[stop](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=metric_units&subject=stop&message=If%20you%20would%20like%20to%20stop%20seeing%20this%20bot%27s%20comments%2C%20please%20send%20this%20private%20message%20with%20the%20subject%20%27stop%27.%20If%20you%20are%20a%20moderator%2C%20please%20go%20to%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FADHD%2Fabout%2Fbanned%2F) ^| ^v0.7.0 I'm just reading for fun. It would be kinda silly for me to print out a news article or my Facebook feed.
