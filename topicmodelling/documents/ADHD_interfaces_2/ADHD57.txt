Beeline Reader - A tool to help you concentrate when reading For Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/beelinereader/

What this tool does is apply a color gradient across text on websites to help you follow the text. [Here](http://thepsychreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-26-at-11.46.09-AM-710x575.png) is an example. [It's apparently backed up by research](http://thepsychreport.com/current-events/speed-reading-apps-open-research-questions/).

I feel it helps me pick text back up when looking for the next line down, but also generally when reading text. It has a somewhat iffy subscription model, but you can still use it in a limited capacity after the trial expires. It also doesn't work on all websites, and may slow down loading while it colors the text. I know it's been posted before, but for a long time it was not compatible with Firefox, so I figured I'd just post it. >I feel it helps me pick text back up when looking for the next line down

Woah never realized how often i do that...  like every line... shit. I'll read half a line then skip down a few, read half that line, look back at the first line, repeat. And also just skipping over chunks of sentences to basically just read the beginning and end of a sentence. Then I end up just having to reread it anyway. whyyyyy  Woah, it's kinda trippy how much easier that makes it. They need something like this for textbooks! Hi, BeeLine creator here! FYI, there's a bunch of different research now, which is summarized on the [BeeLine for education page](http://www.beelinereader.com/education). Also, not all of our tools are subscriptionâ€”our iOS app, which lets you read news and Kindle books (iPad only for that feature) are one-time purchases. 

We also have a completely free app called [Read Across The Aisle](http://www.readacrosstheaisle.com) that you can use to read news with BeeLine.

Perhaps most importantly, our tools are often free for people to use because their school or employer is required to purchase it for them as an accommodation. I am happy to help out with arranging this free access if you ever run into a wall: nick@[domain] It's easy to alter the code and reinstall it so that the trial never runs out.

Or you could just install any of the add CSS to website extensions like Stylebot and just add maybe 6 lines of CSS that does this automatically for any website. Don't have the CSS code on me but can probably get it upon request.
