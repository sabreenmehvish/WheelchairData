Highschool Student Help! Hello! I need some help guys. I am a junior in Highschool currently on track for either valedictorian or salutatorian in my school. (3.98 unweighted) This year has been a challenge, I’ve actually had to try this year, it was a wake up call. But I’m managing, I’ve noticed now that my AP US History class has a lot more reading assignments, that I’m not retaining the information like I used to. Reading is very hard for me to do, let alone retain what I read. Any school or life related tips would be a god send thanks!  Take notes - it really helps. One of the best ways of retaining information is to write it out. This is an extension of the take notes idea, but goes beyond it. Write your own outlines, your own descriptions of the events you are studying. Not only does this force you to engage with the material, but forces you to learn it well enough to write about it. [deleted] While reading presumably?  Are you Medicated or do you compensate with caffeine?  Yes.   [deleted] Any other tips? Anything would help  How has life changed since then? Is there any way you can form some sort of study group for this, where you make a point of meeting with others to discuss what you've read? Perhaps even being responsible for summarising specific sections of the text for the group? This way other people are depending on you and holding you accountable - I find I'm a bit more productive when I know others are relying on me!

Also, recording yourself reading the text aloud can be useful. Even if you're not taking it all in as you're reading, you can replay it in the background while you're doing other things. Some of the information is bound to trickle into your head!
