Very newly diagnosed with ADHD. How exactly is this supposed to work? Kinda long story about day one on medication and questions Hello friends, basically I'm in college I recently went and got tested and diagnosed with ADHD, my doc prescribed me an RX for 10 mg adderal 2x a day. But he said to play with the dosage to see what's right and what works (One tablet broken in half). One when I wake up one around lunch  After I picked up my RX I took half and a couple hours later my girlfriend suggested I take the other half so it would wear off around the time we normally go to bed. I figured I didn't want to argue  and took the other half after a couple minutes I fealt really good like a light bulb in my brain being tightened so it isn't  flickering. I was really super focused on what I was doing and in a great mood. Normally when nothing's going on or I'm studying my leg bounces when I'm siting down, napkins/papers get shredded, pens get flung across the room from spinning them, or I'll just zone out and reality slips away until someone knocks me back into focus (usually hitting me or calling get my name) all of that stopped. After studying my girlfriend gets out of class and we run to the store and for once I actually remembered everything we needed, where it all should be, and when checking out around what everything should cost normally I would have forgotten all of that. After that first day on medication I went with what the dr prescribed me half a pill at breakfast half at lunch. He said to see him after a week of that routine and we'd work from there. So after a week I wasn't able to make my appointment with him because I had a problem with my car so I got a ride the day before and he was kind enough to see me really quick between an appointment and basically see what was going on. I told him what happened and how when I took the 20 the first day how it worked pretty well and taking the 10 two times a day I don't feel is working at all. But I didn't really get a chance to fully explain everything as we had to be *really* quick so I was kinda rushed through and he gave me an RX to turn in when my adderal ran out  (school clinic isn't open over the winter break). So I'm now taking the 20 mg tablets of adderal and its never had the same effect as the first day I was on it and I'm not sure if it's really doing anything because I'm back to my old routine of zoning out or fidgeting my leg, getting distracted or whatever. What exactly is it supposed to be like so I know when I'm on the right dosage what should i look out for what kind of behaviors will stop what will improve why was the first day so different than every other, what should I avoid etc sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm not able to get in contact with my doc for another two weeks. Any help is appreciated 

Also I am not sure if this is relevant but I am noticing That for a while I was not getting tired and was eating less but lately appetite has been coming back slightly You are also going to be prone to posting fat walls of text on Reddit, so if you're worried about becoming too resistant to it too fast, clearly that's not a problem.  
  
I myself have only started Adderall recently, on the 10g twice a day, and won't be able to see the psychiatrist for two weeks (are you me?!?!?). What I've found is that no, the fidgeting doesn't really go away, and I don't expect it to, but there are perks to look out for that you can make use of. How would you say you are listening to people while on Adderall? Have you tried reading things you don't care that much about, maybe watching a dry movie?  
  
Maybe you're not going to notice more dramatic results until you increase your dosage (and I don't expect you'd notice anything at 5mg). When you say you're now on 20, do you mean 20 once a day or twice? 
  
 ive been taking 20 once a day the past week. I've been more talkative over like Reddit or text message. But I'll go try and learn about something new to see if it sticks. When it works is it a noticeable difference or what? I'm on 10 twice a day, which, as I understand it, gets into and out of your system faster than the more delayed one-a-day. When I take the first one, within 2-3 hours I am awake, alert, and much more capable and willing to have a conversation (on- and offline). My thoughts are more stable and I'm a bit more confident. It's still not always easy to stop procrastination (I have presents I need to wrap...) and I still get distracted and pace about the house, but it's much easier to return to what I was doing without having forgotten much.   
  
I haven't tried the one-a-day yet, though I think I want to, but its effects as they were described to me sound more gentle than the two-a-day, so maybe you need a higher dose to compensate, or maybe you are getting benefits without realising it.  
  
Effects I've seen:  
  
* Energy, wakefulness, general lack of fatigue  
* Motor mouth. I have much less of a censor. I am more prone to speaking, and speaking at length, out loud and in text.  
* Confidence, well-founded or otherwise. I can walk into the bank, and it doesn't bother me that I don't exactly know what the right words are for my issue. I don't feel bad about my ignorance, I just ask for help, and I get it (this is amazing). 
* Downside to the above: potential overconfidence. I am somewhat less patient with well-meaning advice that I have not asked for, when it contradicts what I have settled on. When I make up my mind, I don't appreciate further input.  
* Short-term memory. I can read a phone number, or what have you, walk to another room, and recite it confidently (this is amazing).  
* Blood pressure. Now I know why the therapist recorded mine before I started on Adderall. It's sporadic, and does not feel that big of a deal, but sometimes I get flushed in the face. This is massively exacerbated by the smallest amount of alcohol, so I guess I'm a teetotaller now.  
  
These are what I've noticed so far, and intend to mention to my psychiatrist, seeing about maybe an increase with a switch to one-a-day. Maybe it is just that you need more to see results. Some folks here I've seen are on 60mg, so that is an option. I think I'll try out up-ing the dosage than I'm more or less the same as before I just didn't want to go too over the top because I have no idea what an appropriate dose would be ill talk to the doc when I can also thanks for the info
