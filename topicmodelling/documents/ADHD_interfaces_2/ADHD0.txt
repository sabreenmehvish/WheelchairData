I'm not able to reatain information when reading things. I have recently come to the conclusion that majority of the time I read, or I should say attempt to read, I never retain information that I'm reading. For example today I have been trying to research a topic in java and came across a lesson about it on some forum. However when I attempt to read it I'll read maybe one sentence into it and be at a total loss of what I just read. Then I try over and over again and somehow as I'm reading it my mind just drifts and none of it sticks. It almost like I'm just phonetically sounding out the words in my head without paying attention to the meaning to them and I have no idea why I do that or how to get myself to focus. Idk if this is something that I myself have or something Any of you guys can relate to. Anyways I must ask for those who may relate with this; how do you cope? I recognize this, but not to the extend you describe it.

Anyway, meds are really helping me with this.
I remember sitting in the living room, reading something on my phone and thinking "Oh my god, I could actually summarize what I just read!", which was a new experience :D

In normal mode I can remember the general topic of a text, but struggle to retain the different topics or ideas presented. You might try a different aproach to reading. Passive reading is very hard to sustain if you have problems with focus:

- Skim through the text (read the title of subsection, figures, graphs, and any other thing that is salient at a first glance)

- Keep a notebook next to you and based on that first layer of reading write some topics about what you expect to find in the text and some short questions you expect the text will answer.

- Try to conect everything you read to those topics/questions. It should help with retention

If it more about learning code you should also consider:

- get a good IDE. The color coding and the hability to colapse/expand parts of the code is really usefull to switch between the general structure and the details of a piece of code. Keep writing the code as you go along (don't copy/paste it). If possible run it and try to understand how it works before you move along. Take notes as you read.  It keeps your attention focused and gives your hands something to do.  It takes longer than "just reading", sure- but not as long as having to re-read a passage six times.

Bonus, many people remember what they write down better as writing reinforces the memory.
