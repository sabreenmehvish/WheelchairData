personality traits or personality disorder? the INTP, inattentive ADD or OPCD riddle. I've read so much lately about personality types (I'm an INTP according to multiple tests) inattentive ADD, and OCPD that my head is spinning a bit! I've kept a note of areas of my life that I feel are the biggest problems, but the majority seem to be common traits of the INTP personality, as well as common symptoms of inattentive ADD and OCPD. Feels a bit like the case of the chicken or the egg.


I've kept a note of areas of my life I feel are most problematic. Any others here undecided whether they have a disorder or simply a high strung personality? I've asked to be referred to a specialist to discuss so hopefully I'll be able to get clarification.



**compulsive/addictive/hoarder**


addictive or compulsive personality - if doing something i want to be the best. decide i like rum then need to try all the rum to decide which is my favourite. same with restaurants/beer/takeaway/recipes/apps/tv shows/ films. keep lists for everything.

often hard at putting limits on alcohol/junk food once started.

information hoarding . get stuck spending weeks/months researching a topic. feel like i can’t move forward with something unless know it completely so will search and read as many blogs/articles/books on the subject as I can find as the knowledge may be useful in the future. Have trouble shutting off/shifting focus. Lose track of time and neglect myself (eating/drinking/exercising) and others. find people a hinderance and become irritable when others get in the way of my current obsession. look forward to them being gone so i can get back to it. want to know everything about subject immediately, feel like life running away from me because of it, to the detriment of other tasks needing done.


**overthink/ruminate/perseverate**


can find it difficult to make decisions no matter how trivial - choosing what to eat at restaurants, colour of paint for bedroom etc

focus too much on planning over doing. results in being overwhelmed and failure to act. low self esteem because of that. 

often told I think too much

had a period health anxiety where I convinced myself I had cancer/brain tumour/heart problems

sensitive to criticism/failure/rejection, dwell on it and hold grudges

often can’t get to sleep because thoughts racing

become lost in worries and trouble putting them aside


**focus/distraction**


easily distracted by both both internal thoughts and external events. go off on tangents. one thought leads to another, which i then pursue and get further from my initial task.

difficulty finishing a task before switching to something else - skip songs whilst playing, jump to end of blog posts/articles and often read backwards

have trouble staying focussed on mundane tasks, become tired and take breaks, end up taking forever to complete
often ask question then don’t listen / forget answer / get distracted by thinking what i want to say next so have to ask again.

more productive/focussed at night, stay up late because less distractions/easier to focus/more productive


**time keeping**


bad at timekeeping/time management - leave things to last minute, get lost in tasks, then often late
trouble adhering to deadlines - uni, work, put off cleaning until someone visiting, filing taxes, arriving late for meetings

find it very difficult to get started with tasks i’m not interested in


**trouble switching gears/inflexible**


persistent/stubborn - once put my mind to something difficult to let it go

find multitasking/switching gears difficult - all or nothing, prefer closure on one task before moving onto next. very linear.

if made plans find it hard getting over when things deviate from them


**perfectionism**


overly ambitious/overestimate capabilities which sets up for failure, then causes anxiety/overwhelm. all or nothing .


**memory/recall**


difficulty estimating passage of time when asked how long ago something occurred

tend to forget trivial/low-interest information - plots/characters name, names of people (though better with faces), lyrics, following recipes, phone numbers when jotting them down

prefer watching seasons of tv shows all in one go, rather than weekly - forget what has  happened inbetween weeks/seasons otherwise.

reliance on notes, lists, triggers/prompts (reminders and visual), routine/structure, associations, pro/con lists as coping mechanisms

quickly forget things - say in my head, “need to remember that”, then find within seconds forgot and need to make a conscious effort to bring it back into focus

when talking I often can trip over / muddle words - left/right, fork/spoon etc.  call people by wrong name that I’ve known for years. often can’t think of correct word/phrase. self-conscious with pronunciation, often forget even though checked in past.

need to re-read paragraphs a couple times a take notes to let it sink in, need to get people to repeat verbal instructions or preferably get it in writing.

prefer written communication over verbal - more articulate, follow written instructions better.


**relationships/emotions**


don’t feel as mature / grown up as others my age

difficulty maintaining eye contact, low confidence, low self-esteem

little interest in empty conversations/small talk. trouble keeping momentum in conversations that don’t serve a purpose or take to long to get to the point. often have to fake it to fit in.

awkward / quiet / reserved / withdrawn - avoided presentations at uni

often feel like i need to learn how to act human rather than like a robot - people ask how i am, reply, but  don’t ask how they are. learning to be more mindful others whereas it seems to come naturally to others.

small group of friends

react internally more than externally to events

show a lot of attention when first start dating, then dwindles as relationship goes on

neglect others needs when consumed with learning about latest interests

emotional, but rarely show it / have trouble expressing it. can appear emotionless. very rarely return “i love you” when others say it and when I do feel like I’m saying it because it’s expected. tend to bottle emotions up. 

find it easier to express emotions through text/sms/messenger

enjoy alone time


**fidgety**


nail biting/picking, humming/whistling, playing with hair, chewing pens, toilet/water breaks at work, tapping feet - adult manifestation of hyperactivity


**effects of stimulants**


alcohol - more focussed/motivated/calm/productive/sociable whilst drinking. don’t overthink as much. often got good chunk of essays written, work done when drunk. better scores on brain training after alcohol. though very anxious next day if drink too much - ended up in a&e with panic attack a couple times.

coffee - too strong can make me jittery, buzzy, unfocused


**other**


Poor executive functioning explains why a person with ADD can waste hours on a minor task or get distracted by the slightest interruption.

fatigue

often feel build up on left side of head

more interested in pursuing passion than money

work after hours/longer hours/through night/weekends to catch up/keep up - both uni and work - often feel a bit like a swan - appearing to glide along, but paddling hard under the water to keep afloat

hold pencil awkward

slow with written work

attention wandering

problems with concentration

unsure how to deal with people and their reactions

often daydreams

prefers alone time in reading corner If you feel you are struggling with these things then see a psychologist or psychiatrist.

Myers-Briggs is a garbage personality test. The big 5 personality test is much better (OCEAN).  Hi! Nice to read your post. A gazillion things just popped in to my head reading this, but I'll try to keep it short. Just saying, that I recognize more or less all of these things in myself too. (Though more of an ENTPish way. I love presentations and I'm doing at least fifteen things at once).

I noticed, that you wrote up about most of the things in a very negative way. But do you think there are also positive sides to this traits/disorders? Have you learned to use them in a good way? I'm just here to agree with what throwaway[holyshitthatsalotofnumbers] said. See a psychologist/psychiatrist.

Personality disorders are tricky to diagnose, because the symptoms are things most people do. It becomes a disorder when it has a certain impact on your life. It's hard to judge what that line is. That's what professionals are for. 

You may also want to consider seeing a psychotherapist. They don't generally diagnose, but in my opinion are good for personality stuff. Sounds a lot like ADHD-PI to me. I have it aswell. I am also very perfectionistic (probably because of my intelligence and my family's intelligence) which makes things interesting. At times I think I have a serious psychiatric disorder but after a few hours I realise I just got caught up in a thought loop (thanks ADHD).

Keep in mind: nobody is normal. People with ADHD tend to be worse at self reflection than other people and we often have low self-esteem. In my case this causes a lot of confusion.

You should definitely get yourself tested to find out what's really wrong. I like how some of the things described here aren't directly related to adhd, yet they're still indicators of someone having it. I'd love to see psychiatrists use lists like these to more accurately diagnose someone. Reading that post I was wondering if I had posted it in my sleep or something. I'm pi and can attest to the seek out testing
