LPT: Use Simple English Wikipedia!!! If you’re like me and hate reading long paragraphs/texts to learn new information, and get easily overwhelmed from it, use simple English Wikipedia!!

It’s all the same information, but in a more condensed form and easy to read style. I believe the purpose for it is for people new to the English language, but I’ve been able to learn so much more information now because I don’t have to read thousands and thousands of paragraphs!
