How can I overcome the challenges of having ADHD and being in a relationship? Before I start I do want to mention that while I have adhd and it has its impact on my relationships, I am not using it as an excuse for what actions or inactions that I commit. What I do is still really up to me, and when I lose my grip on myself, it's still me who is doing it.

I recently had a serious fight with my S/O (who probably won't be my s/o due to the other numerous fights that we've had because of me) and when she wanted to talk about the things and the why's of what I've done, I could never give her a solid answer. Even if they were the same problems causing the same fights. Nothing really changed with me. This is not to say that I haven't tried putting in some effort. I've researched more and more about adhd I'm relationships; tried keeping them in mind when my emotions and thoughts start to race; talking to my therapist about them and admitting to them that I was wrong/the cause; keeping up with my medicine everyday. Yet, nothing really does seem to change with me. I forget why X happens; what the solution is and what we wanted after a fight despite her having told me numerous times what she wanted; what I tell myself daily to avoid negative confrontation; being honest as I can be (when my thoughts can actually form into something coherent) about my feelings and attempting to communicate more before they explode - which has happened a few times - and trying to be aware of them; not understanding what she is asking of me or what her point would be in the moment; etc, etc.

I'm clearly not the best at this sort of thing. Whether or not we do stay together (which I doubt), I can at least use advice for the future. Especially because, as I have said, the issues that develop do come from me. I mean that without wanting to be pitied or sympathized/empathized with. It's just the truth and I want to do something about it. Either being hit with a bat or not, it doesn't matter how it's given to me.

Tl;Dr I suck at relationships because I don't have a good handle of my adhd. Besides the obvious, what else can I do about it? The only way I’ve been able to have healthy relationships is with 100% honesty about all things even when they might be hurtful or when I’m being unfair.  1. Explain your deficits to her as clearly as possible. So she can imagine your side. Keep trying to understand yourself better.
2. Ask her to give you a list of the top three things you do that are likely to hurt/drive her crazy. Ask her to give you early warning when she sees something going wrong but there's still time.
3. Take her word for it when she describes something bad you did.
4. When you guys need to talk, use self-knowledge to make it work better. I mean if you can listen better while walking, or in the car, or sitting side by side not face to face.

A system like this won't make everything perfect but it helps and it also shows her your sincerity about wanting things to work. Hi friend!

I had several serious girlfriends in my high school / early college days. Each relationship ended like this:

* 1) "You're great, but not enough effort"
* 2) "You're fun as hell, but not enough effort"
* 3) "lol...not enough effort"
* etc, etc, etc, etc

The thing is, it wasn't that I **didn't** put the effort in, it was that I put the *wrong** *kind* of effort in.

Your S.O. seems unable to make any sense of you because, like you said, **you** can't make sense of you. For your own sake, take some time for yourself and (don't laugh) **Meditate**. It's time to be brutally honest w/ yourself in a way that you've never done before. 

I was able to remove some huge personal hurdles and insecurities through meditation and simply being honest w/ myself. Once it clicked **why** I wasn't putting effort into my life, I could then work toward putting true effort into my life. 

Now I have a bigger focus in life and I learned how to get to the "solid answers."
 
I realize it doesn't address your relationship problem exactly (would need examples of why you're fighting).

Does this make sense?


TL;DR -- Have a brutal heart to heart w/ yourself in an effort to foment a positive outcome. 
 Hey, me too! HowToADHD's guide to relationships has been helpful, but besides that what works for me is keeping note of all those things. For things that are serious, I ask my partner to send it to me on text somewhere. I add events to my calendar when they're mentioned by people I love. Not my main calendar, but one for friends and family. If they mention wanting something I put it down in a list for Christmas/birthday gifts. Basically, I work around my inability to remember things by documenting everything I can. I know it's dorky to have a reminder set for the end of your SO's shift to text them but it makes them feel loved and that's what's important. Thanks for the input. What you said does make sense. However, the process on doing it might be different for me. I have done meditation in the past per my therapist and counselors, but it usually hasn't worked for me. Though you are right that I might need time to develop and understand myself more. Especially because I was only diagnosed with adhd in April of this year (among others), and I met my so a month after that. It'll probably be hard to keep up with it at first, but I am willing to try out what you said. Appreciate it. Absolutely! Everyone is different. What worked for me may not work for you.
