My husband has ADD but he struggles to understand my ADHD. I'm not sure how to get him to understand or fix myself. I was originally diagnosed at 7, put on Adderall then taken off because I hated it. My parents didn't pursue it any further. I was rediagnosed at 20 and put on Strattera, which didn't work for me. I was then put on Adderall again (for college) and I went off it again because I didn't like it. Basically I only know coping mechanisms that I figured out on my own and very little interest in medication. 

This is seriously causing problems in our marriage. Some things that I do that he can't understand are:

-Needing to do things when I'm feeling hyper. Normally I can get away with fidgeting or keeping my brain extra involved (which also bothers him) but some days I need something more like going on a walk. I don't feel this very often, but when I do I'm basically crawling out of my skin if I have to stay in just one room. He is more of a roll around and do nothing sort of person. Today for instance he just wanted to cuddle but I have been very hyper today and just wanted to go on a walk. I sat and cuddled for 20 minutes, but it bothered him that I seemed like I was just on edge for it to end (to be fair I was). I don't know how to say it other than "I need to go for a walk" or "I can't sit still today" and he doesn't understand the feeling or necessity.

-My intense reading. I'm not actually sure if this from my ADHD but I'm pretty sure it is. If I'm reading something, everything else disappears. I don't really hear anything else unless it is incredibly intrusive. It is like that for anything I'm concentrating completely on, but I cannot read unless I am completely concentrating on it, so it happens every time I read something (whether it is a text message or a book). He finds it irritating that he has to say my name multiple times to get my attention, that if I go back to reading he has to start the process over (like if I'm in a texting conversation that is in an active group text so there aren't pauses between texts), and that he sometimes can't tell when I'm listening or not (sometimes I respond with "hmm" but I actually haven't processed anything. I don't know why I do it, it's almost instinctive). To make things worse when I am pulled out of intense concentration it is INCREDIBLY frustrating for me. I don't know why, but it drives me up a wall. I have tried telling him if he needs me to stop reading, then interact with him till completion, then I can continue reading, that would help with my frustration and his. But he doesn't want that. He wants to be able to talk while I read whenever and have me instantly be able to join.

-I sometimes cut people off in conversations. This gets significantly worse on days I am hyper. I have been actively trying to control this since childhood. I had friends point out to me in middle school that I cut them off a lot, and it was their least favorite thing about me. I even had someone say it made them very angry with me. I have been trying to control it ever since. I am generally ok about it, and do things like tap my foot, or tap my ring finger to my palm to help control it. I don't know why that helps, but it does. My husband says thing like "oh, you don't care" when I cut him off by accident. I reassure him that I do and encourage him to keep going, but on my very hyper days sometimes I cut him off again. He gets very upset and tells me he feels like I don't care about him. I've tried telling him I do care, and it's not personal but he doesn't get it.



Today we got into a fight because these things are making him feel unloved. I am doing the best I can to control these things, and it makes me feel frustrated that I cannot do any better. It also hurts because I feel like he doesn't consider how I feel in these situations and is treating me like I am consciously making these choices. How do I either cope better or get him to understand better?


Also I'm sorry if my formatting is terrible or if I'm doing this wrong. I have never been here before and I didn't know where to go. We just had a big fight about it, and I feel like I flashed back to my dad screaming at me at the kitchen table to just sit at the kitchen table and do my work...and me just not able to focus and do it. I'm trying so hard and I don't know how to fix what's wrong with me. I would suggest trying to find a therapist that specializes in ADHD and is willing to do couples therapy.  Communication can be hard even without neurological disorders in the mix.  A therapist will have strategies to facilitate communication and will hopefully understand roadblocks to communication that ADHD poses, and be able to help you two navigate around those. Wow, you two sound exactly like my parents, they fit the descriptions you've been giving.


Does your husband not understand or is his emotional reaction in a way which makes him react as he does?

-

**Eg.**


**1:**
You accidentally interrupt him and he reacts by stating that you don't care. You're telling him that you do and explain that it's not intentional. He knows about ADHD as well. Does he not understand or is his emotional response that strong that it makes him upset and impulsively states that you don't care. Does he have another disorder comorbid with ADHD?

-

**2:**
Him trying to get your attention when you're focused. I understand how he feels when he's trying to get your attention but this is not your fault. This is something that he has to accept. Perhaps it's his own issues that are the real reason for him getting upset.


- **Retaining info;** Difficulties keeping information in his mind, making him want to speak as soon as possible.


- **Mental fatigue;** wanting it to go "fast", hard to hold patience. Feeling of tiredness. 


- **Emotional dysregulation;** different emotional reactions, common is a strong feeling of rejection *(see: RSD)*.

***YOUR POWERFUL FOCUS***

You have a very strong ability to concentrate, however, how it has taken its form is almost like a coping mechanism. Difficulties concentrating leading to one having to shut off external stimuli to be able to concentrate. I do have this problem and one of my parents have this problem to an extreme level.

Honestly, I'd prefer both of my parents to seek treatment and try to find suiting meds. Not for my sake, for their. I do see their *problems* and how it affects them not only as individuals but as couples. I believe medication could possibly help them a lot.  Working out, meditation,and getting 8 hours of sleep have been game changers for me. Try getting into a gym or running routine. We are different people, but for me walking is only a temporary fix when I feel hyper. 30 minutes to an hour of intense exercise per day keeps my ADHD mostly in check for the rest of the day! This can be running, callistenics, or lifting weights. Sleep is great because I find my ability to control my focus is a lot worse with little sleep. Finally, meditation is awesome! Practicing it has taught me how to control my hyper and inatentive symptoms when i feel them coming on. Finally don’t expect to ever perfectly control your symptoms and act like a “normal person” ADHD often causes me to struggle with finishing a set goal, but it has also lead me to awesome creative ideas and ones that my friends, family l, or aqquaintences never thought of. If you feel that intense hyper energy coming around try channeling it into something you are interested in. I for example love to write and play music, when I get that hyper feeling I like to get out my guitar and write some music for 20. Learn to control your symptoms, but also learn to love yourself for what you naturally are and feel. Its all a balance. Life is all about balance... From reading this it partly sounds a bit like he's just the partner who's most vocal with complaints.

Like with the cuddling example. If you had said *it really makes me feel unloved that you want to cuddle while I need to get rid of my built up energy to be comfortable with sitting still again*, you'd also have a point and now suddenly you're no longer the partner 'doing something wrong'. 

With the reading *it really makes me feel unloved that you know you break my concentration when talking to me when I'm focused and can't give me 5 minutes before starting a conversation*. 

Not that someone *needs* to be right, but right now it seems you're taking the blame for everything, whilst in reality those are things you need to find solutions for together.  Hey, just thought I'd give my 2 cents... as I was in a marriage similar to this. Keyword: *was*.

He needs to start respecting your needs as equal to his own. Right now he's making you feel terrible, and he thinks he's justified in that, when in fact he is actually unfairly taking his own anger issues out on you.

Read what futurecrazycatlady said on this thread - she is spot on. If my ex had followed her advice, maybe we wouldn't have had a divorce, but who knows, some men just cannot get over their own ego and constant need to be 'the one who's right'.

have you got kids? As if you haven't you're much more free to walk. I stayed for a long time mainly because we have a child together. Now we're fighting everything out in court, but at least I can live in a home where I get to relax and be myself, and enjoy the company of my partner who understands and accepts my quirks instead of taking them as personal insults that would warrant him 'telling me off' constantly.

Yeah, you pretty much need to seek help in some form, this situation is emotionally unhealthy for you. If your husband is open for seeking help also, then this marriage might actually be saved. But right now he is acting like an arse and you're agreeing with him, putting yourself down about things that frankly aren't your fault. 

And he should stop interrupting you when you're reading -- that is a form of torture!

 Tell this jackass husband to stop being a little cry baby when you read and get over his attention seeking issues. You should set boundaries. When you read only two things may intervene.

Natural cataclysms and the Coming of Your Favorite Deity. 

Bind one hour to reading. Then break for his oh so important issues that could not wait. From you it would be fair to read not when he needs to discuss dinner plans or whatever mutual stuff you have to do. 

If need be  - and in many marriages with disorders this must be the case - make of your time together a bloody bus route schedule. You need structure anyway. So plan the days. 

You get your Reading Time, he gets his Talk Hour. And then there are the Shared Events. It sounds like a prison, but a prison it must be because prisons free you up. You are lived by the regime. You cannot fight it, so why fight it? Go along with it and focus the mind on inner life.

It is bad it has to be this way perhaps. But a marriage is a business contract and you must negotiate its stipulations and being ADHD, even more so. 

It is like with dogs. Dogs hate unclarity, ambiguity. A dog must know the rules set by the Alpha male. Your marriage is the Alpha Male Institution. He knows the boundaries. He can rely on them, which frees his actions to a preset range of conduct. You get a bad annoying hound if you let it pee the carpet on Wednesday but whip him with a belt on Saturday. 

Speaking of whipping... reserve that kinky stuff for a nightly time.
 I’d guess that if you are paying more attention to your group texts than your spouse when he’s talking, that his being hurt is not an unreasonable reaction. I only say that because I do that and my wife hates it. The problem is that my phone is a source of constant stimulation, so my ADHD brain loooooves it. 

He probably wants your attention and affection. Is there a way you feel comfortable giving him that?  I think for number one he just doesn't understand. He doesn't seem to have this problem nearly as much as me (he interrupts sometimes, but it's not as frequent). I also don't think he realizes that I generally sensor myself and when I interrupt is less than half of when I have wanted to.

For number two I think it's a combination of not being able to remember things (considering his ADD) and a feeling of rejection as well. 

 You're absolutely right, and like I just wrote in my comment here, if my ex-husband had received your advice and taken heed of it, who knows, maybe he wouldn't have become my ex-husband. 

But his downfall was the constant need for 1) someone to be right and 2) for that someone to always be *him*. >And he should stop interrupting you when you're reading -- that is a form of torture!

Yeah that's the part that made me upset on behalf of the OP.

I don't really like to make things gendered, but the "when things go wrong women tend to internalize it/men try to blame things outside of there control" adage seems to ring true here. (In general though, I know loads of lovely men).  I nearly said out loud "I love you Vaidif" as I read this! I was in a marriage similar to OP and, yeah, your comment felt like a good validation of my feelings regarding those times. I would have to put my phone down entirely for the moment and return to it later. 

He isn't always willing for me to do that, sometimes is only interrupting me for spurts (like to show me a gif of something or tell me some one off thing). The problem is it is him, phone, him, phone, him, phone. I'm maybe being too pedantic but ADD was merged with ADHD in 1994, and so actually your husband has ADHD. But ADHD has become more of an umbrella term for a slightly broad range of symptoms.

Basically the type of ADHD you have can vary from his and maybe you can try to explain that to him.

I used to get irritated with my girlfriend interrupting me and she told me the same thing about how she has tried so hard to control it. Despite that it would still annoy me. But that has changed now. For some reason it doesn't seem to bother me in the past few months and really hasn't been an issue we have discussed in a while. I'm not sure what changed with me to not be bothered anymore.

But it is a very real thing that can hardly be controlled. In my opinion, even though if he doesn't understand, you have told him that it's not intentional.


Maybe it's my emotionally damaged part talking now but doesn't he trust you on this matter? Why doesn't he understand that it makes you feel bad as well? Have you explained that to him?  It kind of sounds like he feels entitled to your attention whenever you’re in the same room as him. Which I get, but that’s usually a problem with emotional regulation, and there’s not a lot you personally can do about that. I think couples therapy with someone who understands ADHD is probably your best bet, because you’re not the sole problem here. It’s your hard-to-control tendencies combined with his somewhat unreasonable-seeming desires for how the relationship should be. That would drive me crazy.
