[VENT] My brother was diagnosed with ADHD years before I was, and it screwed me over. I didn't know about this until years afterward, but my brother was diagnosed with ADHD in middle school. My parents got him to a doctor and put him on medication. Turns out he reacted badly to the meds he got, they amped up his anxiety like whoa. So they all decided not to try any more meds.

Me, on the other hand... well, I guess it wasn't as easy to spot in me. There are so many articles on how ADHD manifests differently in girls, so I can understand why. I had established myself in elementary school as a "smart" kid, by way of being a curious sponge of a kid genuinely invested in the material i was being taught. I was able to pass all my tests simply by showing up and listening to the teacher. Unfortunately, that meant I never learned proper study habits OR homework skills.

When middle school came around, my grades tanked. Out-of-class work became the only way to pass class. Even though I regularly aced all my tests and quizzes, it was meaningless. I was able to get enough homework done squeak by, but i was the living embodiment of every teacher's frustration -- "Tsabracadabra, you're so bright and full of ideas. Why don't you just do the work?"

God, I know, right? Why didn't I? I literally didn't have an answer. I *wanted* to do the work. But I would sit down and stare at a text book, or a blank worksheet, or a stack of loose leaf... I'd stare at it for hours and get nothing done until it was time to cry myself to sleep in frustration.

My parents never thought to have ME tested for ADHD. Or if they did, they never acted on it, likely because of they bad experience my brother had on medication.

I learned to cope with my inability to focus on homework by learning to accept failure. I became very... zen about turning in mediocre work and getting mediocre grades. After all, I put so much energy and investment in trying to do well. If that was fruitless, then why try at all? You don't have to win. You don't even have to finish. Just do *enough*. 

I lost my drive to succeed, because i had to prioritize survival. 

I feel like if just *one person* had spotted what was happening and helped me develop healthier coping mechanisms & maybe put me on medication, i could have been the same bright student I was in grade school.

As it was, I didn't get diagnosed until I was *twenty-three*. 

I'm now a grown, independent adult with a house a d a dog. I'm content where I am. But sometimes I still wonder how much more I could have accomplished if someone had intervened sooner. :(

**EDIT**: I'm 30 now, just for context. I was in middle school in the early 2000s. :) Two brothers diagnosed in childhood. It was the early 80’s for one, early 90’s for the other. Neither did well on Ritalin and treatment wasn’t pursued for long. Both were definitely outwardly hyperactive. Our parents were told they’d grow out of it. Cut to 2018. I’m 36. I was being treated for anxiety and depression when my therapist suggested ADHD as a possibility. Within weeks it was confirmed. 

I dropped out of college three times in my 20s. I’ve been bankrupt and my credit has been in the sewer for the last 9 years. I have school loans up to my eyeballs and no college degree. My two most serious relationships ended in disasters- major issues included my mood, my temper, and my apparent lack of ambition. I lost 20+ years of my life to ADHD, anxiety, and depression. I am medicated now but I’m still struggling. I was supposed to graduate in December but have to push it spring. Of the 7 course I’ve registered for this year, I’ve susscessfully completed 2, recieved incomplete grades for 4!! of them and outright failed 1. The incompletes will be salavaged and I’ll get the credit for them but now have to more money to retake the one I failed. 

So, be greatful for 23. I was like you- I was smart and capable even though in hindsight I see the first signs were there around age 9, and I managed to do well enough. And between myself and my two brothers, my story is the successful one! They are much worse off. It sucks so badly that we were missed when we were younger but I admit I’m jealous of those who found out sooner and have been more able to salavage their futures.  I feel this so much... my hyperactive older sister with multiple learning disabilities was diagnosed at about 8. My parents were concerned about her because her behavioural issues were more apparent and she struggled in school. I had a reputation for being a gifted child with exceptional reading ability, and as soon as I started school they bumped me up a grade. Everything mostly felt pretty easy and I got really good grades with very little effort until about grade 5. I still had some behavioural issues, like getting distracted in class, talking a lot/very quickly, wandering around the classroom when I was bored, blurting out answers/interrupting etc, but my teachers didn't seem to think that it was that big of an issue.

 Around 5th grade I started to struggle with completing my work and my grades started to plummet. This got worse and worse throughout middle and high school, to the point where my parents and teachers were perpetually disappointed in me. No one ever asked if I needed help or if I was struggling, all they said was that I was lazy and disorganized and that I was wasting my potential and needed to try harder. I always felt like I was just messed up and I needed to figure out how to be normal.. I feel really resentful of the fact that my sister got diagnosed at a young age and got all the help and special accommodations that she needed and I got nothing. 

It sounds really fucked up to say but I feel like no one really expected anything of her, so any tiny thing that she accomplished was praised, whereas I was constantly getting reprimanded for not doing better and if I did do well on an assignment that I was interested in and able to focus on, people expected even more of me. Like she basically has only been able to avoid failing out of university because my parents help her so much, to the point where I think she hasn't really earned a lot of her grades. (I'm not trying to make fun of her, I know that she's trying her best and that ADHD can make things difficult, but this is just the reality.)

 I'm 20 now, and I feel like everyone is still disappointed in me. I haven't gone to university yet, and have been struggling for three years to complete online courses to upgrade the marks that I graduated with from highschool. I just got diagnosed with primarily innatentive ADHD in September, and I feel like it explains so much... but it's caused me to be so resentful of my parents and our family dynamic. My parents are both primary health care providers, and my mother was the one who suggested that I get assessed to see if I had ADHD earlier this year. I don't understand why she only considered it as a possibility now when she is very educated about it and clearly knows the symptoms. I could have had help years ago and achieved my full potential but my parents were too focused on helping my sister and dismissed me as lazy. Sorry to rant... it's just good to hear about other people's similar experiences. "I lost my drive to succeed because i had to prioritize survival"

That hit me deep...  I feel you. I tried to convince my parents I had ADD in the 90's, and they didn't believe me. As a boy without the hyperactivity component everyone just thought I was lazy. A few years after I moved out my brother told me a story. Mom was convinced my brother had ADD, so she bought a book about it. One night the family was sitting around the TV (as one did in the 90's) and Mom suddenly put the book down and exclaimed, "Oh my god! I think <onepercentshort> has ADD!"

It taught me that even those who have your best interests at heart won't always do what's best for you. You have to do that yourself. I relate to this so hard.

Being overlooked because you’re “bright” and can compensate in other ways when you’re struggling.

Being overlooked because you’re female.

Learning to just say “fuck it” because the frustration is too much.

Here’s how fucked the gender bias is and just how blind parents will be towards their own children, though: 

My mom is a clinical psychologist who did her thesis in learning disabilities in children. 

Not only did she completely fail to notice the serious challenges with executive function in her daughter, but IN HERSELF. 

*shrug* 

Took me til I was 25 to get diagnosed and prescribed.

EDIT: they’re/their I ghostwrote this My brother was also diagnosed and I wasn't.  I started to struggle in middle school too. I didn't get diagnosed until I was 23...didnt try medication until a few months ago (Im 24 now).

Hoping I can get my life in order...(so far it seems promising). What the fuck? Your brother getting diagnosed should have been a major red flag. At that point, everyone in your family should have gotten screened. Do your parents not know about the genetic heritability of mental disorders or do they just not care? Classic barriers to diagnosis:

1. Female gender
2. High intelligence

I'm sorry it took so long. My delay of diagnosis had profound life-damaging effects I don't think I'll ever recover from. Im still dealing with parents that dont believe me. I was medicated u til middle school so about 13, im 26 now and realizing j definitely need to be on meds, but my parents dont believe its that bad, after all i have a full time jobs
 and apartment right? I feel your pain, we all wonder where we would have been if *someone* had just noticed sooner and did something about it. My parents never believed I had it because I was really bright in school, passed all the exams with flying colors, and I didn't start having problems until homework started happening, but for me that wasn't until year 7 or so, so by then no one had even considered it an issue. I went to my paediatrician when I was 13 and said "I think I have ADHD, I'm having so many problems getting work done in school", and she not only brushed it off thinking that they would have noticed by now, but that I was just trying to get adderall (which wasn't far from the truth, I just wanted it for the thing it's indicated for...)

I had those thoughts in university, being constantly frustrated because I KNEW that I had ADHD, everything stuck directly to me, but no one up to the believed me. By the time I nearly flunked out my first year of uni, I had to see a counsellor who had asked me if I had ever been tested for ADHD and I said not really and they said I was basically a textbook example of someone who slips through childhood without being diagnosed. I still didn't do anything until I was done with uni but still it was nice to be acknowledged.

That said, I don't look back anymore at the fact I wasn't treated. I made a lot of choices based on my ADHD and quite frankly I don't think my life would have turned out as well as it did without it. I made a lot of knee jerk impulsive decision that now have me earning a good salary doing something I genuinely enjoy and living abroad with a bunch of great friends I've made, and I think it's because of the ADHD. Sure I might have done a lot better academically, but my late night hyperfocuses on random topics related to my field that weren't related to my classes at all actually put me way ahead of the field. I'm medicated now because I need to work 8 hours a day and can't live the ADHD schedule anymore, but looking back, what happened happened and I'm incredibly grateful with this constant source of frustration in my life that is ADHD. Yeah some things are incredibly difficult, I've never really had a truly clean apartment and I still get lost during conversations, but I love noticing everything that other people can't, or knowing a bunch of random topics that aren't really relevant 98% of the time but when they are I'm an expert. 

You can't think about what you COULD have accomplished, because even if you were medicated, would you have done the things that were actually good for you that were causes of your ADHD. Everyone seems to notice the negative things they did, because you're different from everyone else and they point out the negative things because those things are *natural* to them. But what about the positive things that they can't do? I've made a lot of very close friends because when I can't pay attention in conversation I try to read people, so I've noticed when people are down and always been the first to comfort them. I've started working in a field that's really interesting to me because I couldn't pay attention in class so I'd research stuff about programming computers, which turned into my career.  Honestly, I think I would have just been a boring run of the mill person without my ADHD or even possibly with treated ADHD, and instead I'm very happy. Never think about what could have been if only <thing> happened. There are so many variables in life, things might have been the exact same, things might have been a lot better, or things might have been worse, you just don't know. We only have the present and future to think about, and think about how to make that better, because we all have so much time to do things and we can't go back and change things that might have been. :) My mum has simular attitudes about meds. She struggled so much with my behaviour as a child but never ever sought any help or expert opinions, even though I clearly needed it. When my school referred me to be tested for ADHD due to my attention in class and inability to follow spoken instructions, my mum said she didn’t really believe in ADHD. 
She allowed me to do the testing, not believing it would show anything. When it came back as positive for ADHD she told me that she would under no circumstances be allowing me to take medication. She said that doctors just want to drug children who are difficult. 
She told me that if we accepted this diagnosis then I wouldn’t be able to have a proper job in the future. She scared me and I agreed to never go back to the psychiatrist appointment. 
Now, as an adult, I’m having to sort out this mess myself.  My siblings were never diagnosed with anything, but they were louder and demanded more attention than me. FWIW I'm certain they are both also ADHD too. Otherwise I feel the same as you in my upbringing. I would either put too much effort into things at the last minute or do just enough to pass ok. I was "smart" but didn't apply myself. I feel pretty bitter about it now, but being raised in the '80's and' 90's there was a huge stigma and stereotype about ADHD being a hyperactive boy's thing. So my lack of drive to do better than just the bare minimum to still get decent grades, but not really apply myself to push harder for what I actually wanted has screwed me as an adult. I feel like I got zero support as a kid/teen/college student and ended up floundering around a lot. I'm 40 diagnosed this year, and I'm basically doing ok, but man I regret a lot of things that I (or my parents) let slide. 

I totally feel ya.  This unfortunately happens a lot. ADHD is extremely heritable and typically if someone in the family has it, someone else does, too. When I taught elementary school I had so many parents who would say, “I have an older/younger child with ADHD so I know this kid doesn’t have it,” even though it’s really clear to me that that’s the problem. The parents think they know what ADHD always looks like because one of their kids has it, so therefore the other kids certainly could not. Of course I also wasn’t allowed to say a word about it, even about it tending to be in multiple family members. >I learned to cope with my inability to focus on homework by learning to accept failure. I became very... zen about turning in mediocre work and getting mediocre grades. After all, I put so much energy and investment in trying to do well. If that was fruitless, then why try at all? You don't have to win. You don't even have to finish. Just do enough.   
  
I'm a 30 year old woman too and this rang so true for me. At primary school I was in top set for most things, I was a good student (disruptive and got into trouble a lot for that, but I had good grades!  
  
Senior school... I just stopped trying. I could pass, I would get okay grades, and that was enough.  
  
Similarly though, I'd also feel 'superhuman' because I'd be thinking: "Well, if I don't try and I still pass, and my friends try really hard but only some of them pass, maybe I'm actually really clever."  
  
Then it would hurt more when I failed, because I knew I *was* clever, I *could* do it, but I just wasn't doing it :( I have nothing to add except I know exactly how you feel, same age and everything, and reading your story was like reading my own. I was always a straight A student while big bro was the one getting into trouble and throwing away his Ritalin. Until of course about 8th grade 1999-2000 when I became so depressed and stopped kind of giving a shit about schoolwork and my parents just didn’t get it. I wish someone had noticed what the real problem was and took me to a fucking doctor! I didn’t try Adderall until after college which motivated me to go back to school, but still. It could’ve changed my life. I never learned how to study and to this day, I am still learning. If you decide to go back to school, try reading Cal Newport’s blog about studying online. It’s short articles so you won’t get bored reading them. It’s been kind of helpful so far. Good luck to you and hug your dog for me!  This hit my feels hard <3  Oh this is a sore spot for me.
I've got a pair of twins. One is diagnosed with adhd, mostly because he has had serious problems for years, aggressive etc.
No doubt about it his brother had add. But he doesn't act out, and he comes through the day.
Should i get him the official diagnosis? Or should I spare him the "trouble" of having it in his papers?  This is literally my life story  Are you telling the story of my life?? Almost not joking here. Only differences are my brother is a twin, I'm a guy, my brother stayed on his meds but I never was even tested, and my issues didn't manifest until late high school.  Still the the general emotion and thoughts behind it all sound all too familiar. It took me 10 years to get through college and I have the same wonder at what could've been, I'm not doing horrible now either, but still I wonder where I could've been. 

On a positive note, as dumb as it may sound, it's good to know that other experienced the same thing I did in regards to intelligence. Used to be told I was so smart and I could also just show up, take a test, and pass without issue up until a point. Now I struggle to recall and retain information about what's going on the next weekend or a conversation I had a few days prior because I just couldn't focus on what's being said.  You sound like me.  Except I'm a guy.  I was diagnosed just before my 21st, my sister was diagnosed at 23.  Being a "non-standard case" (I could sit still), no one thought it was ADHD-PI, until college.  My sister was the "bounces in her chair, can't sit still", but was too bull headed, and succeeded through shear force of will. I didn't get diagnosed until I was 35. Looking back there were so many warning flags that I had. I remember that my parents would cut the plug off the TV to get me to do my homework. Problem was that I then spent all my time working out how to re-wire the plug and get the TV working again. Are we the same person? I feel like you just described my entire primary school, high school, and college experience. 

I finally got diagnosed this year (at 23). Trying not to look back at what could have been and pat myself on the back at how far I've come instead. 

Glad to hear you're doing well, though!

&#x200B; I don't have any siblings, but other than that you just described my life. :/ At 35, I'm still struggling to find any success.  I had the same issue of sorts. My brother got diagnosed and I didnt until college because I was able to do well in class. But then I failed my classes freshman of college. Got diagnosed, put on meds, and was able to do well enough to get my bachelors  I have just been diagnosed at 32 after being depressed for a long time due to my continuous failures.. I have started medication 1 week ago and I can only imagine how my life would be different if everything was as clear as it is right now. 

If I had better school grades (lost 3 years during education), And better work habits. Exactly the same in school as you, and they had me in our district's gifted program from 1st through 8th grade. Then high school was pure hell, I wouldn't have graduated had I not went to work full time & paid my friend to read the books & write "my" papers. And I did half a day during my junior year, at the local tech school, which gave me a better chance at graduating as well. I still got all B-C-D semester grades. But hey, my 159 should have made me perfect at EVERYTHING, including time management & study skills, and it was never thought that I had a learning disability bc I was just "so smart". I will get over it one day, but I'm still aggravated that nobody saw the struggle in grades 5+. I still can't read through a whole novel, even with Adderall/Mydayis. (And I'm a 41 yo female, just for connection & context). Thank you for your post, it makes me know I'm not alone. 💞 This is so frustrating. I was lucky to make it (almost) all the way through high school without a diagnosis or treatment, but my younger brother was diagnosed when he was in 6th grade. He's been on vyvanse for several years now with no issue and my parents were super supportive, even helping me find a doctor to get diagnosed. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to present day... myself, my other younger brother AND MY DAD are all on ADHD medication and benefiting greatly from it. It certainly runs in the family.

&#x200B;

Sorry to hear your family handled this so poorly. I wish I had been diagnosed earlier than 26.. but when I get too sad I think about [this conversation between Gandalf and Frodo in the Fellowship of the Ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jC-rRPKZ3U). It's not exactly the same but when Gandalf says "so do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us." and it's pretty nerdy but it reminds me to try and focus on the time I have now.

&#x200B;

Totally feel your pain though. Despite being fulfilled and happy, content and grateful for all that I have, there will always be that "what if?" nagging at me from the back of my mind.

&#x200B; I'm an only child, but parts of this still sound way too familiar.

The learned non-stress about bad grades, bad preparation and looking at a test I knew nothing about.

I was very good at reading and could get by for tests by just listening in the elementary equivalent of my country (schooling until age 12) and never learned to learn. And it worked for the first 1.5 years in hs, but then I needed the things I should have learned in those 1.5 years and started floundering. 

The inability to do whatever it was that I needed to do for school until the last second and even then being distracted half the time.

The *constant* 'next time I'll do it better! start sooner, etc' is very tiring.

I got diagnosed at 18, after barely graduating hs. I went to therapy after that to see what was going on and what it was that was causing problems. It turned out to be inattentive type.

I've now flunked out of college twice. I'm working to save up money and to give myself space and time to work on my problems without the stress of also studying. 

I'm going to meet my new therapist for group therapy today, hopefully it'll go well.  

The irony is that my dad has it too. We're very similar in personality/humor and also in our ADD traits. And apparently he never recognised it in me?

It sucks that they overlooked you. This is literally my story but reverse genders haha I (23M) was diagnosed this year, and my sister (18F) was diagnosed back when she was in middle school and also had bad reactions to medication. Luckily for me I was able to get A's all the way through to high school just on tests and stuff. The way I coped with trying to get through homework was through treating it like a video game. It was like I got a high from getting a question right and gained experience points for being a world (chapter).

Math and Science had come easy to me. The only way I needed to study was just go through each and every practice question in the textbook and I was set for the tests. But then I struggled to no end with English and History. I couldn't read to save my life. I had to reread a paragraph 5 times to understand it and would read 1-2 pages passively without realizing I wasn't paying attention at all. Writing was just as bad because I had all these thoughts but couldn't connect them or get them down on paper. If it wasn't for the teachers being patient and really wanting me to succeed, I wouldn't have done nearly as good as I did in those classes.

My parents always seemed to not fully understand mental health and so I never once saw a therapist and my sister only did because it was a lot worse for her. My amazing kindergarten teacher had actually brought my parents and I into a meeting once and was basically alluding that I had ADHD, but my parents were afraid of getting an official diagnosis and medication so they never went farther with it. I always wonder if it would've been easier on me if I found the right help for this stuff early on, not only with academics, but socially even more. I totally get it. I’m 31 and was diagnosed a few months ago. Had I been diagnosed as a kid I probably would have done really well in school. Now that I’m taking adderall have more focus than ever and motivation. I also have become a neat freak. I probably would have an established career with good pay if it wasn’t for not finding out until this year. My grades were shit all through school and I couldn’t make my mind up when it came to finding a major in college. Now I’m piled in debt with nothing to show for it. I’m not happy about the fact that no one even had an idea of me having ADHD. When I looked up the symptoms after being evaluated I found myself being the textbook case of ADHD, literally allll the signs were there so I have no clue how my parents didn’t know. I have ADHD combined, as a kid I was strong willed, loud, hyperactive, impulsive and didn’t listen for shit. Oh well it is what it is. Like so many you all, tsabracadabra has described my life almost exactly (was an older sister instead of a brother). 

Unfortunately unlike a lot of you, I'm still slogging through that black hole of self-esteem they call the education system. Any words or advice or support?

That is, if you could go back in time and talk to yourself, your college/high school self, what would you say? What do you think they needed/would want to hear? I am 23 and going trough something similar, kinda. Getting my diagnosis is a work in progress.. but I just wanted to let you know how fucking close to home this hits me. I’m currently struggling immensely trying to cope with the fact how much different my life could have been up to this point if someone just had noticed sooner. I want to scream in frustration and cry my eyes out over pretty much feeling like I’ve wasted my entire life up until this point. It’s hard to explain, a lot of shit has happened in my life. I’m seeing a psychologist for coping with this and my anxiety, depression and social issues. 

Tldr; I am 23, not diagnosed but getting there soon and this really hits close to home, thank you for sharing and I wish you too could have been diagnosed far sooner:(  I feel you. I'm not a woman but I can still relate all too well. My brother got his diagnosis before I even knew about my ADHD because he just simply was more severe. He was slower in school, did drugs and was antisocial. I was the more "successful" type. I had some good friends and you didn't see my struggle that hard because almost every educator I've ever had liked me lol. >As it was, I didn't get diagnosed until I was twenty-three.

46 here. Another one of us once told me: "Never play the What If game, it'll drive you mad". True. I am 20. Turning 21 soon. I grew up with a cousin who was a classic textbook representation of a little boy with adhd. Fidgety, interrupting, zero focus, loves sports and video games, but gets frustrated and can't fucking focus in school and hates homework. 

I spent my whole childhood watching him transfer from "party cousin" when he was off his meds on weekends to "business cousin" on school days that he took his meds. 

And here I was, the quiet daydreamer who would cover her worksheets in doodles and had her sketchbooks taken away in class. I was not very fidgety, just a kid who was always called lazy and whose teachers would constantly complain about talking too much. I was a "chatty kathy" meanwhile my cousin (who was in the same class as me) was a boy with "learning issues" and was cut slack and given understanding. 

I am 20. My boss at work tells me to quit tapping my feet. My boyfriend struggles to keep up with my conversations and train of thought. My mother thinks I am "so silly" and I am the family joke because I leave the TV remote in the bathroom, leave for work 2 hours early, lose my phone in the garden, and leave my shoes on the table. 

I'm so frustrated and I get it. A huge topic of family conversation when I was little was how my cousin struggled in school and his meds helped, the steps his family took to assist him. And another topic was how lazy and unmotivated I was. I could draw all day but I just couldn't do my damn homework.

Today I went to see my doctor and got my diagnosis. And he prescribed me adderall. I almost started crying right there. Tomorrow I'll take it before work. 

I've been waiting for years (unknowingly) and for about 10 months deliberating over whether or not my issues are imagined. My doc gave me a sheet to score my issues and I got 31 out of 40. And he said that most neurotypical people would score a 1-9. 

The relief....I just don't know how to describe it Damn that sucks. I'm angry at your parents and doctors for being so clueless. You're about as likely to inherit ADHD as physical height fer chrissakes. If kid has it so does at least one parent and probably most siblings.

I didn't realize I had it until I was 40 after my career was stalled by it for the nth time. 

We know it is better to ask ourselves *what can I accomplish next*?

Still, the bitterness and what-if games are real.  I feel this a lot. I've just turned 30 and finally finished my doctorate (taking 2x the normal amount of time), but I've struggled with procrastination/perfectionism/anxiety/all the ADHD shit since I left high school (or really before, but it wasn't as noticeable). ADHD didn't even occur to me for the same reasons, and when I sought help as a grad student I was just diagnosed as anxious and in need of better time management/organisation skills. I spent a lot of time beating myself up about my laziness and inability to get it together, which obviously made things worse. Literally stumbled across a post on tumblr or something and had a lightbulb moment, and found my way here.

&#x200B;

But my younger sister had some more severe learning disabilities alongside her more "disruptive" ADHD and got put on Ritalin at 7. No one ever thought that I -- the quiet one who was zoning out in class reading books because I finished my work in 5 minutes and got bored, or twirling around dancing constantly because I was obsessed with figure skating -- might also have it. (And to make matters worse/more obvious, my mother is a textbook case of untreated and unmanaged ADHD. But that wasn't a diagnosis in the 1960s.)

&#x200B;

Now I live in the UK, where adults with ADHD are considered not to be a thing; when I enquired with my GP about getting tested, he was like "adults don't get ADHD, and anyway you've done a doctorate, so that's proof you don't have it!" I don't have enough money to go private for a diagnosis, so it's all about the bullet journal and coping strategies until I can afford to see a specialist. :/ I'm so sorry for all the years you lost to ADHD :( But I'm also glad to hear you did get your diagnosis -- being able to put a *name* to my frustrations and my shortcomings was so... empowering. I finally know what I'm dealing with, which means I can find the tools to compensate and work around it. I hope, now that you have your diagnosis, that knowledge will help you move forward too. 

**EDIT** html is dead, self, stop trying to use it on reddit On the other hand, you didn't have a crutch like your sister, so you are more likely to learn coping mechanisms in an appropriate way. Especially now that you can understand your ADHD diagnosis.  >my parents help her so much, to the point where I think she hasn't really earned a lot of her grades

Why do you say so? Isn’t she the one having to study and take the test at the end of the day? Years after my diagnosis, when I had become a more independent and functional adult, I was visiting my parents for Thanksgiving. I had made a passing comment about my ADHD at dinner and my mother interrupted me -- "But you just think you have ADHD. You weren't actually diagnosed, right?"

I looked at her like she was nuts. I literally take amphetamines daily for this condition. Did she think they just gave those to *anyone?*

"Uh, yes mom. I went to a doctor and I have an official diagnosis. I have ADHD." 

So yeah. Parents try... but you really, really gotta get shit done yourself. Dang, that is crazy! So did your mom get a diagnosis too? Hahahaha – I feel the same way I feel weirded out about almost every single post in this subreddit. Like I'm being Truman Show'd or something...  I'm glad you were able to get the help you need, even if it was later than expected. You've got more time than you think, especially now that you've made those first few steps :) They could just not know.  Most parents do their best, she is 23 years old so information 10 or 11 years ago was not as available.  Not everyone could google and lookup the stuff we readily have available nowadays.  If it was a failure it would have been with the medical staff in not recommending firther screening... I think, if they did suspect something, their previous experience with my brother being so anxious on the medication made them decide to ignore it.  Agree, but I'll add one more.

3. Calm demeanor

🤔 Haha, my sister & mom used to have knock down drag out fights in front of the TV.   Its funny bc getting a dx is an advantage now.  My daughter is only 5 yrs younger than you & she had a 504 plan with extra time for tests etc.

I wasn't dxed till my 40s Thank you. And same to you. I had one of those “Ah ha” moments when I got the diagnosis and clouds parted and I could see my life in an entirely new light. That euphoria was short lived and I’ve spent a lot of the last 6 months grieving the life I might have had. But I do agree that being able to name it and understand it has been empowering to me and some of the feelings of failure are starting to lessen. I’m still working with a therapist doing CBT on the emotional stuff and I listen to podcasts and I come here to feel less alone. It’s just been a rough year and the last 3 years since my breakup and trying to get through school have been very hard. I do believe it will get better I’m just so exhausted with the struggle right now.  I say so because they coach her through all of her assignments and heavily edit them, to the point that I would consider many of her assignments basically rewritten by them. At the same time, she has worked incredibly hard and I don't want to devalue that.  It’s what I call “Mother with a scalpel”. 

Imagine you need brain surgery. 
On your left is your mother who loves you more than anything and only has the best of intentions for you. 
On your right is a brain surgeon with 20 years experience. 

Who do you pass the scalpel to?

Parents are great, but don’t trust them with your own health and well being. Obviously that’s hard when you are a kid, but it’s an important life lesson everyone should learn. Took me way too long to learn it.  Nope, she’s never thought to go get one. My dad recognized all the symptoms in her when I began talking about my diagnosis. 

She’s 68 now... doesn’t really work full time anymore. I'm actually 30 now, so it was even longer than that.  What is a 504 plan? And yea I had a friend in college that would get extra time on tests because she had a diagnosis and I always thought it was cool she got more time, but after talking to her about it and thinking about it myself, it doesn't seem that helpful for some. For her and I, we would still get our tests done on time due to hyperfocus during the exam. The only time it would help is if one day the stress or something was too much and mind would wonder too much during the test. So extra time  definitely can be helpful for some, but hyperfocus can definitely combat that.

Were you diagnosed before or after your daughter was? I always find it interesting when a parent seeks diagnosis when they find out their child has it or vice versa. I’ve been trying to explain this concept to a friend of mine who has recently taken an interest in my adhd diagnosis, that I grieve what I should have been with proper supports in place.  It’s a weird thing to grapple with, and not a lot of people understand, to me , it’s this realization that I’ve been wearing a label that isn’t who I am, and I’ve lived accordingly, and allowed so much shittyness in my life because I felt it was what I deserved. It’s exhausting , and nobody really understands, the solution most of the neurotypical people give me is to just not have adhd. Simple. Just do the things.  I haven’t told many people about the diagnosis. My previous ex and I have somehow managed to stay friends. He moved last year months before I was diagnosed. I did tell him about it and I sent some informative articles and videos so he could hopefully understand me better and see how much this had affected our relationship. Overall he has been pretty neutral about it- not overly curious or supportive but also not negative. But last week we were talking about my current school situation and I told him some of the drastic measures I’m considering to get caught up. I’ll spare the details of the convo but I’m really angry because he accused me of using ADHD and my extreme anxiety (it has been paralyzing this semester) over school as a crutch and excuse for not doing the work. He never understood my anxiety or depression when we were together and he uses examples of things I’ve accomplished to “prove” that I can do things when I just put my mind to them.... when we were dating, he’d always ask me “why do you do this” “why are you like this” “who does that????” Now I have answers for my 0-60 irrational temper, my “laziness” and “lack of ambitions” because surely if “I really wanted to graduate, I would just do the work” etc etc etc etc and these answers still aren’t satisfactory. So now I’m not speaking to him because I’m exhausted. Im not going to explain myself anymore to someone who is going to continually question my own reality as if I am not an expert on my own life and feelings.
