I suck at reading, especially on screens. So I get the computer to read to me. I feel like people don't know this but on a Mac when you highlight text (after you've set up it up in system at least), and press control+ escape the computer reads to me to help me keep my attention!

I do think there is an equivalent on windows, but I don't know how to activate it nor anything about it. (Sorry!)

I'm not terrible at reading, but this really, really helps. It doesn't sound too robotic. There is a semi-unnoticable breath after each sentence, and it makes it nicer to listen to. 

I love all your posts and I've never really said thank you, so thank you for helping me out because all the stuff I've learned / identified with to know I'm not alone had really helped me. Hope I can help you. ;) I just tried it for windows, Win+Ctrl+Enter opens the narrator on Windows 10  


Unfortunately it reads the entire Mozilla Window including titles and hyperlink descriptions, seems like it doesn't work on selections everywhere :/ Not even when you highlight the text you want read :/? Dang it!
