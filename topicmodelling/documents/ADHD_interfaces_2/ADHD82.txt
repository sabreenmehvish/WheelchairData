I want to start reading books more, but I have a hard time finding a book that keeps my attention and wil to read it, what are some you guys might recommend? I just want to add I never really enjoyed reading as a kid too much, I was able to read for essays in high school or whatever and once or twice found a book I would just read the shit out of, I used to collect red wall books cuz they looked nice and all my friends loved them when I was a kid and only really read one. (I felt so terrible I asked my parents for them and could never manage to get past the first few chapters)... 

Any books I did read I can never recall things from them, like I mean I'll only every remember one or two main things about the book, but the rest I feel like i just zone out and continue to read without actually absorbing..

I waste a lot of time on my own, and in my free time, so I want to better myself and I feel like reading more can really help me in some aspects of my life, especially since I've been studying engineering for the past 3 years and my connection to literature is pretty much non existent now. 

Anyone have ideas of popular books I could read that might get me into books more? I have a taste for many things so I'm open to any suggestions.


 I started reading as I started running: go short at first, then longer.

Start with some very short books (of mice and men comes to mind), and also some short stories and poetry collections.

Note that this comment may be easier to read because it's not a wall of text.  Likewise, try to avoid wall-of-text style books. 

\

Large print editions are awesome.  It's easy to find your place again after losing it.

\

Don't skip lines because you "get the point".  You will skip important events in the book.

That's about all I have.  Good luck! Not a book title suggestion, but a book consumption suggestion: Buy an e-reader

I can't fully explain it but I just cannot read from books. I get bored and distracted and never finish. Prior to getting my kindle I think I read 10 books for "fun" in my entire life. I've since read 40-50 in about 2 years.

Try it out first and see if it works for you. A friend of mine had a kindle and I was checking it out just because I like to screw around with tech stuff. 18 pages into a book I realized I was actually reading and retaining the story! I feel that short stories allow for shorter bursts of attention. Plus if you don't like one story, you can just move onto the next one.

Several Short Story Recommendations:

**Me Talk Pretty One Day** - David Sedaris (Humour, Non-Fiction)

- short stories from the author's life as a gay, homosexual male growing up in a dysfunctional family

- he also has similar books that are not Short Story format

**Villains Victorious** - Edited by Mark H. Greenberg (Humour (sometimes), Sci-Fi/Fantasy)

- Villains from various sci-fi/fantasy stories (ranging from well-known fairy tales to just fantasy settings) either triumphing or at least getting to recount stories from their perspective

**World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War** - Max Brooks (Fiction (or is it? :P)) 

- ...an oral history of the zombie war, some/most of the stories sent chills down my spine

- it's better than the movie (from what I can see from the movie trailer)

**The Things They Carried** - Tim O'Brien (Historical)

- short stories about the Vietnam War from the author's perspective

- he was drafted the year he graduated from uni

I'm not really sure where your literary tastes lie, so I provided an array of genres to hopefully get you started. If you want recommendations for other short story compilations, feel free to message me (I know a lot of good sci-fi/fantasy ones)

Non-Short Stories

**The Dresden Files** - Jim Butcher (Urban Fantasy)

- Wizard detective in Chicago

**Consider Phlebas** - Iain M. Banks (Sci-Fi)

- Part of the Culture series, can't really be summarized in one line

- May be a little harder to read than the other books on this list (read the Player of Games instead, by the same author)

**Something From the Nightside** (Urban Fantasy)

- Another detective one, but in London (kind of)

- Caveat: the writing in this series isn't very good (but it is very distinct), I was hooked on the weird universe this author created and it's a very easy read

I could never really get into the Red Wall books either, but I bought and read all 70-something Animorphs books.

Edit: learned how to **bold** things Steven King books work good for me. Interesting sci-fi/fiction books catch my attention. I also couldn't put down Harry Potter and read all of the books. I have a hard time remembering what I read but the more interesting the book, the easier. I have found Comic books keeps me more focused, as they are full of pictures and not as much text per page :)  I just read "The Spy who came in from the cold" 212 pages three huge twists and I couldnt put it down Harry Potter.  Always Harry Potter. I think a lot of it is just finding a subject that interests you.

Give me a book like "How Dogs Think", or "Cro-Magnon: How the Ice Age Gave Birth to the First Modern Humans", and I'll be all over them.  Give me a drama, and I'm off to snooze-ville. I found John Dies at the End really good, and it wasn't hard to read, so even if my concentration jumped a bit, I still managed to continue onwards. I'm the exact same way about completely forgetting about the entire book. I can hardly even remember the book at all unless I see it on my desk. I slog through most books unless its a rare one I really dig...

Charlie Brooker's books are collections of his articles from the newspaper about stuff on TV. They're hilarious and each article is only a page or two. Definitely check out "The Hell of it All" if you like his stuff (I'm sure you can find some of his articles if you google his name). He also has some fantastic clips on youtube, and a really funny, really dark, TV Show called "Black Mirror"

"How To Live Safely in a Science Fiction Universe" by Derek Yu is my favorite book ever. I've read it at 5 times in the last two years. It's weird, hella meta, and creative as fuck. He uses time travel and the related trappings as a way to look at depression and rumination and getting stuck in ruts (I think? maybe I'm just depressed and projecting..). There's definitely an excerpt or two online along with a few reviews.

I haven't read any Stephan King besides his huge book about a guy who time travels to stop the assassination of JFK. "11/22/63". When I'm reading any other book I usually hit a point where I slow down and look at how many more pages are left until the end of the chapter so I can put the thing down and get on with other stuff. That never happened with this book, instead I would hit the end of a chapter and go "ok... one more" and end up blasting through 3 or 4 chapters and getting to sleep super late because of it. That dude can write a compelling book

edit: as far as non-fiction goes... Game Design: A Book of Lenses is a big ol book about designing and dissecting games that always gives me something interesting to think about when I flip open to whatever page [deleted] I love sci-fi and fantasy books and sometimes just get really into them and can't put them down.
Some of my favorites if you would like to try sic-fi/fantasy:

* Enders game (and sequels)
* His Dark Materials trilogy (golden compass, subtle knife, amber spyglass)
* Hyperion
* A Song of Ice and Fire (game of thrones series)
Dune
House of the Scorpion
Galactic North
Shade's Children
The Bartimaeus trilogy (amulet of samarkand, golem's eye, ptolemy's gate)

Also, have you ever tried graphic novels?

300

Watchmen

Maus

V for Vendetta (to name a few I can remember) Try cats cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, 1-2 page blocks of text are your friend. if it makes you feel better, books lose their value once you read them so all of those red wall books (whatever those are) are still valuable to you. How would you compare an e-reader to reading from a phone or monitor?  I've tried reading ebooks on them before, but reading a monitor just won't happen (too cumbersome to read from) and I reading on my phone wore my eyes down, I think because of the small screen and harsh backlight.  I've been eyeing a kindle for years but I invest in things that become ornaments too often (a lot are books actually, I find them easy to justify buying even if I've bought well over 40 over the couple of years, not touched half, half read a dozen and finished two at the most).  It's one of those things I'd really love to have play with before buying, too bad everyone I know feels the same.

e: Also, do they have a text to speech option? e2: I guess not actually as this would be pretty damaging to the audiobook market. YES! See I actually wanted to buy an eReader, I'm a bit of a tech head like that too, and I played around with one of my friend's, though it was all japanese so I couldn't actually read it but it looked great. I've been wanting one and thought it could help spark my interest. I tried reading off my phone but its not pleasant. 

I have my eye on the kobo 5 inch mini touch screen, its cheap and I have a gift card, but my older brother shot down my hopes, he for some reason thinks its just a huge "waste of money", and that if i want to read I should "just buy a book". My family is pretty frugal usually and I'm known to buy stuff that ends up collecting dust because I get so into new things all the time. I still might buy it but yeah.. 

Can you download books for free too? (by this i mean pirate it)
I like the idea of not having to invest in a book i will never read, or might start reading and lose interest. Of course I would pay for it later if I did end up wanting to read the whole thing. 
 ^^ I absorbed so many books on my way to/from work.  I wouldn't have been able to make it through the first four Song of Ice and Fire books without the amazing narration on the ones Audible stocks. Haha I don't know if they'd be worth much they were like 7 dollar books I think. I do still have them all in top notch condition except one which I read the shit out of and the spine is all creased and whatnot.  It's nothing like a monitor, it's just like reading text in a book. Just don't get the Kindle Fire or it will be like a monitor. I highly recommend going to a Barns & Noble to try out a nook if you've never been able to experience e-ink before.

And actually my kindle does have text to speech, but I'm not a huge fan of it.

Edit: Here's a [good review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQvT56SyZKY) of the Kindle Paperwhite  Most will read PDF. Double check the specs when purchasing and your good. 

I not only read happier, but I am a lot faster! I have the kindle 3 with keyboard and wouldn't trade it for anything. Can you put your finger on the screen without activating anything, or like shutting off the touch screen? I only ask because it makes reading soo much easier when I can trace my finger along the words or line as I read so I don't lose my place, when I read on the internet or my laptop I have to trace along with the cursor, by highlighting (selecting) the text as I go along.
