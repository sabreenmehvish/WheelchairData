This "speed-reading" bookmarklet is a godsend for me. Displays one word at a time, really helps my brain from trailing off as I read articles. Hope it helps you guys, too.  This is interesting, but there are probably issues with it. I'm not an expert, so take all this with a grain of salt. It is just something I remember from a forgotten source a while back.

We don't process the things we read in a linear fashion as one might suspect. We process what we read in chunks. Sentences or clauses. This is important for comprehension of anything complex or involving syntactic ambiguity. This may help you read more quickly, but it will strain your working memory and potentially lead to less depth of comprehension. 

If anyone more knowledgeable than I would like to chime in and support or dispute me, I welcome you to do so. These are not claims of fact, but armchair conjecture.  It's alright, but it interrupts the flow of my "head voice."


Its!    Like!    I'm!    reading!     Like!     This!
 Can it work on mobiles? Android chrome specifically?  How do you expect me to read the same sentence 19 times in a row if I'm only reading one word at a time? Come aaaaaahn! The problem with speed reading software is that it's just computer assisted skimming. Basically the increased speed comes at a cost of reduced comprehension. If you are reading a novel, 80% comprehension might be ok, but with many types of text, you need close to 100% comprehension, if you want to understand the text as a whole.

For instance, when I read a academic text book, I often have to re-read some sentences several times, before I comprehend the meaning, and if I misunderstand some essential explanation in a single sentence, I might miss the point of the entire paragraph, page or chapter. I use a very similar chrome app, [spreed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spreed-speed-read-the-web/ipikiaejjblmdopojhpejjmbedhlibno?hl=en-US). It's nice, you just highlight whatever you want to read, right click, and click the spreed option! Both very similar. Nice concept! I've just installed it. This is amazing this is very cool!  maybe they will get an android app at some point for reading ebooks Ugh. This would be painful--  reading one word at a time would be like hearing. a. conversation. with. a. gap. after. each. word.   I think it would actually IMPEDE comprehension and retention.

If you only read one word at a time, you either need more practice reading (I.e., work your way through Harry Potter or something else fun), OR you may have a learning disability that affects reading (other than ADHD)-- you should probably go in for an evaluation- this may be something you can improve.
 Haha, make sure you are reading something with just simple words.  I tried it on a wikipedia article on a style of meditation and man I got nothing out of it when they started throwing out big, Indian words. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8023  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/17171) [deleted] It's a nice idea. The name makes me cringe for some reason though. I've always been an incredibly fast reader even with my ADHD Ling student here.  You're not wrong, but the brain is capable of storing whatever it processes until either the buffer fills up or it gets a full chunk.

After all, if we couldn't process things linearly how would speech ever work? I also will have to double check my post, but I don't think it's reading comprehension processing that we do in chunks, but our visual processing. Our eyes can only take in a few words at a time, so our eyeballs look like jerky movements from left to right as opposed to a smooth movement from left to right as we're reading a page. That's why it's easier for us to read newspapers: narrow columns. 

edit: [eye movement in reading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_in_language_reading) [deleted] I suppose it depends on your purpose for reading.  If you are a lawyers (my deepest sympathies), then yes 100% is important, but if I am reading about the LHC, but I am doing it for just personal enjoyment/ curiosity, the gist might be ok.  I suspect most of what people read falls in that category.  Plus there is always going back, as there are advantages to getting the outline in your head with a basic understanding first anyway (imho). It's not that I read one word at a time, it's that when I read normally, I often trail off and start thinking about something else entirely while still reading the words. This helps me not do that, and you can set it to go much faster.  Yeah I'm mostly using this for reading longer articles for pleasure, not really academic ones. I can see how that'd be frustrating! except this is now. that is soon. Yeah I don't use this for reading per se, but more for not trailing off in thought while not retaining it.  Our eyes just generally move in jerks and jumps, called "saccades." Our brain smooths these out artificially to make it look even to us. It's not just in reading. And it's both word-comprehension and visual processing that gets chunked, though both are somewhat flexible in terms of chunk size. Better than nothing.

Thanks for trying it out in the chrome beta, I wouldn't have thought of that :) It actually isn't working for me.  How do you get it to work on either of these articles from baseball blogs?  It just seems to go through some of the code and header sizing info.  Even when I highlight just the text?
