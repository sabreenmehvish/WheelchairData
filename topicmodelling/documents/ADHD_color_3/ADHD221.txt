I find that I keep re-reading or reading and then not remembering when I'm trying to study. Help? I'll be reading a paragraph for five minutes or so, then have realized that I'm still on the same paragraph. And I don't remember any of what I was reading. What are some things that have worked for you guys?  Someone suggested today to use [Cornell Note Taking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes). More detail at [the learning toolbox](http://coe.jmu.edu/LearningToolbox/cornellnotes.html). Not sure I would follow it, but I do wish I had known about this when I was at uni.

**Edit:** for studying, it would be taking notes while reading.  One thing that helps me TREMENDOUSLY is "teaching" while I read.

What you do is this: go to a place where you won't be distracted or interrupted, and read each paragraph as though you have to teach it.  Then, teach it!  Read it once, stand up, and tell all the imaginary people what that paragraph is about.

Essentially, what you are doing is taking something in, not with the intention of just memorizing it, but with the intention of explaining it to someone else.

I did this for some of my remedial math classes, after I tried everything.  I tried flashcards, I tried note taking, I tried having my spouse quiz me.  Then, an ADD therapist gave me this idea of teaching.  It's done wonders.

So for me, when I do math (where I really struggle), I read the chapter first (in sections) and I "teach" the sections to an empty room.  Then I do the homework.  This takes me less time than just doing the homework used to take me.  When a test is coming up, I "teach" formulas and equations to my spouse while we make breakfast.  The agreement is that she just listens to me talk, and doesn't ask questions.

Having someone help you is the tricky part, since they will feel the need to help.  This is simplifying a bit, but if you are working on "a+b=c", you want to just work on that.  It can get confusing for you if someone says "But what about 'b+a"?  Is that still 'c'"?  This doesn't really help, as it causes you to stop and "re-wire" for a second.  If you're going to have someone help you, make sure they listen while you teach, and bring up questions later.

Sorry if that's a bit much! I buy two one-subject notebooks for school.

The first one is the one I bring to class. That one, I jot down the notes as followed along with doodles upon doodles of random crap. This may seem like it's counterproductive but the thing with doodling and myself is that the doodles actually can help me remember. Like I see that picture of a T-Rex with an Abe Lincoln beard and I can remember "Oh yeah Abe Lincoln was killed by John Wilkes Booth in 1865...that's why its got a beard..." or other shenanigans. Mostly it's actual legitimate notes but the doodles can help me remember stuff I may have missed. 

The second notebook I keep at home. When I get home from school, I open up that notebook and transcribe the notes from the day the best I can. That way I will be able to remember by writing it down all over again. Repetition and kinetic learning is key here.  Read it aloud as if you're talking to someone.  Then try to put it in your own words by either speaking it (and imagining it in conversation) or writing it down.  I usually say each word slowly in my mind for a few lines until I'm paying attention and understanding it. Then I just go from there.  I major in math, it may not be as much reading as other majors, but I write my own notes. As in I try to "recreate" the equation, theorem, rules, etc as best as I understand it. Using color pens help too. Seeing it all in one color just ends up fading out in my eyes, so having different parts in different colors really helped. It may not be as productive or efficient as other methods, but when I'm working with non-math related topics it helps when I have someone to bounce my ideas off of. Usually I try to state what I think the sentence means and have the person have a conversation back with me. 

Whatever you do, do not highlight the book. You can take that statement as lightly as you want. In my experience, even though I don't highlight the entire book, I do notice later on that the highlighted portion wasn't important at all. Having a separate notebook made things easier. I've only started using this method, so I'm not entirely sure how well it works, but using my computer to take notes. What I mean is I have a tablet, and I downloaded this PDF annotator and with that I can take simple screenshots from my computer and then write around that instead. Sometimes writing one thing over and over just takes too much time, so a simple ctrl+c and ctrl+v speeds things up. This video mentions the advantages of "deep processing" for learning information. Basically it means thinking about what you're reading and associating it with stuff you already know. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O7y7XEC66M&feature=relmfu I take notes as I read. It takes a little longer to get through the page, but writing down the important parts of the paragraph requires a bit more concentration and keeps my mind from wandering. Then, if I forget things later, it's easier to go back in my notes than to find it again in the book.  Ditto. I have also recently figured out a process that works for me:

1. Read **one** paragraph

2. Underline anything in it that is important in the paragraph.

3. Summarize the **underlined** and write it into a notebook.

4. Repeat 1-3 until section is finished.

5. Go back through notebook and "box" every important key term.

The whole purpose of this is to get away from the textbook, and break the information down into smaller, more manageable chunks, so you can eventually "read" it by just looking at the blocks.

Edit: basically, I have found that just summarizing and underlining does not work for me, as when I read it, I tend to lose track and start that whole daydreaming/reading thing. Thus why I "box" it, so I am not actually reading it, but just piecing together the boxes. >Using color pens help too. Seeing it all in one color just ends up fading out in my eyes, so having different parts in different colors really helped.

I do this to, for my math classes especially.  I got a couple of colored pencils from the art store, and I use different colors for different things: red for formulas, blue definitions, etc.  It works brilliantly!

Call it two votes for colors with notes.
