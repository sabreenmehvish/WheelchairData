ADHD meds, My sleep, My heart          Sup /adhd/ 
   Recently I started talking add meditation (ritalin), but I want to change it because of heart rate issues; my regular beat is around 59 - 65  but with ritalin it gone up to 160 first day and is staying stable at 100 now.
  Anyways, all that is a bullshit compared to an unusual thing I experienced. I am able to get hypnagogic state (being half asleep experiencing hallucinations) whenever I want, and I like that feeling!
 But sadly, panic rises as fast as I am taking my trip and I can't resist my heart pounding. After experiencing panic pulse stays up to 100 for several hours, even if ritalin's effects are gone.
   Before taking ritalin I had that same thing during sleep paralysis and also during attempts to meditate. What is really interesting is that I have to do certain things in order to get into that trippy state and it's fully under my control, at the beginning at least, and I have no issues for having regular sleep.
   These are my actions to get into that:
1. Laying on my back with the closed eyes, concentrating in not moving them and keeping them closed. No body movements, complete relaxation. 
2. Imagining how I fly around my neighborhood remembering details
3. I start to see depth and color in my imagination. Later black is being replaced with white.
4. Feeling of euphoria. Heart rate slowly raises till I can feel it and panic attack starts
5. Extreme pounding of heart and euphoria with white light becoming more bright.
6. Finally I give up because not comfortable with heart rate. I stand up and my heart calms a bit, but remains fast for next few hours
    
The question is, how to overcome the heart's  temptation for awakening me from my freaking trip? And yes, my heart beat, should I be concerned about it?  You should consult a doctor. No one here is qualified to tell you if you have a medical concern.  I do not think it is a concern, just asking opinion.
Anyways I will see my doc on Friday
