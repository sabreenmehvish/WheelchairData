When you don't have something to obsess over and hyperfocus on, life sucks. Not yet medicated, should change soon. The only things that ever give my life meaning are things that I can hyperfocus on, obsess over, and think about all day. Things that really strongly pique my interest. I hate it when I have nothing that does that. Agreed. I obsess over all kinds of things because that seems to be the only time I can actually focus. Problem is I get upset when interrupted or even noise can drive a wedge in my focus. I think that is why most of my "free time" is spent gaming even when I have more important things to do.  Thanks for this reminder. I think our brains are happiest when focused on something intellectually stimulating, however those things are difficult for us to begin, or stick to... because of our ADHD. Thus, maybe we get involved with the “easier” options and hyper focus to the point where we get some complex stimulation from them but it still feels “easy”?

Lately I’ve been hyper focusing on colors. Like researching colors and trying to figure out what colors look good on me. Looking at lipstick colors. I mean, i don’t even wear much makeup, but this lends itself to obsession because number one: vanity, and number two: colors are so incredibly complex and I’m learning so much about them. Each color has a warm and a cool version of itself, a lighter or darker version, muted version. It is crazy. Then lipstick colors are even crazier because they layer on top of whatever combination of colors are in your natural lip tone, plus are juxtaposed with your skin ton which can change the appearance even more. 

Ok obviously my meds have worn off ages ago and it is late and this post is becoming useless.  Wow I thought I was the only one that felt this way.  Same  My life is basically pure bliss when I have something to obsess over, and then it's a horrible ball of depression and anger when I don't have anything.  --
