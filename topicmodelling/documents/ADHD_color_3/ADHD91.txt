so many colors! so many words! does anyone else ever run into [this](http://theawkwardyeti.com/comic/grocery-shopping/) problem while grocery shopping?

I thought I'd share this cute comic with you guys. I know I can relate! Not quite, but I do find going down the same isle over and over to find something that's in plain sight. This is hilarious and actually puts ADHD into a funny perspective. Maybe not food shopping, but my non-medicated self will go to do something productive and will end up dancing in my underwear instead. I think all of us can relate to this even if it doesn't pertain to food shopping. Lol, my friends and parents always make fun of me about how distracted i get in a grocery store.  
> Let's see, wheres the mil...oh shit they have chocolate cake yogurt? I wonder what other silly flavors they have.  Yes.                         
Cute! This is why I always (when I don't forget) wear my batman t-shirt to grocery shop.  I hate grocery shopping and this is usually the reason... Plus I usually forget my list at home lol shopping centres are designed to distract you into buying shit you don't need My favorite! People get annoyed with me cause they think I am being indecisive/wasting time on chocolate cake yoghurt. I am just looking at things, why aren't they looking at things too
