First day on Concerta, is this normal? Hey!

I just got my Concerta scrip and had a weird experience. Took 18mg (starter dose) 6:30, got up at 7:00, ate, showered and whatnot. when I got to school at 8:15 I was feeling funky (kind of like everything was just different), colours were a lot more vibrant and had a headache. I usually mentally die after a lesson or two but today I had energy for the entirety of the day.

My doc said I won't feel the Concerta at all this first week until we double the dose, but today was as described which was really weird for me.

Anyone else can relate to this and will I feel "less out of it"/funky if I double dose as my Doc wants to? [This guide was super helpful!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4mbi05/a_beginners_guide_to_concerta/) From my exp dubel the dosage wont make the sympthoms go away lol... the other way around is the usuall outcome Yes. Minor headaches aside, that’s quite normal. I think what your doc meant was you just gotta get used to the dosages. Very normal apart from headaches maybe. I felt the same way after my first day and I found that after just 3 or so days things get a lot more normal in a good way.  The colors being more vibrant thing seems like something to be wary of, but it could be totally normal. I only say that because a lot of people experiencing mania (with bipolar) express that colors seem more vivid. That, along with the energy thing, seems like maybe you should watch out for more signs. Not trying to scare you because you totally could be having a normal reaction. If you feel yourself getting *too energized* and feel like you’re wide awake/ready to take on the world even though you should be tired (at night) maybe call the doc.  Thanks for the great response :)
