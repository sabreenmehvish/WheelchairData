Prescription filled wrong? I just recently picked up my ADHD medication, Adderall. I usually get generic pink or orange pills but these were white and I took my dosage today and felt very sick. I looked up the pills , they were white and said M on one side and 20 on the other(eight sided) , they seem to be a different generic brand. The thing is , my bottle I picked it up in says the regular generic brand and color I get. So the pills in the bottle were not the type written on the bottle. Is this a serious issue or regular for when you get generic pills?  They gave you the wrong meds.  NOT okay!  Tell them ASAP.

[M 20 (Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine 20 mg)](https://www.drugs.com/imprints/m-20-8824.html)  Itâ€™s not uncommon for pharmacies to switch generic medication manufacturers, but they usually tell you when that happens. Call the pharmacy and tell them what happened. If your insurance and bank account allow it, you can have your Dr require name brand only.  For sure call your pharmacy
