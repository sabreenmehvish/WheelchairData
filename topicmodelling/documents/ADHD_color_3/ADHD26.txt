Do you ever feel dumb, cause you not getting things fast enough(for yourself), because you are impatient with the topic? I experienced it while i‘m studying stuff and Then i think: ”i really wanna get it. It‘s good to know those things“. You just want to know it NOW.  YES. Like - please just load this information in my brain, please!

But then other times I'm happy I'm able to learn/study. I actually enjoy doing it most times and hyperfocus. Would be nice to study in my one time and not be seeing the damn deadline (exams, mostly) right in front of me and stressing me out.  I have the same problem... that's why it can cause anxiety and depression. What I do now, (diganosed a few months ago) everything is a bit more time consuming but I write EVERYTHING out. In all rainbow colors, or on different colored index cards. I do this for a couple reasons. 
-- This allows me to dissect sentences and organize my thoughts accordingly. This way I don't skip over information or get frustrated from not understanding. 
-- It makes it easy to refer to these bits of info after I have moved on, because I tend to get to a point, seem to feel I've lost all info or get confused about something I understood a few minutes ago and then the broken down thoughts help a ton. 
--- I also (this one is a little more weird) tend to have a better recall system in my head with colors being involved. So if I have info written on a yellow index card, and I know the color of the card the info is then I can slowly begin to recall that specific info. This helps me a lot with tests. (I hate telling people this some times because then they joke asking if I can taste colors too... which with my sarcastic self I respond yes) Yeah. I want to *know* stuff, I don't want to have to *study* for it.

I realise that's not how it works! Unfortunately, my brain still complains whenever we don't get something the first time. It's a toss-up whether or not I'll manage to stick with it in those cases. Yess thank you for putting it into words! Always. I´ve found that if I try hard to learn, I learn less efficently than when I accidentally learn. It´s like my brain needs to forget what it´s doing to be able to integrate the information properly

Sometimes I feel like the information I tried to learn 6 months ago suddenly turns up and is much more available in my brain than back then... Yes. I really like to learn stuff and become better at things, but often I can’t follow the simplest instructions. I’m studying computer science and ever had a problem with programming languages(or understanding git) but really want to be good at it and always starting again with the basics(can’t remember things or I’m distracted by other courses). It’s very frustrating. Sometimes I don’t even try to learn. 
I hope this is changing with medication. It’s not like i have no willpower.  Omg yes I did this in school too! I had five colors that I used and every time the discussion in the lecture moved to a new thought, I changed the color. 
Stuff like this was and is the only way I can remember things, even though I want so very much to just sit down and learn it Your absolutely right. It’s not how it works. But often it’s very frustrating to realize you always need more time than most people. 
It’s hard but you can’t give up. Yes! Often after months, the topic comes in my mind and it’s like ”ok, I think I get it“.
