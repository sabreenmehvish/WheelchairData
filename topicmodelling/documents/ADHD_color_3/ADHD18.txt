Color filter Most of you are probably familiar with flux, twilight and other apps that filters the blue light from your screen and helps sleep patterns

I recently learned that using a color filter can help people with dyslexia (and possibly adhd?) too. I don't have dyslexia myself, but I downloaded an app called "color filter" where you can tint the screen in different colors. For some reason having a blue screen feels really calming. Idk if it's just the novelty or that less contrast is better for your eyes, but I thought I would mention it. 

You can also get tinted glasses and tinted paper to put on what you are reading.

Feel free to share if you have experience with this, and links and articles are welcome :D I find that I like enabling “night mode” or something similar on everything, so black or dark backgrounds with lighter text.  I sometimes turn my phone and my computer screen black-and-white. Distractions are (a little) less distracting that way, but it doesn't help with things that distract me with words (eg. Reddit). I got some tinted glasses for work because I sit in front of a screen all day long, figured it would help with eye strain and it does. 

Also, I look more clever with glasses. As an engineer, that helps.  Dyslexia cannot be treated with 'special glasses', color filters and all such things. Every now and then - and I just discussed this in another thread - someone pops up with some gadget or solution to dyslexia. It is all nonsense. 

But any person, dyslectic or not will find certain color options for your screen helpful. I used flux a long time until they upgraded the thing and it annoyed me so much I uninstalled it. I use the standard windows setting for it now. My screen is quite reddish atm.

 True. I made my screen negative at one point, and it was useful for 10 minutes Enabling grey scale on your phone is actually pretty popular on /r/nosurf right now. It works great. I should have been more spesific. I wasn't trying claim that it cured it, but that it might be useful. It's such a simple thing to do, so even if it's just placebo at best you don't waste much of your time. 

I like Flux, but I turn it off sometimes for the same reason as you mentioned.  Here's a sneak peek of /r/nosurf using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/nosurf/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!
