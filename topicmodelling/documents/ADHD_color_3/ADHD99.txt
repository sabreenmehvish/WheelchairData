For study guides: lists, tables, diagrams, or what? Hello to one-of-my-favorite subs! I was wondering if I could get some insight from you guys. I'm trying to up the ante on my studying and I have issues deciding on which format to try or when to even use which format for what kind of information...if that makes sense.

Basically, I was wondering for you guys: when learning information and like making studying guides--do you find lists, tables, diagrams, or what to be helpful in consolidating that information? I figure with the challenge of focusing and stuff, there may be a certain type of schematic that can help us the best. 

What do you guys think?

EDIT: I haven't received my exam score back, but my academic mentor emailed me earlier today to let me know that my score improved from the last exam--which is hopefully a good sign. Thank you all so much for all of your help!!! With ADHD, you want to "physically" externalize the info. Don't type notes - write them down. It makes an even bigger difference for those with ADHD. 

As far as what type to write on paper or white board ... that's personal preference. 

Personally, I like using a whiteboard, because I can walk back and forth, while writing vs trying to sit still, at a desk. 

But, if you like a desk, but also like fidgeting around, trying replacing your chair with a big yoga ball, so you can wiggle and bounce around, while writing. Sounds dumb, but for those that enjoy moving, it's a godsend.  Last semester I took an IP law class which was completely memorization-based: lots of concepts, definitions, cases, etc., but I managed to memorize more than I needed with these methods.


I snuck into unused classrooms and wrote out my notes by topic on the biggest white boards I could find. I'm always standing or walking around while doing this which helps immensely to satisfy my hyperactivity. There's also a lot of talking to myself as I organize my thoughts and pick out the important details. Once I have the board filled, I "teach" it/give a lecture with my notes to my empty classroom. Then I erase everything, proceed to the next "topic" with the same methods, erase that one, then do everything again with the first topic. Overall, I probably re-did my notes three times for each topic. Spent about 2-3 hours a day for three days in total.

My notes also have to be numbered. I don't know if anyone else does this, but bullet points just aren't effective for me, so I NEED to I number everything I have to remember. When I do, the memorization happens almost automatically. What works really well for me: Note cards. Question on one side, answer on the other. Shuffle and draw. Read question. Try to answer. Keep at it until you know it all.
 * copy your notes on a blank white paper, use ample color coding
* whiteboards, carry whiteboard markers with you so when you come across a whiteboard you can outline ideas and concepts.
* flashcards for breaking down information into bite size pieces (for me the smallness of the flashcard relieves my anxiety)
* have something to snack on while you're studying. keeps your hand busy
* try to stay away from tech devices such as laptops and phones. I print out things I need and close my computer. use my phone for quick searches.
* watch videos of the lecture material before going to class. I usually do this while waiting outside for class to start.
* use arrows, bubbles, sketches, small charts and lists, highlighting (but use only 2-3 colors or else it can get overwhelming)
* give yourself a lot of time to do this. don't cram. cramming=anxiety=getting distracted to relieve anxiety=not getting anything done. 

hope this helps babe Flash cards! 

Writing things out, NOT typing. There was a study somewhere that said our brains retain info we have copied/written out by hand because it uses some other part of your brain to form the letters with your pen or something. Idk. It helps me!  I actually really like this. I'm a huge fan of white boards and then like taking a picture with my iPad and reviewing the drawings and stuff. I also fidget around a lot but strangely, my most comfortable position is laying on the floor and moving around. I like having space...weirdly enough. Thank you, btw, for responding!! I'd like to add that, on top of physically engaging in tasks, it helps to engage all senses, even smell if you can. I used to sing out my flashcards for revision while writing them, and would draw little pictures about each flashcard while repeating the fact over and over again.  I've actually used my giant bedroom mirror as a white board. Fun and functional. I've been contemplating on flashcards. I have Anki and like it's UI. But I find that I tend to get anxious and make too many flashcards and like stuff too much information on them making them ineffective, essentially. How do you manage those parts of it, if you don't mind me asking? Yeah, people don't realize how beneficial moving can be for studying.  I also make a nice hard copy by hand of my whiteboard (where everything is nicely organized because I have perfected it using the whiteboard) and used them to quickly review before the exam. I love being able to succinctly cover a concept on one sheet of paper rather than pages of notes (although at this point it was more of a reminder so I already knew the little details). It's been a while since I studied, but I believe I simply broke it down to very short, simple chunks.. Almost like keywords instead of a script.  It depends on what you study of course. So, LOTS of cards (the correct word would be paper strips), rather than fewer cards with lots of info.  I used to use Anki, until I found that I would be frequently distracted by my computer, and wouldn't learn anything from just inputting information (I would go into autopilot). You can kind of replicate the UI by having multiple boxes to put your flashcards in, with boxes that you struggle with requiring more frequent revision. If you find that you don't know a fact in a 'well-known' box you can put it into the 'less well-known' box and so on. I find it rewarding because you can physically see your mental progress as the cards go up. The real trick is to go through them frequently, as you memorize you toss. That brings the pile down a lot before an exam. Typically I would have hundreds of flash cards total for a semester. By the end, I would only need to review maybe 50.
