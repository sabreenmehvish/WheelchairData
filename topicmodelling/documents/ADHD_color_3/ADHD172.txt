I'm terrified because I think I failed my chem midterm. Parents are going to kill me and school will be disappointed. Will almost certainly fail the AP exam. At least Oxford doesn't care about grade transcripts.

And yeah, I'm basically dying. High school is hell and reading is even worse. I know how you feel. I'm currently in highschool as well and am struggling quite a bit in my classes. I procrastinate, don't turn things in, and if I do, it's oftentimes half-assed and competed hurriedly during lunch. But 

I'm sorry I can't give you that much advice. I would say buckle down and study, but I know that it's nearly impossible to. Does your school offer art classes, music programs, or anything that is the slightest bit fun or interesting to you? If so, I suggest signing up for one next semester or next year. After I leave orchestra, I'm usually much more motivated than I was entering. It really helps to do something like that in the middle of the day.

Also, are you medicated? Meds can make you feel like shit at times, but they honestly help in acedemics.  Get someone to massage your back it will make you feel better and calm you down.

Being terrified like you are is not going to undue the past.  Furthermore the AP Chem exam is over 3 months away (early May) and if you are terrified of it, then you will do poorly due to a self fulfilling prophecy.

What you need to do now is be proactive after you calm down and find a study partner, and then start studying the chemistry but do it in a method that works toward's your learning style such as making the content more visual and colorful if you learn by seeing things and touching things and get overwhelmed by walls of words (many ADHD people are not verbal type of learners.) Update: got a C. Could have been better. Got an A in almost everything else though (including AP Calc) so I guess I'll take it? Ah thanks for the message, I honestly wasn't expecting any :) Rants can be pretty annoying. 

And trust me...I've tried. A lot. (To study). But the exam the next day just isn't real to me until 10:00 the night before, and by then of course it's way too late to do anything about it. And yes, my school does have some programmes, though none I'm particularly interested in (or really any that are good enough for me to consider trying out anyway). And I'm so burned out that the study I get next semester will pretty much be naptime. The closest thing we do have is sports, though, and I will probably get to run spring track (assuming I get the parents to listen - didn't let me do fall because they were worried about all of my work). 

And sometimes I wish I WAS medicated, but no, I am not. Heck, I'm not even diagnosed because my parents refuse to believe that anything is actually wrong. (I hang out on this subreddit anyway because the advice on here helps me anyway...) Yes, you're right. I know I was being irrational....was just too upset at the time to look at it objectively. Thank you.

I guess if I work hard I can still do well on the AP exam, I still have plenty of time to prepare. 

The class is just so awful and it's really hard for me to learn from it, though, it's very reliant on long, drawn-out lectures and an awful textbook with too many words...  Even ranters should get some sort of response. Unless they're being horrible brats. 

It sucks that your parents believe that you don't have ADHD. I can't relate to you on that account, so I won't even try. I'm probably not the best person to be telling you this-ah shit, what was I gonna say?

Anyway, I sincerely hope things get better for you. You were not being irrational, you were being emotional and since you were still processing your thinking you were still creating your feelings on what happened.  (Irrational is quitting school or deciding to not take the test because of 1 bad day.)

Trust me I sympathize.  I really did excellent on my AP courses in high school, only to get to college and get mixtures of D, C, and Bs.  Loved my high school chemistry for my teacher did lots of analogies and painted pictures in your mind, and kept it more to theory.  Only to get to college and wanting to shove pencils in my skull for the chemistry there was dull and hard.  The teacher could not teach it, the book was the wall of text, and now the stuff we were learning did not fall under "general rules" but instead were dealing more with the exceptions of the rules so you had to know the stuff backwards and forwards to get the right answers, and dozen of chapters of reading that just never end.

This is why I recommend finding a study partner, a person who can help you do it visually, with things such as flash cards, with colors.  

Perhaps learning the cornell method of note taking will help you.

[Picture](http://teachers.wrdsb.ca/phsspeced/files/2013/10/The-Cornell-System-Note-Taking.png), [another picture](http://www.ramagazine.com/issue/13/images/tactics01.jpg), [and a third](http://schools.hsd.k12.or.us/portals/20/Cornell%20Notes.png) and [wiki on this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes)

Effectively it is creating structure for your notes, first humans do not retain verbal words, instead we remember things a lot more visually, thus adding structure and color to notes helps a lot with recalling those notes later.  Learning verbal words only succeeds when you have complete mastery of the subject and if you have complete mastery of the subject you will not be studying.  But by organizing your thoughts into paper it is easier for your brain to remember, but it is also easier to get the core data your teacher is trying to convey to you.

My advice is to look up cornell method and powerpoint into google.  First you will find some quick summaries, but second you can find already made templates, or create your own within powerpoint.  These templates you can print out and use like stationary, or you can do it on a computer, and take notes, questions, and summary and have them in specific areas.  Furthermore with powerpoint you can easily color code each chapter with a different color or symbol helping learning, and you can insert pictures to help you remember.

And then when you are with a study partner, you can easily make note cards, or some form of game.  Keep the subject fun, and the more fun you do it the more you learn (due to things with neurotransmitters such as dopamine and acetylcholine), and the more you will not avoid the subject. Ah, thanks. :)

Just wish I could do something better with myself than rant on reddit... #####&#009;

I think a huge issue is my complete inability to take notes - in class, I absorb nothing and it is not unusual for me to zone out for 20-30 min and also take a walk in the middle of the lecture. And the textbook is massive. Idk if you remember, but you had a really long text post on here once and it was way too long for me to actually read that thing - the feeling I have with my chem book is much much worse.

I've tried EVERYTHING to deal with this. But usually when I try I end up curled into a ball on my bed or entertaining myself on youtube or some random subreddit. It doesn't work and makes me feel like the most useless person in the world.

But getting a study partner is probably a good idea. I'll ask one of my friends. :) You can start by getting off Reddit. Oh trust me I sympathize.  Even if you find the subject interesting for 5 minutes out of 45 minutes, that still leaves 40 minutes of mind wandering, and I personally have a huge problem with mind wandering.

Would a fidget toy help, something like a stress ball, or a spinning ring, or something you can physically do to keep yourself from mind wandering, (keep the "active mind active" instead of the mind wandering "default mind") yet has so low cognitive load that you can do the focusing in class.

And trust me I understand how hard it is to take notes in class, you just need to find the right balance for you.  Perhaps a toy, and you write the 5 big sentences you need to remember for each day's lecture. I did, shortly after that. :) For us, it's 5 min out of 60 min. ;) So an entire 55 min of self being an idiot. 

And yes, fidget toys help...to some extent. I can't go more than 20 min without walking around though. It makes me go insane and can get really stressful, so they defeat the purpose, and the toys themselves somehow distract me? Idk just a really screwed up person here.

Thank you for being so helpful though! :) Oh trust me I understand.  Was talking to my doctor about this yesterday.  I am now taking 4 college classes back to back (I am a returning student and I am going to actually finish my bachelors) and I was complaining about how I have 6 hours where I just have to focus and not daydream, and I wonder if he had any advice.  He is an ADHD specialist, but he thinks me complaining about me being restless in class is an anxiety problem (I have ADHD, Anxiety, and a lot of other comorbidities) and I am like no you could be right, but I am 90% confident it is just being ADHD, and he said okay but personally I think he is thinking is more anxiety related... we see if I need more help for I can always reschedule sooner than 4 weeks if its obvious what he said is not enough.

Sorry, ranting about yesterday which was for the most part awesome, but it was not perfect and that 5 minutes of a 30 minute session was not satisfying to me.  I was hoping for a magic bullet or something from my psych. Nah it's okay, I get it - I obviously rant too much myself. And I'm probably one of the least equipped people to say this, but it's possible your doctor is misinterpreting something. He's still human, and isn't inside your head. If instinct is telling you that it's the ADHD you are probably right.
