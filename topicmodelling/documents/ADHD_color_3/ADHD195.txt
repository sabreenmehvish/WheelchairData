Therapist wants me to find ways to deal with ADHD without meds Hi there, I'm new to /r/ADHD and Reddit in general. For the past couple of years my mom has thought I had ADD due to my miniscule attention span, horrible forgetfulness, no organizational skills to speak of, and general ability to get bored with and distracted from ANYTHING (even if I enjoy it) in 5-15 minutes.

So lately I have been seeing a therapist provided by my school to help me deal with social anxiety. We talk and she gives me challenges to work through to help me get better at coping with social situations. We talk for around 30 min every Tuesday or Friday and last time we had an appointment, it took a different route. 

She asked me if I had been feeling anxious in general in school and I told her that I get anxious if I get bored in class. So basically we start having a conversation about my lack of attention, getting distracted extremely easily when I'm bored, and how I'm having a hard time in class because when I get bored I can't do work properly and end up getting distracted by my phone or my friends and wind up having a crap load of homework to do (which I never really get around to) and she says "It sounds like you have ADD" So we talk about that for a little bit and when our session is coming to a close she asks me to research ways of managing ADD without medication because she feels that medication isn't always needed for cases of ADD (She never spoke to my case, she says she wants to try a "period" of trying to manage with out medication) and that she wants to try that before I go to a doctor about my issues. I wanna get diagnosed but I'm also nervous about what could come out of it. I just worry that if I don't find a way to cope that my grades will start to plummet (I have about an A average in all classes).

So basically my question is, has anyone found good ways of dealing with ADD without medication? If so which ways are the best that you have found?

tl;dr: Home life and school life suck because I can't hold my attention on anything for more than 15 min. and my therapist thinks I have ADD and wants me to try managing it without meds before going to a doctor about it. Do you have any suggestions? I suggest seeing a psychiatrist.  You can still keep your therapist, because that's cool too. A therapist is not medically trained, so should not give an opinion on medical treatments.

However, there are a bunch of coping strategies that you can learn. The difficult part is learning good ones not bad ones. Making lots and lots of lists, probably good, lying to get out of things, probably bad. Hi there, 

There are a ton of things you can do to help your ADD without meds - but, really many studies have shown that the best treatment is a combination of medication and behavioral changes. Since writing all of them to address all aspects of your life would be a bit of a bear, I will just focus (seewhatididthere?) on a single aspect you cited: class.  

A lot of people find that a small amount of physical activity can help them focus for longer periods of time, especially in situations like classes. I had one friend who knitted through her entire four years of college, for example. Some kids tend to shake their leg or bounce their knee. 

**fidgets** If you want to be purposeful about this, you could get a fidget (or six) that you could fiddle with while you are in class, thus giving your hands a little something extra to do. A stress ball. A spinning ring. A hand puzzle. They even have cool pencil top fidgets that you can fuss with that aren't very disruptive or obvious. 

**oral motor stimulation** You might have to get permission for this one. As an extension of the above, you could sort of double down. Chew gum or suck on a sucking candy (jolly ranchers, etc.) This has the dual benefit of giving your body something to do while not inhibiting your hands for notes AND adding a layer of stimulation - flavor, especially if it is very sweet/sour. Plus, there is the potential added bonus of associating a certain flavor with certain material, thus perhaps allowing you to recall said material better, say during a test, if you suck the same flavor candy as you did when you studied/learned it.  

**back up** get an audio recorder of some sort (there are phone apps, but I don't know how your teachers would feel about this one). There are some pens on the market, for example that will do this for you. Record every single one of your lectures. When you get home at night, have a program like dragon dictate transcribe it into a word processing program - or do it yourself. That way, if you missed something because you lost focus in class, you are still bound to have it later. Alternately, arrange (perhaps through your school's office of disability services) for another student or the teacher to give you a copy of the notes each day (have them take a picture with their smart phone and send it to you)  

**set silent alarms** you can either set your phone to go off (silently, on vibrate mode) or get one of those nifty watches every 10-15 minutes or so. The theory is that the silent alarm will jolt you out of your potential day dream and remind you to focus back on your lecture again.  
 
**make your notes interesting** get a pen with a zillion different color inks. Write entirely in sharpies. Get some of those notebooks that are filled entirely with black paper, then take your notes in different colors of fluorescents, or gel pens, or metallics. You could even color-code them (red for formulas, blue for definitions, etc.) This'll keep you a bit more engaged with the material and will even help you out later when you study. 

**food/sleep/exercise** This is basic stuff, but I don't know anyone who doesn't struggle with it. Get lots of sleep. Tons. Wake up in the morning feeling well-rested. I don't care if that means you need to go to sleep at 8pm. This WILL help, very very much. Eat good stuff. Try to eat less crap. Try to up your protein intake. Protein seems to help (or at least it helps me). Get some exercise in. I am told that this does wonders. I wouldn't know.

**write down your work** get a notebook/memo pad/planner. write down every single bloody thing or due date or assignment your teachers mention in that one damn place. Try not to lose the notebook. Just to be safe, see if you can get your teacher's permission to photograph the board at the end of each class - or in the middle if they have put notes up. Just to be extra safe, make sure you have the name and number of at least one other person in every class so you can check up with them if you DO lose the book. Keep a list. Make copies. Not just in your phone.

**get extras** This one might get a bit pricey and require parental buy-in. Get an insane number of supplies. Tons of pens. Reams of paper. Highlighters. Protractors. Whatever. Keep some at home, some in your locker, some in your backpack and carry some with you. Give some to your parents or friends so they can give them to you when you lose yours. That way, you always have what you need to do what you have to do in class, and it is one less distraction.  See if you can get your parents to buy you extra copies of your texts, plus review books, etc. That way you can have your own copy you can mark up.

**Optimize seating** see if you can get your teachers to allow you to sit up close, front and center in your classes. That way you minimize the chances of getting distracted by your friends' antics in front of you and your teacher is right there to help keep you honest. 

Good luck! Exercise and diet (supposedly) help a lot. Hard for me to say :)   have q hard time with exercise. I go crazy with the repetitive activities and it is too hot here (AZ) to do a lot of outdoor things for half the year.

I don't think you need to wait to go see a doc. Medicine really Can help a lot, if you stick with it and try hard to be somewhat active.  Here's what you should do first: GET DIAGNOSED!

You and your therapist made an educated guess, now please let a professional confirm or deny whether you have ADHD. It doesn't have to be. Narcolepsy, depression, anxiety and loads of other things share symptoms with ADHD.

Medication may not be "always needed" (an opinion I personally strongly disagree with, but whatever) and you can always choose to not use medication. You still need a diagnosis. Worry about medication later. First of all, you definitely don't need to wait before seeing a Doctor. There's no reason to turn down help that's available to you. 

Second, I think the dialogue around ADHD has created a false dichotomy between "managing ADHD" and "medicating ADHD". If ADHD symptoms are affecting your life and you're struggling, you will need to develop coping mechanisms to mitigate the symptoms or you're gonna have a shit time of things, medication or no. The medication is great because it can empower you to initiate and follow through with whatever ADHD-defeating system you develop for yourself, but it doesn't really do much on its own (source: I took my adderal today and am writing you a multi-paragraph comment instead of working on my grad school app, because I thought I could just 'go on reddit for a few minutes before starting'.)

Here's the good thing: you seem to have lots of people batting for you, and lots of resources at your disposal. (A supportive mom and a therapist with whom you have an open dialogue is huge. You're very lucky!) You also seem to be really smart and have a great attitude, open and positive! You're gonna pull through.  

Here's the tricky thing, no one's really going to be able to give you a foolproof coping guide. Definitely do research to give yourself some ideas and a framework of thinking about your specific symptoms and solutions. (You probably don't need to research coping methods 'without medication', because again medicated ADHDers also implement behavioral methods.) But honestly, you're just gonna go through a lot of struggle and trial-and-error to find coping methods that work with your brain's idiosyncrasies. And that's ok! Don't beat yourself up when something doesn't work or you mess up a bit, you'll learn something and your system will get better for next time. 

Again it probably wont be much help for you but I can tell you some of the tricks that helped me get through college. (You think high school is tough, just wait!) It basically boiled down to almost ritualized hyper-organization. I bought a VERY specific planner that laid out the week in a visually-organized way, and at the beginning of each semester I transcribed my entire syllabus for each class into it, color coded. All my due dates were in one place and my workload was easily visualized. I also kept a separate, color coded binder for each class, which helped me make sure I had and could find what I needed for each class and also helped keep me focused on one task at a time without getting too overwhelmed by a big generic pile of "work". I have my methods for managing dense reading assignments, studying, and writing big papers as well, but this is already ridiculously long. (It's scary long! Sorry!)

if you want, PM me and I can tell you more of what works for me, or help you find some good material. Or just if you want someone to bounce your thoughts/ideas/worries off of. Support really, really helps. 

tl;dr: It's a tough, trial and error process to find coping methods that work for you, but you have lots of resources and you'll be just fine! 
 Thanks so much! This is exactly what I was looking for. I will probably talk to my mom about going to the doctor for a test but, I guess I'll just have to wait and see. Thanks a lot! I'll talk to my mom about bringing me to a doctor. I have a meeting with a pediatrician on May 27th but it's for me being sleepy all throughout the day no matter how long I sleep for, so I don't think I should bring it up than. Thanks again for the tips!!! It's not that I don't want medication, if it will really help then of course I would want something that helps. But my therapist told me not to worry about going to a doctor because she told me that she wanted me to try managing without meds first, before involving a doctor. i would love to hear about your methods. Would you consider posting them? Thanks a lot! I will definitely talk to my mom about taking me to a doctor. I agree that it's nice having so much support especially from my mom. I try to get myself organized, I have color coded dividers in my binder, the only problem is I can never get around to it. (I'm really bad with procrastination) I try to get organized but everything just ends up messed up again. What is it you're waiting for? Ok, I'm a bit tired so I didn't explain myself well. Round 2: Your therapist is wrong.

She seems to think that getting diagnosed forces you to use medication. She is wrong. You first get diagnosed and then you can choose to use medication or not. They are two completely different things that have nothing to do with each other. 

It's your choice of course, but her reasons/arguments on why you should wait are simply wrong.

As a sidenote, unmedicated people tend to manage ADHD alarmingly terrible in my experience, but that's for another day. Yes, I think everyone here could benefit from seeing them. Of course! Anything specific you're wondering about? Acadamic college stuff?  I'm 26 and long out of college, but I'm hoping to go to grad school this fall so it might not be a bad idea to revisit some of my old strategies lol.

Getting through dense college-level reading involves reading very actively. I found what worked for me was highlighting (i actually always used my favorite pen to 'block around' sections) the the words/phrases/sections that struck me as the important, take-home ideas. Reading without a pen/highlighter was basically useless, because I'd get to class and have only a vague memory of what I'd read. The cool thing is that if you highlight/whatever while you read, you've not only made yourself a blueprint/outline of the important information that you can go back to, you've also already helped your brain remember the parts of the reading that were meaningful to you. 

With studying for exams, I always had to find some way to *reconstruct* the material for myself. Literally, I had to actually make something. That often meant making a big outline of all the information, using the syllabus as a guide. Occasionally (but less so) it meant flash cards. Once, for a "primate behavior" final, I made a comprehensive primate taxonomy chart, with pictures and defining characteristics, that took up my entire wall. (I still have it!) Once again it did two things, it provided a great last-minute study guide, but more importantly the act of **making** it helped my brain soak up the information I needed.

 I've found that "coping methods" are not so much a general set of rules or systems (that are always going to be easy for an ADHDer to break and subsequently feel bad about); they're more about building habits that make the hard stuff easier to handle. When you build a good habit its the best because its basically automatic, you don't have to think about it! 

(So I'm getting a little off track here but I actually think this is really important, u/ilovealtcoins you should do some research on habit formation. That may really help!)

ok umm... my adderall is clearly wearing off. hope that helped?
 That's ok! That's gonna happen! That's just what having ADHD is like lol. Just keep doing your best and don't beat yourself up.

Here's epiphany I had, when I worked in a special education high school class. **Don't compare yourself to other people, measure yourself with your own yard stick!** Most of the kids were pretty happy, they did their best and took pride in their strengths and accomplishments, whatever they were. But one kid (who had autism) and was always miserable and furious with himself for not being like 'the normal kids'. It sucked. And I realized that I was doing that to myself! I was always angry at myself for not being able to maintain a 'good housekeeping' level of organization, or whatever. 

Now, I try to remember that I will NEVER be a completely organized person with a great memory, but I can keep myself from sinking, which is pretty great, and do a lot of other things pretty well too. :) My therapist told me not to go to a doctor before a  "trial" period  of managing without medication. But I could ask my mom to take me to our doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist. Okay, well I'm going to a pediatrician on the 27th about being sleepy all the time, so I'll bring up my attention issues too and see where that goes. Thanks for the advice!
