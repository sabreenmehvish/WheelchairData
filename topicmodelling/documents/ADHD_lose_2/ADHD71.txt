Hidden costs of ADHD? Today alone- $16 in overdue fines at the library and $20 in missed appointment fine at the doctor. 

Prescription for a month of wellbutrin and adderall $95.

How about you?  Vyvanse eats like 25% from my income. Electricity turn on fee... minutes 
after it being shut of...late notices stacked somewhere, just slipped my mind 1000 times.
(30 minutes on phone explaining how forgetful I am and bashfully requesting it be flipped back on) 30.00 fee 10$ time.

express shipping for *not getting around* to purchasing college books on time. 
+25.00

organic gluten free cereal & nut milk gone to mush, distracted while eating. 
4.00

forgetting something critical at home realizing 1/2 through the Lyft route. 2nd trip.... forget another critical thing like phone. 3rd turnaround. a 75.00 school day 1 way.

20 minute late cancellation of appointment, deposit absorbed. 
50.00
 
taking care of half the groceries...coincidentally, none of the frozen stuff was in the 1st round. 
40.00

I could do this for days... but I think I have 3 cold cups of coffee and mushy cereal to find and not eat.

they must be hiding under my keys, headphones, debit card, probiotic pill, the "good" shears, or 1 of 12 phone chargers.

what a waste of a perfectly capable human. In the past decade I have paid literally thousands of dollars total because of plane tickets and bus tickets bought for wrong days/months. 

I’d say that when you add up everything ADHD probably costs me about two grand a year in missed deadlines, travel rearrangements, poor meal planning, late fees, and last-minute price changes.  About $25 a month to replace forgotten or lost phone power cords and USB adapters. I owed $42 at the library last time and had to pay $20 to use my account again. Now I have like five overdue books, so god knows how much I owe now. They have been sitting in my front seat for about a month. :( I'm done with the library after this. Buying books is cheaper! $2000 for absentmindedly chewing on a jawbreaker. Wtf!  That's me, at a certain point, you just forget that you  have books and end up with 50$ CAD as a fine during summer. Mail-In Rebates:  

I dismiss the very thought of it.  Experience has shown I never get around to mailing the damn thing out, so it's *not* a sale price. Man, you may have found a medication that works but you could look into trying another one with a generic option to help with cost.  Wow!  On of the several reasons I'm concerned about leaving aurobindo amphetamine salts. I don't want the Millville cereal once I try the Kellogg. Ahhhhh my life. The amount of cups of coffee I have downed cold or reheated 4 times. 
How many late payment and interest fees to the age of 46- I am finally not broke anymore so I can say that is definitely one happy thing about having adhd and a little money.  Ugh. 
I missed a flight to Italy where I was bringing a puppy for a client. Could only rebook for a day later. Hotel room + flight change fees = $800. Embarrassment for myself to the client- cannot price. 

We just went back to Europe and flights jumped $300 each before I could commit to dates and such.

Spent 15 HOURS choosing and Airbnb in Paris and another 10 for Rome. My travel companion was happy with the first one listed, but I was NOT. It had to be perfect 🙄

Oh and the entire plane boarded for Montreal while I was buying gum in Rome and he was standing at the gate waiting for me to return and silently wishing I was normal...  Also me. I have 2 chargers for every room and still manage to sometimes wind up with none for the car or hotel room 🙋🏻‍♀️ And earbuds  Shoot bro 💸 Oooo $3000 because I had a bruise appear suddenly and couldn't remember the source. Family urged me to go to the ER and a few tests later... it was just a bruise. Yikes dude. I was thinking, the adhd community probably funds all library staff Christmas parties.  Christmas 🎄🎉💃🏽🕺🏾📚🍸🍻 Amen.
We need instant rebates. 
Screw that mail-in malarkey. They are basically BANKING on adhd people buying from them so to not have to pay it out.  There's no Adderall or similar in my country, Vyvanse is the only amphetamine-based medication available. Vyvanse can be pricey.  Without insurance, it can easily be $250/month after Shires' coupon program, which is 1/4 of a full-time min-wage paycheck right there. $3,000? What the fuck? >They are basically BANKING on adhd people buying from them so to not have to pay it out. 

Pretty much my thoughts exactly. Ahh I always live in my bubble.. that’s a rough situation to be in. Wonders if it’s better than my bupropion + amphetamine xr combo. Xray, Ultrasound, and some blood tests. Plus an urgentcare where the nurse there ALSO told me to go to the ER. How the fuck does that cost $3000?


America is nuts America! Fuck yeeah!

If I wasn't on antidepressants, I might have tried suing the urgentcare. A nurse \*should\* be able to identify a bruise.
