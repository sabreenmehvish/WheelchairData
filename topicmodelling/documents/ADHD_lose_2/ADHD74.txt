How to never forget your bag on public transport? Hey guys (and girls),

&#x200B;

I've got a question. This time not for myself but for my sister. Although she's never officially been diagnosed with AD(H)D, she is quite forgetful. In the past year, on multiple occasions she has forgotten her bag on a train, sometimes at considerable cost. (but advice on any public transport is useful). At the moment she needs a new laptop for her work. Compared to those previous losses, losing your expensive laptop with all your documents and photos is a much bigger problem. So I was wondering, do you guys have any tips on how to make sure she never forgets her bag? I've seen some stuff on gadgets with distance-alarms, does that work? (or is the distance too small in train compartments for this to work?) or does she needs something else? Any tip is useful!  
 For me it's simply putting my arm through one of the straps on my bags Develop anxiety over forgetting random items. It's not healthy, but it works :D

Or, keep stuff preferentially in pockets. This is not very practical for girls, since clothing brands just assume we don't need pockets, but it's definitely harder to lose stuff that you store in your pockets. Unless your city has a pickpocket problem, that is. Most of the time you can store documents, money, keys, and phone in a pocket.

Messenger or cross-body bags are also a solution. One of the best skills I developed to accommodate my forgetfulness, I somehow started in elementary school. Whenever I stand up to leave a seat in a public place, I do a quick visual scan to make sure I've left nothing behind. I don't know how many times this has saved me. Or how I taught myself to do this consistently. I have this same problem except I want to know is how to stop forgetting your coat! I've lost 3 coats this week adding up to $300 or so. This is just insane and it's like it's impossible to stop. Like no matter how much I try to remember I forget it within a week! Worst part is I can never even remember when I lost it I just suddenly notice that I don't have it.  Oh I've done that quite a few times. Even forgot groceries once. Now what I do is maintain physical contact with the bag, if I put it down, I'll have my legs pressed against it not to forget that it's there. If it's my backpack, I'll always have my hand or my arm through one of the straps. Keep the bags on her body at all times. It should always be sitting in her lap or have the loop around her in a way she wouldn't forget/slip out of. If shes carrying multiple bags (laptop case, purse) consider getting a single bag to carry everything in, and keep that bag on your lap.  Only once actually, a bag with brand new expensive winter boots.

Luckily I could go and get them at the bus office, yay Denmark.  do you mean so the strap goes  across your chest diagonally? 

yes, this works :)

&#x200B; No, I will sit and for example have a book in my hands and one arm goes through the loop with the bag sitting next to me. Same works with a foot if the bag is down on the ground
