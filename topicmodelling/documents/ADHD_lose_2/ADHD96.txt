Biggest hygiene issues? What are the struggles you have with hygiene as an adult with ADHD? Is it forgetting to floss or see the dentist, putting off laundry till all your clothes are dirty? Scratching your butthole and then forgetting to wash your hands and then rubbing your eye and getting pinkeye? Running out of soap and then forgetting to buy more for a month? I WANNA KNOW  Laundry and flossing for sure.

If I'm honest, it's everything some of the time. yes all of that and more     
     
And forgetting to change my tampon as often as I should. Once I feel a leak that's my cue. I wish I could be more preemptive/proactive. I've been having my period for 12 years and somehow I still  don't have it figured out.  Yes.

Evening brushing my teeth and the house in general. Washing my hands in general. I know I should do it but I tend to forget it quite often. The only time I do not forget to do it is when I'm baking/cooking. Sometimes I don’t bathe or brush teeth and I’m a girl. It just felt like a routine and my procrastination just makes me leave all these troublesome tasks to the end or not do it at all.  Laundry and showering. I love showering but I hate that I have to blowdry and style my hair afterwards so I put it off and put it off. I wish I was just pretty enough to not need to put in so much work every time. It's a pain and it eats up so much time.
