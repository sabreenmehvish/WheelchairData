The car key trick: I lifesaver for always forgetting things at work (and anywhere else) I am notorious for getting lunch at work, putting the leftovers in the office fridge so I can finish the rest for dinner later, and then forgetting it when I leave (usually over the weekend too)

&#x200B;

So I started doing this trick - when I put my leftovers in the fridge, I also put my car keys on top of the box. I obviously can't leave the office without my car, so usually I'll do the usual pat all 4 pockets to see where they are and then immediately remember I need to go get them out of the fridge along with my leftovers.

At first my coworkers would take my car keys out and leave them on my desk like "hey.... found these in the fridge...?" but after I explained the purpose they'd laugh and usually start going the same.

It's a bit silly, but so useful. I use this trick all the time for other things I don't want to forget when I leave somewhere (and need to leave with my car) You know the rules: If it sounds stupid but it works, then it is not stupid. I tried putting stuff with my purse and would forget it anyway, so now, I put it on top of my purse.   Once in awhile, I will still move the stuff off the purse, set it down and forget it, but it usually works for me. That's so genious.  <3

 I remember to take my meds in a similar way to this. I leave my car keys, meds, and wallet next to each other every day. Just so I literally can't forget to take them.  This is a wonderful ADHD life hack. Thank you! I put my meds on top of my wallet so that I can't get out of the house without remembering to them in the morning. I do this in the morning; my wallet, phone and work pass all get put with my keys so I donâ€™t forget them.  First time I tried a trick like this, I didn't have car keys for three days.

I also try to set things with my keys so I can grab them both... but I generally just end up plucking the item in question off my keys and then grabbing my keys as most of my attention is on where I am going  and how to get there Hahaha same here! I prepare something for myself and then get distracted, move it aside and leave without it:D cheers I second this, I love it!
