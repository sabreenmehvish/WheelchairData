RIP to everything I wanted to look up because it seemed interesting, but never did because I forgot And all the times I suddenly remember that there was *something* I wanted to look up but I can never remember it. Don't worry, you'll be having a really deep conversation with someone, remember it then, and completely forget what you're talking about. I leave so many tabs open on my phone and I still don't remember to go back to them All the songs I shazamed and then forgot to look them up later. My therapist recommended I use a Distraction Log and it's great. If something pops up in my head while I'm trying to get stuff done, if the temptation isnt too strong, I can jot down in the log and get back to what I'm doing. When I get a free minute, my distraction log is a treasure trove of cool shit to nerd out on.   
It's only really practical when Ive got a good handle on steering my focus, but it's occasionally helpful and helps my cluttered ass feel at least a little organized.  I have a note on my phone of stuff to Google.
I always forget to look at it, but it's there. Let us have a moment of silence......so I heard this thing on the radio the other day about ancient grains and how they have lower gluten than or modern grains and so I was thinking about planting quinoa in my backyard but I'm not sure my landlord would be cool with it any tips?  I feel you. I've been adding Reddit posts to my saved list for 3 years and someday I WILL go back and review it! Look at all the stuff I wanted to "later" read all those amazing articles and watch all those videos. Someday I'm literally looking at reddit right now because by the time I grabbed my phone I forgot what I wanted to look up. Why do I feel called out every time I see a post from this sub. 

I swear to God everything is so relatable My list of saved threads on reddit on this account alone is 19 pages deep.

A moment of silence, please, for all the saved threads on all the accounts I've lost over the years because I forgot the clever passwords I made up just for them... This is the realest shit I've ever read. I started writing them down. I have a whole notebook filled with random words i want to look up. Well it’s still there and i havent started but now i know that i can at anytime. 

Or the notes app on your phone. That’s more convenient  [deleted] I remember for about 2 seconds before I get distracted by something else. The secret is to keep the tab open for several weeks, before either closing it to neaten up or briefly scan the article before going on an unrelated Wikipedia binge.  The number of times I’ve opened 

Oh wow. ...was gonna say number of times I’ve opened safari only to have forgotten what I was gonna google...


Buttttt I went downstairs and took my medicine and did the dishes...   and came back upstairs, opened my phone to google something...   which I have now forgotten bc I saw the 6 words of this unfinished post 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️

Not kidding at all All the things I told myself not to forget where I put them... I started keeping notes of movies I want to watch, like when I go to watch a movie I can't think of anything that I wanted to watch.  I constantly save cool things to Pinterest  and Pocket because it takes just a second or two to swipe them there. It helps scratch that distraction itch because I know it will be there later, when I have time. It’s digital hoarding but it works for me. 

 Oh, I look them up! And research them in depth! And then retain nothing that I have learned! Yayyyyyy!!! RIP, knowledge!!! I keep a list of things on my phone, so if I’m ever bored, I have fodder Or start looking it up and immediately lose interest. That is me. Either lose interest right away or as soon as I get good enough that I could start making money doing it.  wow this is the most relatable thing i think i’ve ever read! lol Will those barriers on those 6 story + overpasses really keeps me from going over the edge if someone crashes into me going 75mph? How about those between lanes?
I still don’t know and quite frankly I think because I don’t want to know the answer.  This statement hurts because it’s true. I'm trying to develop a habit of keeping paper notes to combat exactly this phenomenon. I have too many ideas that are a flash in the pan but gone the moment I try to recall them. From now on, every time something like that occurs to me, I write it down in my homebrew planner. I make lots of notes to my self, send myself emails, leave many tens of browser tabs open across multiple browsers and devices... and as soon as something else comes along I just ignore all of these.  :( This happens to me every day )-: I need to write it down  Hahahaha I feel this so hard  RIP to the file of unopened saves Facebook reminds me about on a daily basis My wife thinks I'm nuts when I do something late at night. If I dont do it when its fresh on my mind it wont get done. Notepad on my phone helps some but a thought can be grand one minute and gone the next. forgetting something moments ago is THE WORST. so frustrating. but can be seen as positive bc people i talk to are usually quite understanding that my memory is shit and dont get upset when i ask them to repeat whay they said lol I can't relate to this more. There's so much I want to research and talk about with someone but I can never remember what it was when the time comes.  I was just thinking about this quirk last night! Sometimes I’ll drop everything to do a quick google because I know I’ll forget if I don’t, but that runs the risk of what I stopped doing being forgotten instead! Damned if you, damned if you don’t. 

At work, I try and keep scrap paper on hand to jot down “stuff to do later” when things like that come to mind, and that kind of helps.  I manage to get to the "Google/look up" stage but not the "read the page" stage.  This is why I have like 400 tabs opened on my phone, laptop, and desktop computers. Don't worry, the other night my boyfriend showed me an alpaca gif right before he went to sleep. I spent the next 2 hours researching alpacas, then llamas, then following a bunch of llama breeders on Facebook. Yes I went to sleep at 3am. Yes I hate myself I had no idea this was so common among ADHD/ADD folks. What is it about us that drives this insatiable curiosity/thirst for knowledge? I have so many tabs open and so many things added to my reading list, all of which I rarely go back to because “not now, something else has my attention that seems more interesting (or pressing).” I also forget what it was I wanted to look into 5 minutes after the thought strikes.  This post reminded me I was supposed to text someone to arrange to meet up three months ago 🙈 RIP everything I was supposed to do when I got distracted by that thing I wanted to look up and then read about for hours on end because of impulsivity and an inability to keep track of time.. F I write that stuff down so I can remember it then I always forget to check that I wrote it down. +1 Movies, books, tv shows, new restaurants...

I tried to keep a notepad by the TV to jot down what I want to try but kept procrastinating. Shocker!  Backtrack your previous thoughts. If you get wind of one you can often follow it to the one after, then the one after, and then finally you remember you were going to google about what difference tyre width makes to rolling resistance in cars.  In class i found my self looking up the likelihood my heart stops beating and i go into cardiac arrest. That was an interesting trip down the rabbit hole.  Haha you just reminded me of something I meant to look up the other day. Thanks! Psssh, cut it out. You're makin' me sad man. The only thing I *won't* forget, unfortunately enough, is all the times I *reeeeally* need to do something *exceeeedingly* important.. and. just. couldn't. remember. >_<!

&nbsp;

Like.. "Hmm.. i vaguely remember there was something I was supposed to do today.. Ah, oh well."

::Continues driving home from work as nuclear powerplant reactors begin to meltdown:: That literally happened when I was gonna see if this subreddit existed I just remembered to look it up -*takes off cowboy hat*-

-*pays respects*- I'm saving this post so I can always remember it and come look at it later.  Don’t forgot about the things you did get to look up, but forgot you learned... This is so annoyjng! The amount of stuff i save on reddit to read later on and everytime I forget  Try carrying a notebook around with you. One that you like, with no rules. Write anything and everything in there. I feel you'll find it helps with your memory a bit. And it may help with self reflection as well :) I have a “To Google” list that just gets longer and longer as time passes. I’m a curious cat and have too many racing thoughts and interests so I decided to make the list so I can at least come back to it one day. 

Edit: I haven’t been diagnosed with ADHD but I am taking medication for Bipolar II. During my manic states, my thoughts and whims go a mile a minute.  Right now I'm trying to go through my massive amount of bookmarked pages and get what I wanted from them. ...So many askreddit threads I thought would be cool to read later...

Now I keep a little journal that I jot down stuff in for things I want to look up later or keep in mind. I'm trying to write a story and it's worked out really well for me-- no more cool ideas at 2am forgotten by morning! Lets celebrate the life of what you looked up instead of grieving the death of the lost idea. Flip anything to make it positive lol Just write it down in the bullet journal you misplaced last month!  

(Also, out of the loop here. What's with the stream of 8i8's) Lmao me. It’s the worst when I’m driving and I can’t write it down and my head is all OVER the place with ideas or things to look up  I was at work read this, and tabbed out, tabbed back in and was like where the hell am I? Google Keep changed my life I signed up for 8 free online classes to learn new things when I was bored. Never made it past the first week. Never forget.
Oh, wait. Or you do look it up and don't absorb a single piece of information. That's my life.  RIP to all the awesome sketch ideas I forgot later. Sad news. It’s what I get for not having a notebook or something. I always forget that too.  I keep a text file on my desktop called "search" for this very purpose.

I also have a note taking app with a "search" list.

Try it. Rip to every time I rememberrd what i had to google, but got distracted by all the articles under the search bar on the google app 😭 I screenshot everything I ever want to look up, then I forget to look it up. About 8 times a year I have a random free day at work and discover all of these amazing links/things in my photos.  That’s why my tabs register as a :) on Google Chrome. So many things I’ve googled, just to forget about and never look at again.  You've just reminded me that I've been meaning to look something up for days! I have a thousand open tabs of google searches that I'll have a look at later but never do.  Yup. That's extremely relatable. Furthermore, RIP to any thoughts I've had during a simple, casual conversation that I lost mid-sentence that leaves me staring blankly at the person and apologizing for not being able to keep up.  I can already see the eye rolls coming my way as I go to think of an answer to some question one of my friends ask me, only to look off into space and suddenly get all excited to tell them about something completely random and unconnected that I had been meaning to research earlier. 

I can practically feel their disappointment and my own slight embarrassment as I realize they don't care at all and would prefer I finish answering the question...but I totally forgot what it was and have to ask them to repeat it. Probably not for the first time. Oh, they just love that...Really makes them "feel heard". Can't blame them, it's pretty shitty that I do that all the time. I somehow just can't seem to help it. This is so relatable it’s almost painful. Lol. I always have random shit triggering memories I forgot that I even had, and then they just vanish back into the abyssal void that is my mind without warning.  This is why I still take my meds even when I'm not working or trying to get stuff done.  I do better actually holding a conversation.  Otherwise, I do this.  The poor souls who have to listen to me ramble...bless their hearts.   How do you know my life? 0_0 [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] I feel like you are attacking me.  THIS!!!! This is my tribe. You are my peeps. Hug. [removed] Fuuuuuck my life 😂 my bf is always on my ass about my millions of tabs on my phone and computer. He tells me to bookmark and he doesn't believe me when I tell him that I will literally never look at them again if I do.  I have a system in which I only leave two important tabs open in my browser at any time. Then I use the third one to search or whatever.  And you accidentally closed all of them and never remember the website you open. 

On desktop, you'll be spamming ctrl+shift+t I have ~200 Chrome tabs open.  I *always* shut down the wrong way so the session will restore - just in case.

Only now that I'm medicated have I been able to slowly go through them and actually close *some* of 'em. I save bookmarks and send myself stuff on messenger, and never remember it. But sometimes I go back for an unrelated reason and see it! ME TOO!!! It’s insane lol
Fun fact:
Once you hit 100 tabs, Chrome mobile shows you a happy face.  At least on iPhone and with Apple Music you can connect Apple Music to Shazam so that any song you Shazam is automatically added to your library. I’m not sure if this can be done with Spotify or Android You can link Shazam to Spotify!! It's the best thing ever A few hundred on my current phone. Now I can't forget, but the amount has made it into a chore so I'm just as fucked. Great idea! I'm taking this idea.  A distraction log would be perfect for finding things to read during forced downtime with nothing to do. I have a list for this on my phone. Occasionally I stumble across it and realise it only ever gets added to, never actioned. "...if the temptation isn't too strong..." feels like its always too strong lmao I tried doing that, but writing was too slow and would also distract me. lol SO, what's been working well for me now is I grabbed one of our old pre-Android safety Tracfones and use it ONLY as a voice recorder (ok, so maybe sometimes for the calculator, too). 
It felt silly at first, but it has been REALLY helpful, actually! Evernote has been a lifesaver as far as jotting down random stuff in the moment so I don't forget it. Still working on the going back part haha  Tell your landlord that hes a dork and do it anyway Use planters. Then the yard isn’t torn up. Use planters. Then the yard isn’t torn up. My retirement will just be me reading thousands of saved items. Me too. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Reddit only saves 1,000 of them. Every new saved item deletes an older one and I never get the chance to go back and look at the older stuff. This leads to countless open tabs and a bloated bookmark list.  No shit? Had no clue I could save things. I always leave my phone open at the spot I'm reading and then the next time I unlock my phone I have to remember why I wanted to read it. Hahaha I open instagram instinctively when half the time I only got my phone out because I needed yo urgently check google maps or call someone or write something down. 100 pictures later.... ooops missed my stop again and have no idea where I'm supposed to be. Lol I'm literally browsing and thinking the same thing, hah! Evernote syncs across devices if you're constantly between a phone, computer and tablet like I tend to be.

Edit: my bad, only two devices for free. But it's still a really good app and nice to have it backed up unlike the notes app.  Erm, you wouldn't happen to know where I left my notebook, would you? Also, can I borrow a pen? Dude, just sport a rad fannypack or travel journal sling pouch! 
I've been using my old hardware apron from Home Depot that we painted in youth group 15 years ago around the house. lol ... I put them in a safe place so I wouldn't loose them, now I can't remember where that was.... or what I was looking for.  bahaha, right? Unfortunately my solution is usually just ghosting FB until I forget about that.  Yo, you must be my male doppelganger. I've started using an old TracFone just as a voice recorder because it is quicker and less interrupting of what I was doing when those 10 thoughts came up. Baby steps. lol Oh, btw, are you also always the person on a trip that stays up the night before departure making sure everything is packed and ready to go so you can be the last one out of bed in the morning cus all your friends have the ability to do all of that in a short time, and get dressed, all after waking up and not be late for check-out and are trying not to bitch you out with your lights and sounds all over the place and they're all trying to sleep? Story of my life. lol TIME IS THE PROBLEMMMMMM F Or lose the notebook/ paper I didn't know I had a twin out there. 88888888888888888888 Me too. Meds make it easier to deal with people in general, for me anyway. And also so I don't talk a million miles a minute :). [removed] Steamworks DRM bye bye [removed] I was going to say this too kind of.  I tend to think of something and then hurry up and open a tab so I don’t forget.  Then next time I open the browser I try to look at the tabs I don’t always remember to though but then if i do actually remember then I usually have a hard time remembering why i opened it anyway.  

I have a lot of bookmarks too...... but not sure why I saved a lot of them lol  i think bookmarking makes me feel safe and that it'll always be there even if i dont remember to revisit lol I do the same thing to my boyfriend!

I've always had a laptop that couldn't handle many tabs being open, at least until I got my desktop, that is. So maybe that's why it bothers me so much, but I regularly joke about having an invervention for him! 😂 HOW Reminds me of an ADHD analogy I saw on this sub once: "ADHD is like my internet browser: I have 50 tabs open, 3 are frozen, and I have no idea where the music is coming from." Yeah my shazam playlist on Spotify is a great list of songs I liked and forgot about.  That’s a pretty good data point and kind of useful if you can trick yourself into thinking they weren’t followed up on because they just weren’t that important.  Identifying distractions as distractions is hard enough. That’s supposed to be the goal of the list. Look at it later, try to pull the important stuff out, and get a sense of ‘when I wander here, my focus and control are slipping’. 

As with 99% of the tips, hacks, and treatments on here, easier said than done AF.  Very fair. I often forget about it unless I use a sticky note or a notes app. Even then though, avoiding distractions by having a list of interesting distractions visible also poses its own issues. If it was easy, we wouldn’t chat about it here.  Although I heartily agree, I've done this in the past with other "projects" and he weren't too pleased. Yep, this is most certainly the plan.  Yeah but you gotta pay for it to do that right? Fortunately I let my wife pack. I'm the one who has to grow out their beard bc I forgot my beard trimmer.  Make that Triplets  [removed] Exactly this! My husband hates when I say it’s bookmarked cuz there are sooooo many to scroll through  I just use OneTab now. Rarely do I ever actually look at my bookmarks, so I've just come to terms with keeping everything I would've bookmarked, or when I get to the point that I'm getting overwhelmed and there are no longer any letters to guess which tab is what, and keep a running page of everything. Occasionally I'll block like items together, at least for that day, and Star and Lock certain pages that I may never use but know would be perfect for things that I do if needed. It's really just a comfort thing. OneTab has done to me and browsing what Pinterest did with my shopping and overspending habit. lol 
Only thing about it is that to look at those tabs again, you have to send yourself the link to that page on whichever device you are on (ie, no syncing). On boyfriend's desktop right now and currently sitting at 5225 links. 
Side note, apparently there is a limit to adding all your YouTube vids to "Watch Later", cus I hit that capacity a few days ago. lol Same, I always think that I will find my way back to it when I need to... This is part of what kept me coming back to professionals and asking to be tested! Took me almost six years to be taken seriously, but at least I'm here.  :) Lmfao this is so accurate because I end up forgetting about the songs I put there Soundhound also supports this I usually try to let myself forget about it. Even if I do look it up, ill completely forget everything I read about 10 minutes later Nope, I've never paid a dime.  You could use Google keep! I use Google keep  Quads? OneTab liberated my life.

I reached having not one, but two Toblerone browser windows, when I finally turned to OneTab. I call it Toblerone phase because the tabs have no place for letters or icons anymore, it's just a row of tab triangles. Yes, it happened enough times to get a name. Doesn’t it cost to have Evernote sync on more than 2 devices? I’ll check it out! Quintuplets??? Oh, yeah you're right. I got confused about how many you can have connected. My bad.
