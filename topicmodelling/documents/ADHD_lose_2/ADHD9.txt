I love podcasts, but I have to rewind them so goddamn much because I completely zone out and forget I'm even listening to a podcast shoutout to Casefile by the way I have the same problem with TV...  I will be "watching" TV with  my wife--I am facing the screen, my eyes are on it but my brain is elsewhere.  I don't realize it until she laughs or responds to what is going on, then I have to ask her to tell me what just happened .  She's pretty patient with it but I know it must get pretty annoying. Same. I can't listen to anything super story based like Nightvale unless I'm feeling particularly focused (it comes and goes for me, you know?) because I'll miss the whole thing. I’m the opposite. I play them on 1.5 speed because I always feel like I never have enough time.  I love them too, I also often zone out but I found that even though I wasn't listening, my ears still were, so it's as if I can play back what was said in my head and I can remember even though I was thinking about something entirely different. This is only if I zone out for a small amount of time. 
(Or I may just be missing chunks of the podcasts and just think I know what's happening)

I also find listening to podcasts while driving helpful for paying attention to driving, and actually listening to the podcasts.  This sounds like exactly why I don't like podcasts. Night Vale is the worst of this for me. 

Probably due to the subject matter and the incongruous lines and jokes. You can zone out for 30 seconds and be totally lost. 

Non-fiction is much easier to follow.

I also listen to almost all of them around 1.7x speed, unless it’s Twenty Thousand Hertz or Night Vale or something else involving sound.  Augh yes yes. The only way I can listen to one is if I'm drawing at the same time, or driving (or otherwise doing an "easy" task with my hands). I can't watch TV for the same reason. 

My teachers would go so mad at me when I was in school because I was constantly drawing. That was the only way I could focus though! Oof. Same. I usually tune into Phillip DeFranco every day on commute from work since it's a drive. I'll get so distracted by my own thoughts and everything else I'll miss a topic or THREE...then have to start it over. Hate it. I was just listening to an episode of sword and scale the other day. One second, they’re talking about something random, the next thing I know, they’re calling the husband to tell him his wife and daughter were dead! I listened and skipped back seriously, at least 5 times, still couldn’t stay focused enough to catch the part about finding the bodies.  I have this problem but when listening to music. I restart a song at least 3 times because I zoned out  Hey, I love Casefile!

True Crime podcasts in general require a medium amount of attention from me, while comedy or interviews (like WTF) are generally low-attention. So if I half need to focus, like while working, I’ll gravitate towards comedy or politics (until it gets too depressing). If I have more attention span, like running or cleaning, then I like to catch up on true crime or stories (like You Must Remember This).

No matter what, if I’m reading something I can’t listen to words at the same time, so I’ll pause or switch to Spotify for music.

But damn do I love me some podcasts :) Haha agreed! I’m either all in like it’s an episode of Jerry Springer, or I start thinking about what makes someone start a pod cast in the first place, and oh sweet that squirrel looks fat as shit 😂 Yeah, had the same problem with Game of Thrones....Wait. Is that a new character? Or an old character I forgot about. Fucking hell it's not just me then.

They are like water to me - i.e. they fall on my ears and down my shoulders.

Whilst I love the *idea* of podcasts, I have to have a transcript in order to understand them. Was the same with lectures at a previous university. Completely lost on me. I have found I can only focus on audio when I'm doing a task like ironing or I'm running or similar. My body needs to be engaged but it can't be anything I need to have a mental running commentary about, like sorting. What are some of your favorite podcasts?? This happens to me every day in the car. Literally me listening to Last Podcast on the Left.  I  watch video podcast cause I can’t listen to podcast I need to see them idk why tho lol 


Also anyone watch or listen to the RT podcast love em  I'm mlistening to Critical Role right now and I just realised how much story I missed out on by browsing reddit... I need the background sound tho or I feel Bad Same! I’m a delivery driver for work so I usually pick a podcast I can zone out on, because I can’t pay attention as well as hopping in and out of the truck every couple minutes. Favorite podcast to not really listen to: Those Conspiracy Guys I listen to podcasts while I play video games, and I mostly listen to humorous ones so the laughter kind of brings me back to reality long enough to enjoy it when something funny happens. I find that I’m paying more attention than I realize, so when the laughter starts I can kind of mentally rewind if that makes any sense. I’m not into most serious podcasts, but when something serious catches my interest, I’ll use it as an excuse to clean or cook or whatever so that I’ll be able to give it my full attention.  I'm just happy I'm not alone I have this post open in three tabs. Out of 150. Bruhhhhhhhhh! That is so me! I annoy myself with this on a daily basis... "I love podcasts! I just put them on in the background while I'm doing something else."

"Oh. That must be nice for you. Hm." Ever listen to the "Faster than normal" podcast... he has ADHD and can keep your attention, since he has to keep his. I was thinking about this the other day. I started listening to "Welcome to Night Vale" a few weeks ago and I have to constantly rewind during an episode. I always use subtitles when I watch Netflix because I find it easier to focus that way, so I looked up transcripts for the podcast. It's really not helping as much as I thought it would though, because my eyes just skip over words before they've been said yet, so I have to backtrack You spirit animal, you. I will watch the clips of popular podcasts like H3 and J.R.E. before listening to an entire show just so I can have a frame of reference and my ears know what to listen for.  haha i am the same! Glad it's not just me! 

Also, the NYT's 'Caliphate' was amazing. Ha! I like them, too. 

But every night, before I can fall asleep, I stop the constant thoughts from churring in my head by listening to a lecture with ear phones. (And, yes I do wake with them wrapped round me;-)

The Oxford Anthropology lectures a great [https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/anthropology](https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/anthropology)

&#x200B; Saaaaaame. I can only listen to them when I’m doing something. I listen while going for walks, driving, and working on something that doesn’t take too much thought (art, crochet, at work.) I think the only time I was able to listen to a podcast while doing nothing was when I was listening to the adventure zone for the first time when I had a concussion. And that’s because any other activities made me dizzy. Yeah I only listen 15 minutes at a time for that reason. Set a sleep timer for 15 minutes concentrate really hard for that time and then go and do something else. YES! Lol! I’ve been listening to a cool podcast for the last hour... but your comment snapped me out of a good 15 minute reddit vortex I didn’t even know I was in... and now I can’t remember any of the cool shit that was going on in the podcast and have to rewind it. 

Sigh. This shit is real... I feel like I’m wrestling against it in every moment. It’s exhausting. 

Meds help win the fight each day, but they just defer the exhaustion.  :-/ Too real. How much of my life have I wasted rewinding in increments of 15 seconds to find where I zoned out? Some times i just give up and skip the rest of the podcast or episode and move to the next one I'm glad y'all can relate.  Something that I found helps keep me focused is to do something with my hands while listening at the same time. For example, I work as a janitor in my dorm and, while I'm cleaning, I always listen to my favorite podcast. When I clean, it helps me focus better on what I'm listening to. I often listen to them when I’m cleaning (literally doing both of this right now at 10 pm but I’m taking a well deserved break) or when I’m out running errands. It takes off my mind from the distractions when I’m out in the city center, and it also takes the boredom away from being in public transport. I tend to wander off from the story lol (sometimes over analyze about the things that were discussed in the podcast) and I have to rewind them often as well :( 

P.S. For those who are interested in investigative journalism/true crime podcasts, I’m currently obsessed with In The Dark.  OMG same here! I usually listen to them at work so I can stay focused . But once my mind starts wandering on to other things it's like listening to the teacher from The Peanuts. "Whah whah whah" . Once I snap out of it, I realized that I completely missed half the show. Sometimes ,it takes me 2 hours to finish a one hour show because of how distracted i get in my own head. I hate it I can't you sit and listening to something, my mind will start to wander for the lack of stimulation.  This is me As a 36 year old with ADD I called those books  I think podcasts are a wonderful idea. We all have times where we tune out of episodes, be it radio, music, tv etc. if found myself relying waaaay too much on tv to fill time and that’s not a good thing for my brain as I’m just sitting and concentrating on the screen but not using my brain. I find with podcasts you can try to be productive, move around and maybe get a few things done and still take things in to a certain degree. Obviously the level of interest in the podcast will dictate how much you actually take in but I find they’re a lot more useful in everyday life. Much like if you can’t find something to watch on tv, you’ll chuck on something you’ve already watched and leave it as background noise and tune out, you could either do that with a podcast, or you can get lost in the world of focus, listening to something good. It’s obviously circumstantial person to person but I find you can take in a lot more than reading books or tv. 

Unstructured chat/rant over 😂 That's the reason I listen to podcasts most of the time, I don't care about missing stuff. Almost all of the media I consume is stuff that doesn't require my full attention. Audiobooks are the worst for me, I rewind those constantly and will be completely lost if I don't.
 I do this when people are talking. Except there’s no rewind, and there’s a strict limit on wait.. what?’s you can use in a conversation before things get really awkward.  I like to listen to podcasts while I work. It isn't efficient. There's a lot of rewinding and revising. On the plus side you always find a scene you didn't know in movies you watched a dozen times. That's why I love podcasts I can just tune in and out of, like my brother my brother and me.  You don't have to pay attention because they're not saying anything important and no matter where you start paying attention again, it'll still be funny.

I exclusively listen to things I want to pay attention to when I'm driving because then I have to pay attention to the road.  Driving alone is so boring I end up drifting off into lala land, but when I have something else I can focus on that doesn't require my eyes, I can focus better on both. I was going to type "sure you don't have ADHD?" then i looked at the subreddit. Yup, that's a nice reminder. Same except I get distracted by something else I do something when I listen to them. Coloring, cross stitching, wash dishes. It really helps to stay focused. Speed them suckers up to about 1.8x speed.  Then the words finally come fast enough for me to focus on 'em.

(start at 1.2 or so and work your way up - it can be disorienting at first) Me too, I don’t listen to them unless I’m in the right mood. I do often listen to podcast I don’t mind zoning out on to go to sleep. It puts me right out. Even worse, I have to listen to phone calls as part of my job. I’m only listening for certain things and I’m so bad about zoning out and missing it. The app we use has squiggly sound wave/voice data and now I’m really good about just finding the parts I need from that so I don’t have to start over.  I find it’s easier to listen to podcasts when I’m not doing something else. Like if I try to read or pay attention *anything* while I’m listening to a podcast, even for anything more than like 30s, I lose maybe 5 mins of the podcast. 

I try to actively focus on the podcast when I’m listening to it. Try closing your eyes or wearing noise canceling headphones.

Idk if that helps, but it usually works for me to help zone out less than when I don’t do it. #MyWholeLife Really? I zone into the podcast and forget how I got to work. This is why I don't do story/narrative podcasts but random ones like No Such Thing As a Fish where even if I'm lost for a few minutes when I jump back in it's still just brand new interesting facts I find that i can only focus on something if im doing three things at a time, i’m at peak efficiency when im listening to a podcast, playing a game and eating That’s why I listen to podcasts with wireless headphones while I clean the house and I too fall asleep when watching Netflix.  SAME. I watch the same podcasts so often, because I didnt listen the first time. Sometimes I just pit podcasts on as background noise. I'll play it, but I'll keep pausing it every 5-10 mins (for 10-30mins) because I keep remembering that random thing I wanted to Google. I just listen to podcasts where I find the hosts' voices to be pleasant but maybe the content isn't so interesting to me (mostly guys shooting the shit). I end up having to rewind on stuff like The Adventure Zone sometimes but I appreciate their summary kinda things at the top of the show. I just begin from the sentence that i zone back into :) much much easier The "ten seconds back" button is used liberally that is for sure.

Though I find that when I get in the groove of listening I can usually stick with it, at least until a new chapter/subject starts and I am stuck thinking about the previous one.

&#x200B;

Audiobooks and Podcasts are amazing though. Dude I gave up on podcast a long time ago for that very reason.  Me too. I have the same problem with audiobooks. Shoutout to the ADHD podcast, seriously shout out! This happens to me with everything. Books, podcasts, music sometimes, television for sure. I hear the words but I can't process them always-even intently. I'm usually sucked into a different part of the movie or podcast momentarily and stuck on some runaway thought missing what came after the thought burst in. In conversation, same thing. Meds help significantly but by the time I'm watching movies and/or reading or whatever in the evening the meds have worn off.  I do this thing where I’ll be listening and they say something interesting and I sit and ruminate on it for like two minutes and forget that the podcast is moving on lol I do the same thing when I read and/or listen to music because a words triggers a whole slew of thoughts and 20 min later i realise what im Accually doing. YES!!!! A THOUSAND TIMES YES!!!!

I do the same with audiobooks. And reading. I'll read a paragraph and forget what I was reading. I don't have ADD but I do that all the time. I feel like you can just tell when people are saying anything interesting by the tone of their voice or when they're just babbling on about non-sense. If their voice doesn't catch my attention I just skim through it I have had to rewind the same episode four or more times in a row because I keep zoning out and missing the same piece of information.  I can only watch T.V. well if I'm simultaneously doing something with my hands, like crochet or whatever.
I can only listen to podcasts when I'm for example, cycling on the street. I couldn't do it at home, I'd get too distracted. I guess when I'm cycling, my mind wanders (although in traffic I do whatever I can not to let it) but I can't impulsively grab another thing to do like I can at home. That helps. Still, even on the bike I miss parts. Hahaha, same! I listen to them while doing boring tasks so I can focus on something interesting, but when I'm walking I forget... I've started listening to podcasts at 1.5-2x the speed bc if it goes more quickly it captures my attention more, I wonder if this would work for you! You're doing it right. This is why I can never catch up to Hello From the Magic Tavern. DUDE YES ALL DAY EVERYDAY. I love podcast they’re my favorite form of entertainment. BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANT JUST LISTEN ONCE WITHOUT REWINDING. idk if you can tell but this hit home  I’ll start by saying I’m a highly auditory individual. I learn best by listening to conversations. 

That said what works for me is listening to it at just below double speed. Anything slower than that I can’t keep my attention because it takes too long for anyone to say anything. 

I use overcast and they have great features that reduces the distortion of speeding it up. It has a nice feature that illuminates gaps where there is silence. 

Just my two cents. You might do this and still not be able to rewind. Some podcasts are too dense for me. So each one has its own speed.  Yep. Can relate.

30 minute podcast? lol, it takes 2 hour to listen to the whole thing because I constantly have to go back xD I only started being able to listen to podcasts once I got medicated and figured out to do visual art while listening.  As long as I'm keeping my eyes busy with something that doesn't involve language, I  don't have any problems sticking with it.   As soon as I don't though, my mind wanders and I lose the whole thing.

Driving can work too, but art is the best.  Bonus: it makes my art better too! Same. I always just chalk this up to the podcast being boring, not a symptom of my own issues. This is why I haven't bothered trying podcasts. They can't hold my full attention because it's only auditory, which guarantees that I'll end up getting distracted and not hearing a word and have to rewind over and over again.

I'm bad enough forgetting I'm watching a video and flipping to a different tab, I can't even imagine if there wasn't even video to try to hold my attention! Podcasts have sort of helped me utilize my attention issues effectively. I have a constant need for stimulation which it satisfies and a ceaseless, running mind which it occupies when doing passive activities that I usually find difficult to stay focused on. For example, I now look forward to making myself a nice breakfast in the morning because I get to listen to podcasts at the same time and engage my mind productively by learning new things (I almost always listen to educational/political podcasts). This might not work for everyone but it certainly helps me get all of my mindless chores out of the way. Perhaps it's unfortunate that I haven't eased my need for stimulation or learned to curb the momentum of my thoughts but my life has improved nonetheless.  i listen to them twice because otherwise i wouldn’t get all the information lol The only podcast I can listen to is JennaJulien's podcast. I just don't have the attention span for most podcasts Is this a classic symptom of ADHD or ADD? Hello guys I read a good book on how to focus and yeah sure i know everyone heres this book or this medicine this that but give it a try . Switch On Your Brain by Dr. Caroline Leaf I'll do the same. Be watching it, listening, etc. Then something will be said, I'll be aware that words were said but have no clue what was actually said, even though I could hear them fine. My husband is very patient in repeating things too. Yay for spouses who are understanding! Same. Ever since I was a kid I would play a little game after every commercial (with streaming now its anytime I pause and leave the room). Before the show would come back on I’d try and guess what I was just watching and would almost always come up blank.  If you haven't yet, turn on closed caption, that way you're engaged in what is on because you'll automatically start reading it.  We do it at home.  Not only does it prevent the "I didn't understand what they just said", it also helps to prevent you from not paying attention. Subtitles help.  Oh yes!:( 
„Ehm sorry I lost track. who is „NameOfPersonThatApperedForThe3Time”?” Doing something with my hands really helps a lot. If it's a movie or something in a theater I bring quiet fidget toys, and for stuff at home I like to fish in WoW in the background or work on something like doodling. Is this a classic symptom of ADHD or ADD? Closed captioning!!! I can watch so man shows now without getting distracted -- especially those HBO dramas with a lot of quiet talking. I thought it'd be annoying but now I can't watch TV without it. This is why I love watching sports.  You can zone out for 5 minutes straight and then BAM, back into the game!  They have announcers and the score is right there on the screen and it's easy to go from zoning out to watching it. I'm the opposite with TV. It's one of the few things that can so completely occupy my brain it's a bitch to draw my attention away. I do this with books.  I'll be 5-6 pages in and realize that I've been daydreaming the whole time.  Didn't do quite a few book reports in school because of that.   Is this a classic symptom of ADHD or ADD? As paradoxical as it seems, listening faster helps me focus better. I think because it forces me to use more of my brain to pay attention and I don't have an opportunity to lose focus if someone's talking slowly I do this with lectures cause they're so boring otherwise.  Same at 1.8x.

I started at 1.25x and gradually increase to 1.8x. Terrible for podcasts with singing, or laughter (Reply All I'm looking at you) This whole "sub thread" is so funny, I was going to suggest speeding up the podcast.  Even though I'm mega inattentive ADD I can really focus on reading & read insanely fast.  As a result,  TV & movies can get boring to me bc they move too slowly.  Podcasts are ok bc I don't have to watch them, obviously, so I can multitask.   Yep, I did this for the longest. After a while I just couldn't anymore because I just couldn't take it. I have trouble paying attention to anything informational under 2x, for audio ideally 3x. 1x and my mind is immediately elsewhere. Yeah, I wish I could control this more. Maybe it’s all the weed but used to be much better at this. wow Same, I cannot focus on them for the life of me and I don't understand how people have the attention spans for them lol I'm starting to sound like a broken record, and I'm not a spammer, but try watching TV with Closed Caption on.  It'll force you to pay attention because you're reading it. Better than missing a traffic light or three.  Is this a classic symptom of ADHD or ADD? Rewind because you didn’t enjoy it hard enough Yeah I'm a sucker for true crime themes, but I can never concentrate enough to listen to every detail going on. And I'm also a sucker for Joe Rogan and Marc Maron, very easy to pay attention too and if you zone out all the time like I do you don't miss much. Hahaha, that has nothing to do with our problem and everything to do with the damn show!  Have you ever tried reading the Wheel of Time series???  Talk about introducing new characters, or reading a chapter on a character that was literally left out of the last 800 page book you just read...  I still haven't finished that series, and at this point in time, I haven't read the series in so long that I'd have to start over... Same. I listen to podcasts while doing mindless tasks like washing dishes and cleaning the kitchen and doing laundry. Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara. 

It’s political commentary, which is not everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s 100x better than watching the news shows. He is calm and quiet. He seems like such a nice, honest, thoughtful, intelligent man. I like hearing his take on current events. And he gives good interviews. He keeps the interviewee on track and explains concepts that may not be known to the listener, and otherwise lets them tell their story. Endless thread, every little thing, science vs, sawbones, reply all, many more that I can't remember but those ones switch topics or move fast enough to keep my brain engaged. Yup! Definitely me if I’m alone listening to the radio in the car. If I’m with someone else the radio has been turned down because I’m trying to focus on the thing they just said. Oh. My. God. I love that podcast! It was actually the one that came to mind while reading this post! So cool to run into someone else who digs it in this forum!  What if you and your wife both have ADHD and you ask "What just happened?" and the other with condescension "Idk, how bout you pay attention" but really both of us have no idea what's going on. Turn on Closed Caption FTW! The only way I can "watch" TV is if I'm doing something else while the TV is on. Usually involving a laptop and Reddit.  Otherwise I'm just staring. I never thought about it prior, but we did the same when we started watching Westworld (where every line is important lol) and I've just left it on since. It makes a world of difference! Knitting helps me so much! I can listen to podcasts so much easier. I WFH and during big meetings where I need to pay attention, I can knit while I listen and it's so much easier to retain things. I've learned I need to have the right combo of visual and auditory to focus.  > or work on something like doodling

Doodling is the only way I got through school and currently get through work meetings. +1 for doodling. This is a false dichotomy since they both refer to the same disorder. ADHD is the modern term whereas ADD is the archaic term. They have never been separate conditions, though both may still be used colloquially.  
  
If you're trying to describe individual variance in hyperactive/inattentive symptoms, that's what the ADHD subtypes are for. ADHD-PI (Primarily Inattentive) is what you'd use to describe someone with few/no hyperactive symptoms.   I think both?  Honestly there is not that huge of a difference between the two. I think ADD mostly but I'm not 100% sure. I have ADD, inattentive type so I'm really spacy when I'm off my meds/during rebound time. I also think regular hormones come to play too because sometimes even when I take my meds I have a hard time focusing. The best time I can listen to a podcast is if I'm doing something relatively mindless like chopping vegetables for dinner or showering because otherwise I'll get distracted. I can't even do my makeup in the morning with a podcast or YouTube video on because it slows me down. Like many people on here I'm late a lot... Wow will have to try this. You could be on to something as I always feel with ADHD that my brain is operating at the "wrong" speed, and that's too far rather than too slow  How so? I just recently started listening to podcasts at work, I find my my job super boring. I have been listening to music for a while but thought I would try podcasts so I might learn some stuff as well. It has been going pretty well so far though I do still zone out occasionally. I listen at home a bit too but have to be doing something else as well such as browsing Reddit, which I am doing right now lol. I do this as well but my family keeps turning it back off That actually makes a lot of sense. I'm going to try that, thank you! I'd say both tbh. both follow a lack of attentiveness. That too  You like legit just described my relationship with my husband to a T.  HahaHahhahaWhaaahaatthefuck? Seems plausible, probably would just be frustrating and/or funny for both!  We usually do have it on actually, it really does help!  Dude.  Subtitles save my life.  They don't help when I'm dinking on my phone or crocheting, but they do wonders for helping keeping things in my brain. (For the most part.  *Some things, such as what someone said at one point in the 11th episode of the 4th season, really doesn't need to be there... it just gets stuck*.) Same! I could never get the hang of knitting but I do cross stitch sometimes. Oh the H part can make a huge difference. Listening to the radio slows me down toooooo!!! I’m somehow slower while doing my makeup so if I need to be on time I shut the d@mn thing off and immediately notice the difference.  Listening to podcasts at the gym has been a life changer for me! I'll throw on something that's an hour or so long and listen to it when I'm lifting weights. If I start a second one and I finish my workout before it's over I'll go on the elliptical or work on a weaker muscle group until it's finished. Watching TV shows is also great for doing cardio! I've been watching West Wing while doing cardio and not allowing myself to watch it anywhere else. It's probably one of the best motivators I've found for going to the gym!  Yes, this exactly. I started thinking of it like other people's attention is like a garden hose, mine is a fire hose. 

Like if I'm in a conversation and truly engaged I'm loud and fast and interrupt too much. Otherwise I have to be doing something else too, like knitting or doodle or fidgeting, something to take the rest of the hose.  We try our best to be patient/supportive/helpful, but thankful there's more of us doing it the hard way out there. It certainly is mostly frustrating. It took me a few years - I started out crocheting though and I think that was easier to pick up! Although that's a hotly debated topic where most people think the "easier" one is whatever one you learned first, but I grasped crochet easier than knitting. 

I LOVE cross stitch but suck at it -- I want to practice though because there are so many great cross stitch patterns now.  I feel like it makes a difference in what behaviours show outwardly, it seems to me people with a hyperactive subtype seem to be more likely to engage in behaviours which are perhaps more obviously destructive so it may be picked up more easily, but when we're talking about subtleties like home leisure activities, it doesn't make that big of a difference. I heard there is even talk of consolidating the subtypes because in reality it's all the same disorder. Off-topic but how long do you lift weights? I only do them for like 11 minutes myself. Just tried the 1.5 speed with John McWhorter's Lexicon Valley, an intellectually stimulating listen at the best of times...it was wild. You should! You can make some really cool stuff for sure. The abundance of pixel art gives you limitless stuff to do if you're not particularly creative like me. I try to keep it under an hour, but I'm generally at the gym anywhere from 45 to 75 minutes. Right now I'm working through Jim Stoppani's Full Body Shortcut to Size program.

If you're just getting started, I'd highly recommend heading to /r/fitness and looking at some of their recommended routines. They're super helpful people and there's plenty of great routines for beginner to veteran lifters. If you don't have the equipment at home to do the workouts and don't have access to a gym, head over to /r/body weight fitness and check out their recommended routine!

If you have any more questions I'm happy to help!  Thanks so much! I appreciate your response, I'm headed over to /r/fitness right now! Awesome! Glad I could help!  Another thing, I had no idea that you don't have/not supposed to lift everyday, that you have to give your muscles time to recuperate. I think I had a question but I forgot it already haha but I think I mainly just wanted to say that. Oh yeah! That really surprised me when I first started lifting. Most of those recommended routines only have you work out 3-4 days a week, and even the ones that have you work out 5 or 6 give plenty of time in between individual muscle groups. 

I think the hardest thing for me is rest haha. I'll get whisked away into some internet rabbit hole and then only be able to get 4 hours of sleep. 

If you want to learn more I highly recommend the bodybuilding.com podcast. Everyone they have on there is an expert in their field or have a ifpb pro card. The most recent episode on nutrition is great!  I'll have to check it out, thanks!

Yeah I know what you mean by rest. I'm usually a night owl myself so I stay up late often. And lately I've been trying to workout in the morning because it's easier that way to just go ahead and get it over with. But it's been tough on my work days because I have to get up super early and it takes a while for me to wake up and get in the swing of things, to be motivated. I can definitely relate. I was talking to a friend about this earlier today, and nowadays I find that if I work out right before work I'm absolutely wiped a few hours later and stay that way until I get a chance to take a nap or something later. If it's feasible you could try to go right after work or later in the evening. The later you go after 7pm or so the less people that are there as well, if that sounds appealing to you. 

Did you find a routine that you think you like?  I think I’m going to keep the same routine of doing it before work. Thankfully I don’t have to go in early every morning!
