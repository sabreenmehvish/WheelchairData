Sometimes when I'm talking, I'll instantaneously lose my train of thought and forget what I was talking about. Is this common w/ ADHD? Always kind of figured it was like early signs of alzheimers, but I'm wondering if it's more related to my attention than my memory. Anyone experience this to some degree? It doesn't happen often, but. 

Shit, where was i? This happens to me, especially when I’m telling stories  Yes it's common. Adhd individuals have working memory issues and that's a symptom of it. Working memory holds all the info you need to do what you are doing in any moment. Like ram from a computer if you will. With adhd if your attention is significantly shifted there is a chance your working memory will fault and basically reset. Leaving you wondering what the fuck you were just doing.  Yes. It’s frustrating because you’ll go down a train of thought and suddenly the tracks will dead end. You have no idea where you were going but then you look back and those tracks have disappeared too so you have no idea where you came from either  If you're a tech nerd, you'll understand my analogy. ADHD is like having a PC with faulty RAM and memory leaks, CPU which will overclock itself at random times or when in absolute need.  Yes! One of the first ways I noticed my adderall was working. I had a long conversation with my boss and didn't drop off mid-sentence at all or math two words together because my brain and mouth couldn't agree on which to use. It was beautiful!  It happens to me all the time! Its especially frustrating when I forgot individual words and start to define the word I want to use and its just never a relevant point in the actual conversation. It makes me feel like im losing my mind because my word recall is slow. Its embarrassing but I try to power through it. Yeah. Happens to me with both talking and listening. My thought process will either completely derail or I'll ramble off into the woods somewhere and realize my tangent can't get back to the point. 

Also, when people are talking to me I'll frequently jump to jokes, items in the room, something in their teeth, any weird odors, or the song lyric that's repeating in my head. I'm getting really sick of The Spin Doctors.  Yup. Happens to me all the time. I will literally stop talking mid sentence and people are like ??????? Then when I realize I did that I have no idea what I was about to say.  No, that's like, specifically what ADHD *is*

To ELI5, ADHD is what happens when you have too many dopamine access transporters. Basically it's not that our levels are low, our levels are fine, but they're not going all the way they need too because the transporters are taking them while we are trying to use them. I like to tell people it's like you're cutting into a steak when a server comes by and says "oh you're done with this?" and takes the plate away

The problem is, dopamine is a neurotransmitter, you need it to *think*. So whatever your brain is chewing on when your dopamine gets snatched can get lost in the process. Forgetting what you were doing, hearing things incorrectly, forgetting what people's faces look like right after meeting them. 

This is ADHD. It's not "can't sit still can't pay attention disorder" that's just the most common symptoms. It is in much the same way PCOS is called polycystic ovarian syndrome when really the issue is high levels of estrogen being converted to testosterone and one of the red flag symptoms is the patient having hella cysts on their ovaries.
 Happens to me a lot but I've found writing regularly to be helpful for that.  Keeping a journal helps me focus when communicating my emotions to people, doing regular r/writingprompts helps me keep structured when telling stories, and I write at least one email a day explaining something interesting I've learned to someone... even if I just end up sending it to myself... and that helps me with giving instruction or explanations to say folks at work or my tutoring students.

Learning to gather and structure your thoughts on paper seems to help better gather, structure, and continue your thoughts in conversation. Ermagerd!  I do this all the time.  

I'll be in a conversation, bring in few examples of the topic of discussion, then back up to the original subject and pause, trying desperately to remember what we were talking about.

My spouse was worried it was Alz (runs in the family), but it was late diagnosed add.

Chemistry helps, but when I'm tired, it's not enough. yep

&#x200B;

First, I have a story to tell, but then, there's another related story that I've got to tell quickly. Then, there's another 2 related things. All the different tangents fly by, and I have no idea what I started with.  I thought it was just me getting older because I really struggle with word recall but I am not that old. I've gotten to the point where I am avoiding talking to people. I stick to a self imposed script for my job so I don't really meander off or lose my thoughts. I get very frustrated while trying to communicate so I try to do it as little as possible. Now that I am reading more about this stuff it's all clicking into place as far as understanding that I am not an idiot. The way I explain my thought process is like

'Some people usually 'think' in a strict progression of one logical connection to another. But actually, for me, my thinking is like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey....stuff.' Even when I’m talking my mind is thinking about something else. Then I have to stop and collect my thoughts to finish what I was saying.  Happens frequently, especially if there's some kind of noise or interruption...I was giving a presentation in my class the other day and an ambulance went by the building (which I could hear), and I ended up repeating the same sentence I was saying 3 times bc the noise threw me off. But also will occur just if I'm telling a long story and lose my place in it Happens all the time to me- The train of thought leaves the station & I'm just standing there waving goodbye!! Oh my yes.  And the results can be hilarious.

While leading a meeting for a project where I was lead engineer, my memory reset so hard mid-sentence I couldn’t even remember the purpose of the meeting, never mind what I was trying to say.  But words kept coming out of my mouth until I found an exit ramp and stopped.  

The others picked up the discussion without appearing to miss a beat.  Either I’d inadvertently made sense, or nobody wanted to admit they couldn’t follow The Leader.

 Shit like this happens when telling stories and idk if its ADHD but i am really bad at telling stories bc i focus on some details too much and others not enough and i look like a dumb idiot failure Spontaneous thoughts, poor working memory, fear of forgetting and poor impulse control can be a hell of a combination.  So i encounter problem a lot, i start a topic then switch to new topic several times. To deal with it i always try to wrap up each topic that i start by the end of the conversation. Most of the time i ask the people i'm talking to how we go to this point in the conversation and then i work backwards from there connecting all the different points. I've found that people enjoy talking to me a lot more now. Happens to me way too often.  Yep I'm so bad at telling stories!!! Omg it's the worst!!! Also talking with my mom on the phone, i'm pretty sure she has ADHD too but shes too lazy to get tested and doesnt really care. Anyways our phone calls can last an hour, and go from "Mom, this girl got wasted and got kicked out", then she asks "How are your grades?" to "Wait, so, she got super fucking drunk???!!!!, OMG NO WAY" That was one of the things my counselor pointed out when he suggested that I might have ADHD, having done that exact thing in our first session. 
 Just like in the movie Limitless where main character talks to random guys in bar about his book and it goes like "it is the society where... Eeeeyyyyyyee" :D I tend to go down several rabbit holes when speaking  Sorry to hear that, and thanks for sharing.  

Wellbutrin has generics (bupropion) that are pretty cheap, but it can be hit or miss with the different generic brands - they work differently so you might have to ask for a different generic at the pharmacy if one doesn’t work.  I’ve also heard wellbutrin is used for ADHD symptoms on its own, but I only used it combined with Prozac because of increased anxiety issues, so can’t really speak it how it is on its own.

Best of luck with your insurance :-/ I mentioned this to my mom, who told me the difference is basically forgetting where you put your glasses, vs. forgetting what they're for if you have Alzheimer's.

I do think people with ADHD tend to get going so fast our thought train derails. Or gets so far away from the station we don't get to circle back around in time.

It was nice to hear my therapists say they noticed I was doing it less with medication. Not sure what my point was. Shit. This happens to me way too often. I even try to think about everything I'll have to say beforehand, but as soon as I start speaking, I forget it all. Sometimes I give up speaking, because I already know I'll forget it halfway through... This happens to me all the time. That's why I hate it when people interrupt me when I'm talking, especially if I'm explaining something. Not only is it rude to interrupt someone but it's because I lose my train of thought. I also forget terminologies or words. 

Me: Crap, what word was it again? It's a freaking simple word. How can I forget it? Dammit it's on the tip of my tongue.

5 People staring at me: *waiting for me to finish what I was saying*

Then after I lose my train of thought, I ask someone where we were and they couldn't say because they weren't listing. Hahaha. 

Sigh... This happens to me often when I'm sleep deprived  It is with me, I lose my train of thought all the time. The worst of it is when I’m at work, I am an instructor for the U.S. Army for aviation maintenance, yeah not a good time to be getting lost... It can be. Not for me. But it can be. happens to me especially telling stories or something with a lot of information  Every single day.  Oh absolutely. Sometimes I just start making sound effects in place of the concepts I can't remember or flailing my hands like they totally explain what I'm trying to say as my thoughts degrade into nothingness or something else entirely.

I knew my meds were working when I only took a few minutes to type out comments/replies/emails/etc instead of 10+. This is actually how I could instantly tell Adderall worked for our ADHD kid. He was literally unable to finish a complete sentence, and then suddenly he could. Yes.

But don't completely blank out. But a key word will disappear from my mind leaving me fumbling about.  Me all the time!!! It contributes to my social anxiety because I feel like I come off rude or unintelligent to people who don’t know me well.  Most of the time when I talk, I overthink what I'm saying and listen to myself speaking. I then stumble on every single words. It's like when you're listening to yourself on a speaker and there's a slight delay. 😔😥  Some people love it some people hate it. It get worse when I'm stressed out  Yep, happens to me a lot and the more I try to remember what I was going to say, the more I don't know what is going on  Every. Single. Day. All the f*cking time my dude Smoke weed regularly? i have it sometimes but i dont know if its common I have a terrible problem with aphasia and stalled cognition. Ugh it happens to me all the time. My profs always have to piece together what I’m saying. I basically have to write down everything beforehand so that my questions make sense. As other comments were saying, yes it’s common. Memory is hard a thing for us ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Probably a working memory issue. Possibly identifiable as having a learning disability because of it. 

Speaking from experience. 

Is math really hard to do without a paper?  Yeah man, this happens to me too much. It's so frustrating. On the daily 😤😭🤯 After working together for a couple years my friend turned to me & said "we'll never run out of shut to talk about bc I don't think that you've ever actually finished a single story you've started without trailing off onto a different story  Its happens with people with adhd, but not all adhd people experience this. People without adhd also experience this. But not all people without adhd experience this.   Very often, it's easier to keep my train of thought if I've taken my medication.  It's not so much that I lose my train of thought, it's that someone switched the track to go off on a tangent.  This happens to my daughter too. But to send some positivity your way - I don’t have ADHD and it happens to me. So you’re not alone. 😊 Unfortunately. I do this on a daily basis. I’m not diagnosed yet tho (got a referral to a psychiatrist yesterday from my GP) so I don’t know if it is ADHD or not.... but I could say something to my wife like


OH MY GOD DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA?!?!?

...what?

I dunno.... I can’t remember.  Constant struggle. However, since I grew up around family members with severe ADHD it has made me very good at following other people’s train of thought and being able to predict what they are going to say. I’ve been asked more than once why I am a mind reader and I always reply by saying I grew up with an ADHD mother who never finished her sentences. My friends call this "cheetah zig-zagging" I do this a lot. That's like a poster child sign of ADHD I absolutely LOVE the fact that there's hardly a single spelling mistake in this entire thread. You guys are hilariously cool. It's happened to me.  Every. Damn. Day. Happens to me. Sometimes I just laugh it off and share that Michael Scott quote..

“Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.” This is one of my worst symptoms. Without medication, I can't finish a sentence. I bombed this part of the neuropsych eval. 

I have to write down EVERYTHING I will say, or I forget partway through. I genuinely never understood how people were able to explain how they understood things without writing, or how they gave presentations,  etc.

I still don't entirely understand it, but the words are more often able to make it out of my mouth when I'm medicated. I'm still much better at writing, however, and I *suck* at interviews, which is fun (I'm in the job searching process rn).  This happens to me but I thought it was my dyslexia/dyspraxia. Turns out I might have been wrong Yes, I have the same problem, as well as wasting time trying to retrieve lost trains of thought. Combine this with my Aspergers (trouble listening to two people at once, difficulty hearing certain accents/kinds of voices especially with background noise), and you have an extremely socially awkward person. Yes, it's considered a frequent/basic symptom Constantly. I've also read that people with ADHD are more likely to get alzheimers/dementia so...kinda both I guess.  Happens to me almost everyday. It's worse if I'm tired, forgot my meds or meds wore off (end of the day).  How can we manage this? This had happened to me a couple of times to myself. Yet, when people lose their train of thought or get distracted in a conversation, I somehow am able to remember where they last left they off.  Experiencing something in one language and trying to tell it in different one.  Umm yes.  ALL. THE. DAMN. TI ... wait, what?  I’m so glad there’s other people that go through this. People often think I’m ignoring them, I’m not, I just focus in other things while I’m talking or listening, it’s quite the peculiar experience. For example, someone might be telling me their life story, and I’ll somehow think about what I’m having for lunch. It’s angered many people, and I’m always at a loss for words when I try to explain my thought process. Yes, this happens to me even when I am on medication. I suddenly lose track of what I was saying and have to ask the other person what we were talking about. All the damn time. It’s the same reason I’ll walk into a room and forget what I was there for. Whatever I was thinking about on the way to my destination clears out my working memory and replaces what I was going into the room for. Or when I pull out my phone to make a note about something I want to do or to do something (because the best time to do something is now,right?) and get distracted by any notifications or whatever app I left open on my phone. I have the same problem. I also suffer from PTSD and have had multiple concussions, so I've typically chalked it up to that. It doesn't surprise me that it's an ADHD thing though. 

Will I ever break this cognitive decline, or is it only going to get worse? This happens to me all the time, I’m pretty sure it’s because of my ADHD  YUP. I do this all the time. It's made me a better listener bc I assume when other people are talking they're going to do it so I grasp onto the last thing they said and repeat it for them so they can pick up. Also helps when I've interrupted them.. If only I could stop interrupting and get through a thought of my own. Happens to me all the time. I like working in a fast environment where my head needs to do 100x at a time. I will admit that I know I may make errors or be more prone to make errors when doing administrative work. Going back to school and studying the sciences hurts my brain as much as I like what I am studying. The impulse to go elsewhere is infuriating. Sameeeeeeeee Yes. I’m hypersensitive to this problem in myself as I’m an adult in a leadership position in business...

The solutions I’ve come up with at work center around being super conscious of tangents and not losing track of the original seed thought. I write things down constantly and pause to reset my brain, when a tangent starts. Just being aware of the issue, helps a lot. All the darn time... not that I can ever get to the point of my stories, anyway.   Yes. I do it all the time. 

When I had chemo we called it Chemo brain.  I’ve never been diagnosed with ADHD and this happens to me quite often, I’ve recently started a new job and I was in talking with my new boss one day about a customer and completely forgot what her question was and what I was trying to say.. it was mortifying!  I’m a salesperson and frequently give long presentations.  I used to script it out, but I’d always lose track and lose my train of thought.

I tried outlines, but even then I often saw a bullet point and would draw a blank.

I’m smooth as silk when I’m unscripted and off the cuff.  For some reason, the change in flow and some sequence between each presentation, keeps it fresh in my mind and the key points all get covered. I usually just lose interest mid sentence and stop talking this happens to me all the time. i see it in my younger brother as well. he's awful at telling stories because of it, and even tho i have trouble too, he still has me tell the stories cause i'm a lot better than him haha I literally posted last night, and then forgot to include what I originally wanted to post about. 
I got lost in my own post, and could not remember what the heck I wanted to say. 

Yes, that happens to me.  I have ADHD and do this alllllllllllll the time. Most often when I’m telling a story. But keep in mind just because you have this one symptom does not mean you have ADHD... look more further into the disorder and talk to your doctor if you feel you meet the criteria. I've tried to stick close to main point of what I mean to say and not add more to the shit fire that's coming from my mouth Completely normal for ADHD. I do it all the time. My wife is constantly snaping at me telling me to finish what I was saying and I will say I don't remember. Most conversations are me trying to remember what people are saying to me, try to make a vague response specific enough to make it seem like I was listening and when I actually did listen or just have something to say I usually forget it completely midsentence and try to make it a coherent story anyway. I think it happens to everyone sometimes, but to people with ADHD it happens often.  Not with me.  Happens to me with basically anything. 

I can’t tell a story to save my life and even failed my oral master’s defense. 

I’ll be telling my husband a story and something as little as the smell of the heat kicking on will knock me off track and he’ll have to remind me I was in the middle of a story.  Definitely happens to me when off meds. Not all the time but sometimes. “Blah Blah blah blah....wait, i forgot what my point was in telling you this story.”

“...”

“..”

“Fuck, i can’t remember.” 

(Shame)

Or...

“Blah Blah Blah Blah...(friend interrupts with a related joke. I laugh) ...wait, what was i saying?” 

Takes so little the derail me.  Yup. Its definitely common for me, esp because I often go on tangents but I don't mind most of the time This happens to my bf all the time. He will be talking and then just stop. He says he just gets tired from holding onto the thought and lets it go  What is really strange is to be a very articulate person with a fairly large vocabulary and this happens to me. People look at me so strangely because on certain "channels" tons of eloquence comes out and then sometimes I can't remember the simplest word. It's like surfing a wave and then it just comes to an end. It happens to me multiple times a day PMSL yep, happens so often I can't tell you how many times. Happens mainly out of active meds hours though, or when meds aren't working at correctly. Yes, this is why i hate when people cut me off lol Constant battle. Speak to fast, people can’t follow, seem a little bit insane. Speak at a normal pace, forget what I was saying, seem a little bit dumb. 

I’ve found a balance between insane and dumb that is socially acceptable  Yes. All the time. My SO is so good and quickly reminds me of the last few things I said to prompt my memory. He’s the best. He doesn’t make it a big deal and helps me.  This definitely happens to me every damned day. I'm not even sure what I'm answering to here anymore but it's probably true Absolutely!  I think working memory is possibly the domain most affected by ADHD. Ya that totally happens to me. I'll be talking and it's like I have no idea what words I'm stringing together and I hope it all makes sense on the output. It's almost like I zone out on myself. I usually just say, ".. Or something like that" or "I don't know what I'm saying. Don't listen to me." Nice people will let it go, but if someone is a real Type A person they might make fun of me for it. I feel you, it's totally annoying and frustrating!  This is why everytime I want someone to know a story, I tell my friend that lived that story with me to tell the story instead of me Oh hey you just explained part of my life  If you are a person who is easily distracted, it is very common. I noticed that there is always some minor distraction that happened. 

Telling a story, or try to get a complex argument across... distraction and I am derailed like a train derailed by a penny I tell the best/worst stories, they are kind of like Pulp Fiction because I can't keep the whole string straight in my head at the same time. I end up just telling parts of it and then trying to pull them all together by the end. Like from the middle-out. Some people tell me they love it and others don't.  Worst for me is when I tell a story to make a point or lead into something and I get way too detailed in the story and then forget what I was doing in the first place

I can give you a billion details during that story but dont ask me to remember what you said just now YES. Middle of story: cue the amnesia.  > This happens to me, especially when I’m telling stories

This is actually how I ended up getting refereed to get evaluated. I went to a day-boarding school and lived in a house with other students. Nobody could understand where I was going with my stories. I don't remember if it was a teacher or a house parent that noticed it but it eventual got me on meds until college. a reason why i never tell stories to people, it always end abruptly haha.

Although playing DnD kinda improve it a little bit. I do it all the time, and then invariably someone will say "don't worry, if it was worth saying you'll remember!". Not really, it was worth saying I just can't construct a sentence without forgetting what I just said.  >With adhd if your attention is significantly shifted there is a chance your working memory will fault and basically reset. Leaving you wondering what the fuck you were just doing.

Wow, excellent, succinct explanation for why I constantly drop things. I've found if I pick something up and don't make an effort to focus on the process of getting it to the next location I inevitably drop it. 

It's a real problem at work. It takes so much effort to have an impromptu conversation in the hallway because i have to focus so specifically on not dropping what's in my hands while also focusing on the conversation, plus keeping my ADHD speed-voice under control so I sound normal, forcing myself not to interrupt when an idea hits my head and i feel like HAVE to say it, and stopping talking when external cues say to rather than keep going and going and going because something caught my hyperfocus interest. Etc. Etc, etc.

Being around other people while trying to work is exhausting. Except for me it feels like loading a video. Like I can keep talking for a few minutes after I loose my train of thought, before I forget what I was saying. Fuck. This is exactly what fucks me up at work.
 https://imgur.com/a/Y4cc0Rh also this. Lol  I just straight ask people what we were just talking about. 80% of the time being reminded is enough to get me back on the rails. Yup this. Or my personal favorite is to say "Sorry, my Train of Thought just derailed, went over a cliff, exploded, and there were no survivors."  or I change the last bit to say "and we're still searching for survivors" if I feel it was important enough to get back what I was thinking.  This is the most perfect example. Get out of my head
 It's like you just woke up from the Matrix.  Omg perfect description.

I'm not sure if it'd from the loss of memory, but when I lose it, I seem to have a silent panic attack.

I start thinking of easy things (my name, my age...) to try to kickstart my brain again. I definitely feel like a BSOD when I stop in the middle of a sentence forgetting everything while everyone is staring at me not sure what happened.  Also apparently I have Windows 10 installed because the computer does things on its own and doesn't allow me to change the settings. That's a damn good analogy.  (The RAM is one many think of.... But the memory leak and CPU random and when needed auto-overclocking is right on) >CPU which will overclock itself at random times or **when in absolute need**. 

Lol, I wish.

edit, actually I do see your point, the stable overclock shows up when needed, but mine has some like "Intel-turbo-boost technology"  bullshit that is just pretending to work hard. but is actually just useless bloatware. Plus we have a lot of bloatware in our operating system. Ah I understand, we're just all malfunctioning computers. Now that I'm medicated, I don't miss it at all.

At the same time, I still ramble like a champion. I think I never developed those skills to stay on track, so I still struggle to tell what the other person does or doesn't need to know.

If I strive for minimalism, other people think my thoughts are disjointed, but if I include more information, it's "oh no, Neo's going at it again..." Same - I have a long coping mechanism that I learned where, if I lost the train of thought of a convo I would pause with my mouth open and my eyes 'searching' (there was nothing to find, though) - this was mostly to give a visual cue to others that I was still working on the sentence.

I now know it due to ADHD, and when the meds are in full effect I don't do it. i can talk without those pauses. And when they start to come back, i know the meds have worn off. Definitely. 

The difference between me medicated and me not medicated, it that for the former, when I start swerving into a side quest, I can go “hold on. I’ll come back to that part after” and continue with the main storyline.  Oh my god, thank you for posting this. I struggle so much with this as well, it makes me feel so ridiculous and dumb but I’m so stubborn because I insist on using the word I forgot. Lmao, I burst out laughing at trying to explain the word that I can't think of. I would go on a tangent just trying to think about the word.  I relate so bad. Anytime I'm in a conversation I'm constantly looking around, even though I'm listening, and I'll just toss in things I notice like oddly dressed people (ex santa claus, crayfish). I often have to assure people I'm listening, consciously prevent myself from mentioning things and sometimes I even get so lost in my train of thought that I can't even begin a sentence when the other person is done. OMG this is me, all the time! *And if you want to call baby....*

Sorry, couldn't resist! I feel you, though. Omg. Are the songs an ADHD thing?? It can be so annoying. I'm trying to make a grocery list or think of what I'm supposed to do today and a song that's been playing in the background of my thoughts for what seems like days will start up. Then I'll start singing it and have to be like "OMG! Shut up! I have shit to do!". Seems worse with anxiety.  Mine also has some tingly-mingly stuff in it. Things and stuff and whatnot my thoughts have thoughts and those thoughts have thoughts. its like fractal art Lol. I tend to just follow my thoughts, and switch it up mid-story.  Keeps people on their toes. Sometimes I can completely change the topic with every sentence. If Itried forcing myself to stay on topic, I'd likely end up becoming mute.  Yea I’ve been doing this thing where I excuse myself for losing track and ask if I tied up the original point, rather than let myself go off the rails. It helps "oh, but then there was this, and because of the last time I....wait, there's also this, but that is more like this other thing that was like the whole point of that one thing in the first place.. are you even listening to me???  *snoring* .. so anyways, that same night, we were going to go......................" ffs lol Maaaaaaybe. That sounds way better.  I was never able to do mental mathematics. I cannot even do simple additions in my head for numbers beyond a certain point. I've always had really good memory, other than the little lapses I've described. I never learned much beyond basic math, and I always found it easier to do in my head than on paper, because whenever I have a pencil and paper in front of me I just start doodling shit instead of focusing on what I'm supposed to be writing down. Hahaha this is the best thing I've heard in awhile. Can totally relate. Yea, I'm like super-duper ADHD.

 Sometimes, I love it, and wouldn't change it for anything, and other times it causes severe depression and loneliness. 

Keeps shit interesting, at least.  Sounds like fun. I'm looking forward to it lol :) when I have to give a presentation, I do an outline, rehearse and practice.  When it comes time to the actual presentation, I have a sheet of paper with some notes/outline and just wing it. Yuup.

"...It's your turn to talk, now." lmfao I did the exact same thing. I emailed this guy I was transcribing all this stuff for, and explained how I did it, and how I could fix it, and why there's probably easily fixable mistakes, and basically every other aspect of the process I took to do it, then 3-4 hours later realized I forgot to attach the files lol. I think has to do with our spacial thinking capabilities. I do the same thing with stories, in also rabbit trail and include way more unnescecary details than most would. It affects my work too, but fortunately I've learned to use it to my advantage. I'm an electrician, and I am not as good at planning out large projects as many of my coworkers. 

However, I'm great at multitasking, and excellent at troubleshooting. I can figure out weird problems way faster than others because I can run several possibilities in parallel in my mind, and combine aspects of them to come up with solutions. I cannot figure out the most efficient way to pull wire unless someone else points it out to me. When I tell a story, I usually tell 3 extra stories within the story that weren't necessary to understand the original story, they were just somehow connected in my brain. This is also really common in ADHDers My son does something similar when he tells a story. He’ll start with mid-plot get to the end and we’ll have to practically diagram step by step, in chronological fashion, what event led to the next until we find the missing information he’s omitted. 

I tease him that he assumes we’re able to watch the same movie playing on the screen in his head while really he just fast forwards to the action and narrates only the bits he likes the most and then he gets annoyed at us for not paying attention when we have no idea what’s going on and can’t appreciate the humorous or tragic conclusion. 


 God bless the people who stay with me when this happens. Generally, I can watch people mentally check out as I continue on.  I'm a leader of a young adults ministry which means I give a fair amount of sermons.   


trying to find the balance in my notes between writing everything down and reading off the paper and putting just references but going through exactly what you just mentioned is an everyday struggle.   
 Didn't know this was common. People just get terribly confused every time I tell a story or try to explain something. I always skip parts unintentionally and it just ends up being all over the place "Wait, what was I just saying?" Years ago, well before I was diagnosed, I started saying that to myself (not heard it from anyone else before). The conversation would continue after I lose track and eventually say "nevermind I've forgotten where I was going with that", and if the trigger thought comes up again, it'll all come flooding back, where I would interrupt and say it before I forgot it again. Sometimes I'll ask the other person to say what they last said, and that would help.

I've got no idea where I was going with this.

Oh yeah! So I found it much worse if I sat there trying really hard to remember the thing...saying things like "gimme a sec", or "hold on it was important let me think". That just builds up anticipation for a huge anti-climax...super awkward. Better to just let go imo and if it comes back great. I hear that all the time! It bothers me so much. Maybe I’ll eventually remember, but when it’s not convenient. So how is that helpful? 🙄 If you have a habit of accidentally dropping things, I'd mention that to your doctor. It could be a neurological thing. If I'm interrupted AT ALL at work I basically need to start over. Counting? Start over. In the middle of an email? Takes five mins to get my train of thought back.  Holy shit, that's perfect. Thank you! That usually confuses me even more lol, because whatever I was talking about was typically something that didn't make a whole lot of sense to begin with :) I'll usually just be like "-- so anyways, I have no idea what I was just talking about so, lets move on... "

If I ask whoever I'm talking to, to refresh my memory, their response usually hurts my brain. I'm like "k whaaaat, I know literally nothing of what you speak.. =/ " *twilight zone theme song intensifies* Software update resettet my settings again Aha! I see what you did there! I sometimes go full hyperfocus on the last day of deadlines or at the morning of delivery day. So I think there is some truth in that "absolute need" phrase. Yeh that's what I kind lf meant, thanks more pointing that out. Mind me asking what medication worked for you? Ha I know the face exactly. I make it too.  Hm. If only I had the ability to set up and follow through with a doctors appt. I've gone 31 years unmedicated, other than a year of strong ritalin when I was about 12 that basically turned me into a zombie. The worst habit for me is that when I'm speaking with someone, they'll say something that brings up a topic I feel needs to be addressed, but I have to make a strong conscious effort to remind myself that I need to let them finish speaking before I blurt out what I thought they were going to say. 

I get impatient listening to people as well, because I frequently feel like I'm 2 steps ahead of them (I'm usually not). so I'll cut them off and finish what I thought there thought was going to be.  I have to constantly say before meetings at work "Every other person knows something you don't. You'll miss it if you don't listen"  Haha, I thought I was the only one! Is making up stupid words constantly another thing we do? lol I just blurt out dumb collections of syllables that usually don't even fit together. My dog is the only one that gets it :o) 🤣 I have adhd and also smoke weed in the reg, but forgetting wtf I was *just* thinking only came on with smoking all the time.  I cannot remember numbers. At all. Like, I can take the dimensions of a table, say, then go into a different room where I’m thinking about moving it and I’ll have no clue what the numbers were and I’ll have to go back and measure again. In the space of two minutes.  Yeah then your working memory is fine. I have good memory but when I was in school - I'm identified a what some would call "gifted" intelligence, even though math is really hard to do on an operational level due to the weak working memory. So in school in the classes I excelled in law, history, English, I would often have to endure the embarrassment of making a multi-step point on a complex issue only to lose my train of though point 2 of 4 and just completely stop talking in the middle of my point. 

I already had to endure the embarrassment of being "weirdly smart" and then the teacher would kind of look to me when the class is silent to their questions and I'd start going about something and then it's like literally the feeling of having your ram overflow and crash the system. 

I've gotten a lot better or maybe dumber as I got older - now 26 - also learning to use a scratch pad and make an outline of my points before making a complex verbal argument (again- my key strength is exceptional (for high school)  verbal communication skills and abstract reasoning weakened by a working memory issue that is contextually tied to my adhd.)  I guess my point is if you ever feel like your RAM overflows and crashes the entire system back to square 1 you might want to investigate "working memory" - it's a very specific type of memory - and ways to strengthen or accommodate it. 

Working memory > short term memory > long term memory  Yup. 
This week has been one of the most stressful weeks of my life - I had two MAJOR projects due, and tomorrow have to deal with the Thanksgiving lunch at my child care center. I am a toddler teacher, and dread this lunch. Parents come in and then leave and then come back in just to ultimately leave...then I am the one who gets to have a classroom full of ten screaming toddlers at what is supposed to be nap time. 

The stress of the projects plus the dread of the lunch has pretty much tried to kill me. I have cried and screamed and inappropriately laughed so many times...and my ADD is on 10. Even a 9 would be peaceful right now. I feel broken and like a crazy person. 

I can totally see where the files were forgotten. It’s legit.  I relate so strongly to this. I can conceive of great ideas, execution escapes me. 

However, putting out fires is my favorite thing to do.  I'm a receptionist so I have to multitask daily. Everyone says it must be hard with how many distractions I deal with every day but I think it actually helps that I only have time to work on a project in 5 minute chunks. I just keep a master list to make sure everything gets done. Ditto. I’m great to have around in a crisis or emergency, and my non-linear brain comes up with some pretty out-of-the-box plans/solutions to really difficult problems. 

That’s been one of the perks of a diagnosis: now that I understand this about how my mind functions, I’m way better at leveraging it for things like this.  I relate to this so much. Especially in therapy, I start talking avout something and suddenly I talk about another thing and even I don't realize at the end how they are connected. I tell those extra stories out loud at the same time, in no particular order.

 If I'm telling a story, basically every thought that I have comes out of my mouth. Lol so many stories we tell ourselves.... Yea, I'm very ADHD and I'm a fucking ninja when it comes to *not* dropping shit. That could have something to do with working in fields where I handle really expensive equipment, though. I know I was clumsy as hell as a child. LMFAO, yes it IS a neurological thing being that ADHD is a NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER!!!

How do I know when meds have worn off? I get clumsy again! I thought I was pretty clear so i don't know why you concluded I "have a habit of accidently dropping things," but I'll clarify--I don't have a habit of accidently dropping anything that has my attention. Totally. This describes much of my childhood. From about age 10-14 I did correspondence, where my teachers would send me all the assignments for the next week or two, and I would usually bang them off in the first 2 days. Then in highschool, I only went in on Thursdays, at 10am, and my teacher/counsellor would give me my entire weeks worth of assignments from 7 different classes, and I would typically be finished everything before the lunch hour was over. I graduated a year ahead schedule. I've had *some* success with Concerta and Focalin, but they didn't really last long enough. Losing my evenings was causing me to call into depression.

Recently switched to Vyvanse/Wellbutrin (50 mg and 300mg), and I'm really liking this combo. Never felt euphoria from it, so I don't think it's that. I'm completing personal projects, so my depression has let up considerably.

Downside is my insurance just denied the first refill, so I might not be able to continue.  What’s your other coping skills? Are you a list maker? Put it on your list and keep re-adding it until you go! 

The technology has changed so much in the last 10-15 years and there’s so many new options besides Ritalin. I’d 100% be in a very different place in both my career and personal life if I hadn’t discovered the magic of Vyvanse (FYI, I’m a few weeks from 34 and only got a diagnosis a few years ago, so I can empathize with your struggle).  I sometimes "invent" new words. Turkish grammar is flexible enough to allow me to do that.

And for the meaningless ones... Well let's just say they are the speech equivalent of abstract art. They make sense, but not really.

Btw, your doggo understanding you sounds so lovely :) I relate. Having a notepad helps in those situations. Also I try to repeatedly say aloud the numbers I am supposed to remember. Then focus on that repeat when I want to retreive the information.

You can say that I lease my brain's speech section to the memory management. You might also enjoy retail management... or so I hear. Oh yeah lists are essential for me. Fortunately my boss is aware of my shortcomings and likes me enough that he works to make things easier for me. When he send me out on a job, he will include stupid minor details that should not need to be on a list, just because he knows I will get the job done more efficiently and nothing that is on the list will be missed. If it's not on the list, there is a good chance I'm gonna overlook it.  No such thing as multi-tasking, it's not something our brains are capable of doing...just saying... :D I digress, but 'out-of-the-box' sounds like one of those phrases that could mean the opposite... I know you mean a 'unique, creative, unlikely' solution, but the phrase also sounds as if it could mean a 'prepackaged, one-size-fits-all' solution. Very interesting. Haha, twice in the same conversation I got asked a question, would think of a point and a really good anecdote to display that point, say the anecdote... and forget the point I meant to use that anecdote to display lol I'm also like this, but I figured that was because I got so used to drop things that I developed awesome catching skills  I meant otherwise. My interpretation of what they are saying is that, if they were drinking a cup coffee, and having a titilating conversation, they would drop the cup. That I wouldn’t personally describe as clumsy. 

Edit: I’m not denying ADHD being the cause, just that I felt worried it could be a sign of something else, hence why I said mention it to the doctor, but I obviously over stepped, and this must be more common than I thought.  Right, but the focus you put on the act may be the difference. There’s clumsy - not coordinated, bumping into things, spilling drinks, etc., but to drop something outright seems more a bit more suspicious. I have a friend who thought she was just not paying attention, and was just clumsy, turns out she has a neurological disorder. You can tak offence, but dropping stuff isn’t a “normal” thing. I’m sorry to hear about your insurance coverage issues.  I don’t know if you live in the US and it’s probably different from state to state but I worked in pediatrics for seven years and Vyvance was often denied by insurance.  Where I live if your Dr office sends in proof of other medications that are covered being tried already and your Dr submits this is the medication he thinks you need then they would cover after those things are submitted.  We’d often have to go through the same process every 3 months or so for several patients.  I don’t know if this information is helpful but I figured I’d mention it just incase.  It’s super frustrating and really pissed off the Dr I worked for because it’s redundant.  Obviously the insurance knows you’ve already tried the other medications they’ve covered in the past and obviously Vyvance is what your Dr thinks you should be taking otherwise he wouldn’t have prescribed it but the insurance still required us to jump through their hoops to get these patients medications covered. I'm currently 16 years old and i've been taking 72 mg of Concerta for a while. I dunno if it's just me, or if it's this way with all ADHD medication, but lately i've been more conscious of being.. i dunno less happy with myself when i'm on medication. 

like i'm super productive, as opposed to the zero productivity when off meds. i can focus, get shit done. but i find when i'm on medication, i'm totally devoid and detached from emotions. music doesn't interest me (and i LOVE music), and i've noticed sometimes i could get into a fight with my girlfriend or something awful happen and i don't feel a thing. is this normal?  There are coupons online for Vyvanse! Through Shire, the manufacturer. I think you’ll pay a max of $30/month.  Lists are pretty useless for me. I'm great at making them; not so great at following them. 

As for coping, I essentially don't. I used small amounts of meth from age 20-25, which helped my focus a lot, but it obliterated my many other aspects of my mind, and body. Luckily I managed to quit that shit before I got carried away. Been in quite the shitty rut for the last 3 years, though. I moved back in with my mom because she had a stroke (the same day my 4 year relationship ended), and that plopped me into a pretty deep depression. I still haven't been able to dig myself out of the hole. 

From 17-25 I absolutely rocked at life and was making a shit ton of cash and had a ton of good friends, a stable relationship (lol yikes). Then when I cleaned up, I stopped caring about a ton of things, including myself. I got a dog, and she keeps me occupied, but it's definitely not a healthy lifestyle. I honestly don't know wtf my future holds. 

I *could* do anything, but I don't *want* to do anything. Just tired of the struggle, most days.

sorry, lol hope I answered your question? Yes, saying them aloud definitely helps. I wish we still had to memorize phone numbers—it was good practice :) Hahaha. The phrase should probably read “outside-the-box”, but I work in IT and “out-of-the-box” is common parlance (and actually, closer to what you described) and my brain went there instead because I was typing in a hurry 😂

Good catch! I felt this my whole life but most recently, yesterday. Typically I'll mindlessly play with my ring or something and drop it - hearing the tinkle as it hits the ground. Of course, everyone looks and I pick it up...and keep doing it oblivious to how annoying it probably is to them.

Anyway, yesterday I was handing over a bunch of keys to a locksmith and they were not tied to a keyring, just loose. One decided to make a break for freedom and quick as a flash I caught it. The guy said "Good catch", and I was so surprised, I had to agree. >a friend who thought she was just not paying attention, and was just clumsy, 

Oh, so NOT a person diagnosed with ADHD, but just a person who THOUGHT they weren't paying attention?  That's exactly what I described, right?  Oh wait, it is not at all what i described.

But, you are so right! It is just me  "taking offense" when I disagree after you inaccurately understand and incorrectly describe my ADHD symptoms as not adhd, only on the basis of your non-adhd experience (yes, I saw that you are a retired neurological nurse who thinks she has ADHD but hasn't bothered to be tested for it.)  Is it any surprise you see a neurological disorder instead of ADHD? 

Additionally, your insistence that it is something other than ADHD, on the basis of you having ONE friend who had neurological issues when she dropped stuff is pretty uneducated, so I will take your "nurse" credentials with a grain of salt.

And by all means, here on this ADHD reddit thread, tell me more about how my description of my ADHD symptoms is me being not "normal," and how me explaining that I have learned that my issues come from my ADHD is me "taking offense." 

My psychiatrist will get a good laugh out of your response but I predict he will be as irritated as I am to see that someone feels the need to make alternate diagnoses online, explaining that ADHD symptoms are not "normal,"  when a person on an ADHD forum is describing their ADHD symptoms.  

And last point, did you not learn in nursing school that ADHD *IS* a neurological issue? Thank you. 

Actually I was at my prescriber's office this morning to work out the issue. They sent the Prior Auth to my insurance, and at this point, I'm just waiting for a response.

Either that or they give me a script for another medication instead. I don't like having this all up in the air... Got a call that my prior auth was approved. Oh joyous day.

&#x200B; There's a lot in here that I can respond to, but I will try to avoid being too overwhelming.

>  i'm totally devoid and detached from emotions

This is me on or off medications. maybe not 100% detached, but I feel like my emotional reactions are underwater. I still get extremes, so the next statement make sense.

Switching to Vyvanse, I feel much more stable, fewer extreme lows. I also upped my Wellbutrin (antidepressant), so it's difficult to tell what is what.

For you, it actually sounds like it might be a problem, as it's hurting your quality of life. I hear this can happen when your dose is too high, but then you run into issues with it not being effective enough.... My last stint on Focalin, we reduced the dosage and I stopped taking it over the weekends, or when I wasn't working.  This helped with its efficacy, but I was frustrated by being ineffective during the evenings (constant problem since I started meds in general) I know that feeling so well. 

One thing that helps me a lot when I’m real deep in “do not want” is external motivation: aka, I promised someone else/agreed to meet them/whatever. 

Just trying to get you to think about in the most extremes when you don’t want to do something, what’s the thing or things that’ll even sorta work? There’s got to be something, cause you probably feed yourself/put clothes on/leave the house once and a while. Harness that, even if it takes 10 or 100 attempts to work, and get thee to a doctor. 

My life seriously did a 180 after I got diagnosed and medication. Things are still hard much of the time, but I’m more equipped to navigate them. I believe in you, Internet stranger. YOU CAN DO THIS! 😁😁😁 Ah, I could never memorize a phone number. They used to show these phone numbers for a kids game show on TV where you would call and play the game over the line. I was never able to memorize that number, or remember to note it down. Is you being an asshole also related to your ADHD? I didn't learn about that symptom in nursing school either I guess. I just made a post, while explaining my situation a little more, but it seems i feel pretty similar to how you’re describing. and a few months ago i did get my dosage upped from 54 mg to 72 mg, which could be a reason. however, for some reason i just don’t think it is the reason. although, again, it could be. i’m on a 90 day trial, so at the end of it, i’ll be seeing my psychiatrist again. 

two of my brothers take Vyvanse, and it does seem to work for them. i know we are both completely different people, and you know essentially nothing about me but, do you think I should consider Vyvanse? Nope, but if you have to ask I'm guessing your nursing school didn't teach you much about ADHD. 

My assumption that you are an asshole, on the other hand, comes directly from reading your posts.  Fuck off. That's be up to you and your doctor. I cannot give medical advice.

I'd say to be open to it. As you said, you're not your siblings, so it might work for you. Or it might not. I should drop this, because it feels pointless, and I definitely can admit that I do not know everything there is to know about ADHD. I'm sure you could teach me plenty. Being a nurse gives me a basic overview of certain medical conditions, though it's definitely not going to cover everything, and ADHD is one of those topics that has a short lesson, but ADHD being a neurological issue can't explain away every symptom a person might have. There's no doctor saying, "hmm is this MS, or is this your ADHD?" You having ADHD is a reason for you to have things be not "normal" in your life, it's just that dropping things can be a red flag otherwise. The example I gave of a friend was just to say that they brushed it off as something they weren't focusing on, just as you said it happens when you're not focusing. My neuro experience was years ago, but it definitely gets my spider senses tingling, that was the case here. I offered no diagnosis. I was not trying to offend you, and perhaps you felt attacked, so I apologize for that.  thank you, I understand. I appreciate your responses more than you know. this has been helpful. have a good day! >but ADHD being a neurological issue can't explain away every symptom a person might have.

 Omg. Lmfao. No shit, sherlock.

>There's no doctor saying, "hmm is this MS, or is this your ADHD?"

Are you serious? D you really think doctors don't consider comorbidity when they address symptoms?  What kind of doctors do you deal with that you think the above? Or is your opinion based again in your lack of knowledge about ADHD treatment? 

>You having ADHD is a reason for you to have things be not "normal" in your life, it's just that dropping things can be a red flag otherwise

Lmao.  You know absolutely nothing about this symptom or what it means. You have a hammer so everything is a nail.

>My neuro experience was years ago, but it definitely gets my spider senses tingling, that was the case here.

Then this is a great opportunity for you to get better educated about ADHD so you don't  automatically tingle when you think that a general description of an aspect of a person with ADHD  coincidently looks like something you used to deal with and you decide to keep telling someone what that general symptom  REALLY is.  

> I was not trying to offend you, and perhaps you felt attacked, so I apologize for that 

Oh, I didn't realize you thought that calling me an asshole was just a friendly overture.  /s

Perhaps you felt attacked back,  so I likewise apologize if YOU did not feel the right thing. /s

Actually, I agree that what you are doing is not only pointless but offensive, whether you realize that or not, so i am asking you again to please stop commenting on a stranger's symptoms on a reddit where people come to discuss ADHD. Apparently, I wasn't clear enough when I said "fuck off" before. Sticking my foot in my mouth isn’t a totally uncommon thing for me, so I can accept when I’m wrong, I just like to be put in my place in a respectful way. That way I can leave thinking how at least I learned something. Your sarcasm is obnoxious, and you’re incredibly rude, so today, instead of just walking away with my tail between my legs, I’m leaving thinking how you’re just not a nice person. 

I’ll clarify my above comment, I was apologizing for my initial comment, as I didn’t mean to offend. I’m not apologizing for calling you an asshole, because you are an asshole. 

Another successful reddit interaction. Officially fucking off now. So you need people to *respectfully* tell you how disrespectful your repeated  misdiagnosis of their symptoms was. And that you think the person you are  misdiagnosing is an asshole because they responded sarcastically when you called them an asshole. First.

Good to know you call that a successful interaction. Officially fucking off and thinking I'm not a nice person is fine with me. 

I much prefer that to having to politely tolerate someone who is explaining how adhd doctors don't understand adhd symptoms,  and who gets  offended when their offensiveness is pointed out. For some reason I can't stop myself. Again, I never offered any diagnosis, let alone repeated misdiagnoses (at this point I question if you understand what that word means), just that dropping stuff seems like something you'd want to discuss with your doctor. Apparently your doctor already knows that you drop things often, and that's all you had to say. Instead you were rude, and defensive, then nauseatingly obnoxious (not to mention creepy, as you went into my post history). At no point have I argued what your doctor knows or doesn't know, or proclaimed to know anything at all, actually. I had some concern based on you dropping things often enough it makes your work life difficult, I shared it, unsolicited (which is totally my bad, I was out of line), and now I'm feeling your wrath for having engaged with you, so I take back any of my concern for you and your well being.
 >For some reason I can't stop myself...

Clearly not.

>At no point have I argued what your doctor knows or doesn't know, or proclaimed to know anything at all, actually. 

Actually you did, with this really ridiculous statement:

>There's no doctor saying, "hmm is this MS, or is this your ADHD?"

Unreal.

>Apparently your doctor already knows that you drop things often, and that's all you had to say. 

No. It's not necessary for a person to share personal medical details in order for you to back off when a person asks you to back off.  

>so I take back any of my concern for you and your well being.

Well, obviously.  Didn't you say this?

>you were rude, and defensive, then nauseatingly obnoxious (not to mention creepy...

I could feel your concern for my well-being right through the screen!

So yes, that works for me-- because what I objected to were your statements that in no way came across as "concern," so if you are withdrawing them that is much appreciated.

For example, this: 

>I had some concern based on you dropping things often enough it makes your work life difficult,

That is in no way an accurate description of the situation I described, but it does encompass all of your mis-assumptions that led to your implication that no doctor would notice ms (your *mis-diagnosis* ) when their patient has adhd.
