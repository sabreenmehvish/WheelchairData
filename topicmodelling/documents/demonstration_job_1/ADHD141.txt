Color Experiment: What color is this dress? This is either a very elaborate internet prank, or people genuinely see different colors in this dress http://i.imgur.com/aKPmTXX.jpg  

ADHD is linked to differences in visual perception, so what do you see?

1. Black and Blue

2. White and Gold

3. Blue and Gold/Brown

 >ADHD is linked to differences in visual perception

Got a source on that? Is this a joke? To me it is clearly blue and black. I checked the original picture on my desktop and I saw the same colors as on my phone.

I don't believe the people saying other colors. Gold and whiteish brown for me to me it looks sort of silvery gray with gold-brown stripes, but my son (12) said it was black.  HOWEVER, he was sitting off to the side, and his angle of view might have affected the way the LCD monitor looked to him.  He's never seemed to have any weird color perception for things in the real world (as opposed to screen images).

I asked him to sit right in front of the screen and look again, and he said it looked grey and brown. 

edit:  someone posted this link in the original thread, for what it's worth:  [Color Balance Illusion](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/science-one-agrees-color-dress/)


I tried saving the image so I could play with the color balance a bit.  I do see more blue in it than I did at first. To me, it looks light blue and gold.  My wife sees white and gold. 4. Periwinkle and tan Sure, how many would you like?

And then there's the high comorbodity with dyslexia.

Is that enough?

The first link is particularly relevant as one of the findings relates to the colors in this dress: *"Children with ADHD exhibited more errors than their typically developing peers on a colour perception test (FMT), particularly with blueâ€“yellow stimuli."*

So enough of the chit-chat - what colour do you see /u/sugardeath? I sent the picture to my boyfriend and he said it was white and gold, the next time he came to message me he was like "what the hell why is it black and blue now?!"  Show your phone to someone else.  I can't understand how my wife sees white (for the light blue part that I see), and how you see black for what I see as brown/gold.

This is not a monitor calibration thing, because people see different things on the same screen. All of the images look like blue and black to me in the article. Just that on the left the image is more bright and dull, while on the right there is more contrast. They look all the same color to me under these changes. But even if I took the images separately they would still be black and blue dress just different shades of blue and black. Great, thanks!  I hadn't known there was evidence of a connection before.  Great sources! I did that and my dad saw blue and black as well. So, what colors are the dress? I see blue with black stripes. The colored bands kind of look brown/gold, but I think that's due to potato camera quality and the light source.
