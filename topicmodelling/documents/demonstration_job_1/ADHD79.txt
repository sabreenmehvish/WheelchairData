New school organization app! Downloaded a new organization app called Chipper today. Goal is to help map your time more effectively/keep track of everything you have going on. So far I like the layout, and it was just released in September so it’s pretty new and they’re looking for ways to improve it. Hope this is helpful to some of you! I'll check it out! I've been using Samsung Notes as just a "to do list" and it works well enough but I'm interested in seeing what could work better than just listing it lol
