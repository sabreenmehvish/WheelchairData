"Driven To Distraction" had me bawling my eyes out more than any other book **tl;dr:** Read or listen to books on ADHD.  You'd be surprised what sort of emotions come up, and you may even find yourself growing to accept a lot of the suffering you've been through.

I've been listening to ["Driven To Distraction" on Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/Driven-to-Distraction-Audiobook/B00FRQFA8O) for the past week or two, and each story brought up a whole wave of emotions as I looked back on my life to see all the different points where the type of problem highlighted in the story had a hugely negative impact on my life and the people around me.  Sometimes it was too much and I had to pause the book and calm down a bit.

I'm only halfway through Driven To Distraction, but it's given me a tremendous amount of relief while helping me accept a lot of past mistakes.  I'm also left feeling fearful of repeating a lot of those mistakes and worry that I'll never quite get with the program of life.

The part that got to me the most was when the author read a letter written by parents to their son who was struggling with ADHD during college.  I'd always had a tough time bringing ADHD up with my parents because I grew up with the dialogue that "ADHD is just another way to give drugs to kids" or "ADHD isn't real, you just need to sit down and hit it hard" or "depressed people just need to buckle down, stop being sad, and fix their life".  It was those sorts of ideas that led me to hold off on seeing anyone about ADHD until I was 26 years old while self\-medicating with alcohol and cannabis to calm myself down when things were getting tough.  I thought for sure I was okay starting that journey on my own, but hearing this letter and the overwhelming amount of support and understanding which came out through the words had me looking back on all the unnecessary suffering I went through because my parents didn't want to accept that something might be a bit different about their kid.

Getting through to my parents about these sorts of struggles is still a problem today as I near my 29th birthday.  Around the holidays last year, I brought up ADHD with my dad, the main voice behind the "just sit down and focus" attitude I grew up hearing.  This is the same man that denied the existence of ADD/ADHD while growing up.  When I told him I've seen multiple psychiatrists about this and passed their tests for ADHD with flying colors, he told me he's dealt with "that sort of thing" his whole life and just toughed his way through it with discipline, more coffee, and working longer hours.

I don't think he realizes how painful it is to have struggles I face every day trivialized down to a lack of discipline.  It's especially painful to now see this dismissive attitude as an unwillingness to try to understand struggles he's never experienced himself.  I get that he's just trying to inspire more effort on my part because, to him, I'm just lazy and don't try hard enough.  I also get that he doesn't want anything to be wrong with his son.  Knowing those things and trusting that, in the end, he's a great man, makes his attitude only a bit less painful.

Anyways, I mostly posted this to share the idea that reading/listening to books on ADHD has had a huge and mostly positive impact for me.  It felt relieving to hear stories so similar to the struggles I've faced along the way.  I never really thought I was alone in experiencing problems with ADHD.  I've lurked on this subreddit for years and have plenty of friends who face similar struggles, but it still helped to hear these problems laid out and discussed in depth.

And even though the letter wasn't from my parents to me, even though I heard words I'd hoped to hear from them for most of my life, listening to that part of the book overwhelmed me with a lot of unchecked and repressed emotions concerning my parents.  It was painful to listen to, but in the end I felt so much better.  Even if I don't ever hear that sort of acceptance from my parents, I feel like I can finally look all that pain and suffering in the eyes, accept it, and move on.  I didn't even realize how much it was bothering me until it all came out while listening to that letter. Is there any chance your Dad has adhd? That would explain why he sees these issues as normal... The thing is that growing up with adhd is so much harder in today’s society. With the advent of the internet and electronics, distractions are everywhere and every social media company employs full teams dedicated to figuring out how to make their product as psychologically addicting as possible to give you as many hits of dopamine each time you log on, and that temptation is sitting in everyone’s pocket. My favorite part of this book and his other book "Delivered from Distraction" is when he lists out traits and quirks that are common to adhd. It is not diagnostic criteria but rather a collection of his observations over years of being a psychiatrist and having adhd himself. It really is like he gets inside your head and I became overwhelmed and releived with a sense of understanding. It almost exactly mimicked the inner dialogue I have every day.

Highly recommend "Delivered" as well. I cried so many times while reading that book. I was curious and 80% sure I had ADHD so I wanted to educate myself. Every one of those stories had something so insanely relatable that I was moved to sobbing a few times. After all the information included I knew that was what had been holding me back my entire life. I finally went to a psychiatrist after reading it and sure as shit have ADHD. I waited until I was 25 and now I've been on medication for a few months and feel 10,000 times better than before. I was told many times by my parents to "get my head out of my ass" and do what I have to do. Since I've told them about it they've been understanding, but not exactly supportive. I empathize with you very much and I think everyone with ADHD, or anyone with a loved one that has ADHD should read that book.  I cried insanely hard when I read that book, too!  I remember sitting in the target parking lot on break from a job reading it and not being able to go back to work on time because my eyes were red and puffy. My parents are also of the just drink more coffee, pull yourself up and get to work variety. They will never understand.  But that’s OK. They don’t have to, only I do. I have the right to treat my ADHD without their input.  I have the right to learn as much about this disorder as I can and to implement as many things that will help me as I can. I have a sleep disorder that is a circadian rhythm disorder where I cannot fall asleep before 4 AM. I can’t wake up in the morning.  People REALLY don’t understand that.  Just go to bed earlier.  My pcp tells me to go to bed at 9.  Mmmmmmk, I’ve Been formally diagnosed with delayed phase sleep disorder, but you’re right, I should just go to bed earlier. It’s insane people think I haven’t tried that 1 million times.  My parents will never understand my sleep disorder, either.  I still have the right to treat it and to treat myself with respect. All you can do is take care of yourself. I know it’s hard with parents to want to do and believe in what they say, to make them happy, but sometimes that just can’t happen.  I wish you focus! and peace! on your journey to wellness.   It was a peculiar experience for me too to listen to Driven to Distraction. Until that point in my life I thought that I was just exaggerating some experiences and symptoms that I shared with the people on this sub - I didn't think I might actually have ADHD, only share some similar traits as they are afterall fairly normal in quality at least. However, when all but one (and afterwards, thinking of definitions, maybe even that one could match in part) symptom from the ADHD in adults list fit me so well it was getting creepy, I had to accept at least the possibility that I genuinely might have ADHD. That it wasn't impossible.

Never before could I relate to any group of characteristics or symptoms quite so well, it was in part a relieving experience in that sense, but also made me worry as I'd hoped that my focus could get better if my depression only lifted. But most of the symptoms were there even before my depression if I'm being honest, it only adds to them.

Uhh not sure where I was going with this, suppose I just wanted to say I had a similar experience with the book and it definitely changed the way I look at some of my past actions and such. My mom is just like your dad. She just denies her possible AD(H)D  (I have been diagnosed with ADD) and makes me feel like I am imagining my own problems and says that I should "Just work harder and study more in school" so I know how frustrating it is to have your parent underrate your difficulties with AD(H)D. My dad probably has ADHD but his attitude has always been practical. He has always told me what are you going to do about it when i complain about adhd related things because he understands that no one out there actually cares and that you have to push through things to get what you want. Especially because he's seen my self destructive behaviours hurting my goals OMG I think I'm just about to finish listening to this book! I'm getting a little stuck because everything really held my attention up until the chapter about treatment and, well... I'm having a hard time being motivated to do Anything, which means I don't think I could start scheduling my life, let alone listen to someone tell me how to schedule my life. 

But I really want to finish this book so I hope I can make myself keep going. It's been so good! I like the voice actor. Hey man - your dad might have ADHD, don't disregard that possibility, or a mild variant.

The thing is, I've realized over the last few years, is that people **hate** when other people get what they couldn't get.

Example: I've done an ADHD group class the last few weeks, met other people and stuff. There's this girl there, she's between 25 and 30 I think. She tells me that "I couldn't really concentrate and focus in school so I didn't have to attend, I studied at home and met all the goals so that was great".

I was diagnosed five *fucking* **months** ago. No one cared a bit that I might be different, no one saw anything but a smart kid that talked too much and didn't put in the effort, didn't **try hard enough**.

And that makes me... resent her? For having support? It feels unfair... 

It's like a gauntlet. Your dad ran through the gauntlet and made it out, and now you're not gonna run it? You're getting help? But when he was sad as a kid, crying, he got slapped in the face and told to suck it up and put it away and he **fucking did** and he survived and now people are going to **care about how you feel**?

No one cared about him, or me, or some other person, but now all of a sudden we are caring about people having needs, instead of just saying "cookie cuttter", fit in or die?

Reflect upon how much **I** have had to hide and suck up compared to you, how lucky you are to have a diagnosis at a young age and the fact that you're getting support I never could? And I made it. I built a family, got a high paying job, sorted shit out, but you need support?

Of course you do, and you should get it. And I need to let go of that past, that shitty, fucking past that didn't help me reach... some higher potential, because no one knew, saw or just said "you're lazy, you don't care, you're not trying".

**Because it is GREAT that we care now, that we don't just ignore the differences and needs of people**. 

But your father might feel that resentment. He sucked it up and fit into the cookie cutter mold, and worked longer hours (because he was inefficient and needed more hours) and drank more coffee. So he dares not think or feel that he might have needed actual help or that anyone else could need help. Because he pushed through.

I feel ya, man. My parents accept it and... I mean, imagine the amount of guilt you feel as a parent for pushing when you should've listened...

I do the same thing... to my kids. I've got ADHD but I use the same value system as my parents. Lazy. Try harder. Focus. Listen, will ya.

I'm trying, really, really trying, to break that mold. You inspired me, but remember, in the end, everybody actually tries their best. Even your old man. The way he knows how. 

Hugs. Thank you so much. Sitting in the airport, waiting for my flight. I downloaded this 20 minutes ago because of your recommendation (used Audible for the very first time) and listening to this book with some tears in my eyes already.  Your post made me buy it. Can't wait to read  OP, this is such a Mood™️ for me too, like so much of this could be taken from my head-  i brought out a fucking highlighter on this book. 

i read the first chapter and quite literally sat there on my just holding the book on my bed and sobbing. pretty much every chapter i either felt a huge sense of relief or one part made me start sobbing. i devoured that book and was a wreck the whole way through, but a good wreck. 

i mean, i had doubts about my ADHD diagnosis before, but after reading that book? i have had none. 

which is huge for me, i have doubts about having dyscalculia (LD) and uh. i’ll let you know when i’m able to do basic multiplication in under double the normal amount of time.  ADHD runs in families. maybe when your dad says, "he's dealt with that sort of thing his entire life" he really means it. maybe he knows all to well the struggles you are experiencing. It's quite possible that his unwillingness to except your ADHD is more about him not wanting to except the possibility that there may be something "wrong" with himself, combined with the bitterness that if he had to struggle, you should have to the same way. there was probably zero awareness of ADHD when he was growing up, and he was likely told that he was lazy too, so he is simply continuing the cycle. I'm not saying its right, or fair, but maybe seeing him with more empathy, will inspire him to do the same with you. sorry, late to the party. i should had read the commentary before impulsively answering.   My parents lied to me about my diagnosis until I was in my early twenties. My grades went from Cs to As when a friend started giving me her meds to do big projects. That’s also how I got through college, and only in my last year was a fully medicated. 

But my point is that all our symptoms, losing stuff, not preforming as someone with a superior IQ should meant I wasn’t trying (yeah they withheld the adhd diagnosis but hung that genius shit over my head all my life), my impulsivity, my difficulty doing (re. Focusing enough) assignments at all (I did the why try if I’m just going to fail anyway, thing, and stopped doing homework), my inattention, my lack of short term memory so forgetting to do what they’d just told me to do (executive functioning deficits ftw!)........ all that shit was character flaws and because “I wasn’t trying hard enough.”  It’s taken so long to beat those internalized messages. 

But at 25 I moved back in with my mom after my dad died. And she realized when unmedicated, I still did all the same stuff I did as a kid, and she finally accepted that this is me, adhd is real. She didn’t apologize, but she did say she realized I wasn’t doing it on purpose. That meant a lot. I’m sorry you didn’t get that (yet) with your family  I also grew up hearing similar things. My mom was the one who told me to just deal with it, and that I just need to try harder etc.. She was diagnosed herself when she was a kid, but ritalin didn't work for her so she decided I didn't need to be evaluated. 

&nbsp;

Yesterday at work, I overhead a mother and her partner.. husband? I don't know, they were acting like a new couple, but the guy said theyve been married 10 years. Anyway, she told him that her son doesn't apply himself in school, he doesn't get the best grades, but he is smart. I said to myself "Sounds like the kid has ADHD!" 5 seconds later she says, "I think he has adhd, but hes smart, and I think that if he tries he can do it." The guy she was with said that he just needs to concentrate and that if he isn't doing well in class, his teachers must be schmucks. lol. Long story short, It upset me to know that people still think about ADHD that way. I wish there were more informative documentaries for parents to watch that weren't about the abuse of medication.  I can relate. That is a great book that I relate to in too many ways. I tried to read that book! But... you know... ADHD... lol It's incredibly emotional to confront dead on things and feelings that you have just lived with without really thinking of your entire life.  Sorry couldn't read the whole thing but read the  title few days a go. and downloaded the audio book. Thank you so much for sharing this info. My dad has adhd but grew up in the era when “beat it out of him” parenting was acceptable. 
He has self-medicated with ridiculous amounts of caffeine and self loathing his whole life and routinely makes these same types of comments to his kids. 


Edit: most popular is “Get over it! That’s life! *I* never needed drugs and neither do you” I've thought about this a lot.  A lot a lot.  And I don't think so.  I think my mom has it, but not my dad.  He's always quite organized, never has motivation problems, leads sales teams, always has that go\-getter attitude, plans and deploys plans with no problems, stays on task with no problems, etc.  If he has ADHD, it's an ADHD I have never seen or learned about anywhere else.

His idea of having ADHD is just being able to switch tasks at work a lot between conference calls, sales calls, team meetings, drawing up marketing campaigns, etc. The problem is...he's never actually described any of the underlying issues of ADHD.  I think he doesn't see them as normal, but instead sees it the way a lot of us don't want to be seen.  Lazy, unmotivated, lack of discipline and focus and will power, etc.

I've never made it far enough in a conversation with him about ADHD to talk about the deeper problems going on.  He hears "I get distracted" and immediately says "just have coffee nearby, do some jumping jacks or pushups, and don't be distracted anymore". And on top of it, people have shortened attention spans which makes people think our problems are caused by computers. That list creeped me the hell out. One was something like, “likes bicycles, even if not a regular rider.” How did he know that! And why do I like bikes so much? I'll have to check that book out!  Thank you for the recommendation. Can anyone post that list?

I have driven to distraction laying around, but didnt immediatly find it My 3rd grade teacher tried hinting to my mom that I might have adhd and she was furious...fast forward to junior year in high school when she sat me down after doing some research to say she scheduled me an appointment to get me tested. She thought I would throw a fit because I usually wanted to do the opposite of anything she asked of me, but I was just like "oh, ok"...I haven't exactly been the best student or daughter but both my parents are super supportive and I just got back on meds after 10 years of being off of them (after turning 18 I had to find a different doctor and just never did, until now oops! Better late than never!) It's possible.  I won't claim I'm qualified to say one way or the other.  He doesn't come off as the resentful type, and I've never really seen any symptoms that would be in line with ADHD. I'm 95&#37; sure my Mom has ADHD.  She sets off most of the flags.  She'd never get herself checked out, but I can still see a lot of her patterns holding herself back today, and most of them scream ADHD. Yep, my dad self-medicated with a SHITTT TONNNN of coffee (and for a short time, booze). He was lucky to be very intelligent so he could a job as a math professor at a college that was quite lax in letting him do what he wanted. 

The worst, though, is that he was "lazy" (classic fucking word) and he was in particular lazy about his health. He didn't check up on certain health issues and then he had a heart attack and was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in the same year. Colon cancer, by the way, is a type of cancer that is easily detectable at early stages. But he didn't do it. And I guarantee that if he had been treated for ADHD his whole life, he would have.  Same here.  Cool, was just a suggestion as had to get my mum to fill out a questionnaire when I was diagnosed - also the "have a coffee" is textbook self medicating.  My mum went from, I don't think you have that to, do you think your dad has it.  Now trying to convince her it's definitely her side of the family it's on, including her.  It didn't occur to me though for a while that she did have it.

Now my wife gets defensive a bit when I say our 3 year old likely has it.  Know you can't generally diagnose early, but she's so textbook in certain ways. It was definitely in "Delivered", I had the audio book though. I agree, this does seem possible. My father also did this with his health. Incredibly creative solitary man who died suddenly too.  Makes me wonder about my alcoholic dad. He never went to the doctor. Passed away at 57 from cancer. Yep my dad was alcoholic too. And a brilliant eccentric  who lived in the bush so he  didn't  have to go anywhere, let alone the doc.
