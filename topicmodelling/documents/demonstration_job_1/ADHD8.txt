Trying to learn the interface at my new job and I’m crying because I feel so stupid. I watched the tutorial video twice. I feel like an idiot because It’s so confusing. I’m so frustrated.  Most interfaces are horribly designed.  The fact that they have a tutorial video tells me that it probably is a confusing, frustrating interface because they had to create a video to train people on it.

Take it easy on yourself, try to learn small pieces with lots of breaks.  Maybe you'll learn better by doing each step as soon as the tutorial explains it?  Pause the video, try it yourself, then play the video again?  Just some thoughts. ❤️❤️❤️ Take a brief break, then just try to get back at it. You’re not stupid. Lots of hugs. This isn't exactly the same thing, but I'm on a path to be a graphic designer and learning the adobe suite with ADHD is /grueling/. I always forget the hot keys and what button does what. However, I eventually spend so much time on it that I have internalized a lot of it. Learning things takes time, a LOT of time with ADHD, but I think the key is taking breaks like others have said as well as giving yourself the grace to watch tutorials as much as you need until you get there. I think sometimes we get caught up in a spiral of "Aaa this is taking too long! I bet everyone else got it on the first try! I'm so stupid, I hate myself for being like this". But if you think of it more as "Alright, let's learn this. It's gonna take a couple hundred views of this tutorial, but I'll get there", you might find yourself a lot less frustrated and able to better take in the information. :)  Learning something like that is tough for even neurotypicals.  Don't beat yourself up about it. Yeah also it’s an internet start up so it’s not like I have a boss I could call to help me.
