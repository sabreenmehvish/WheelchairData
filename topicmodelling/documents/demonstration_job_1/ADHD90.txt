Anyone diagnosed with Hyperkinetic adhd? Does medication help with this?  ....never heard of this. It's not a standard nomenclature used by the DSM-V? Or is this a non-US term?  not sure what standard nomenclature or dsm-v mean.

When I was young I was diagnosed with it, I just recently found my paperwork from the testing. It basically says that in addition to adhd and add, hyperkinetic disorder is 

"Hyperkinetic disorderÂ is a psychiatric neurodevelopmental condition emerging in early childhood that features an enduring pattern of severe, developmentally inappropriate symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity across different settings (e.g., home and school) that significantly impair academic, social and work performance"

When reading my childhood reports and the symptoms, it feels like it never went away. 

Wondering if I'm alone in this one.... I haven't been to a dr for this since I was very young. When I did go, my Mom was in charge of it all.

She changed my diet to Zero artificial flavors and zero artificial colors to try to fix it without meds. That alone must have been very challenging. 
I was also told that certain medications/items have the opposite reaction on me due to this.
Benadryl is like caffeine to me, coffee puts me to sleep, etc. The DSM-V is the book that defines the name, subtypes, symptoms, etc for any mental or cognitive abnormality.   
ADHD has three types: primarily inattentive (anecdotally called "ADD"), primarily hyperactive, and combination.

Based on your link, it appears that it's the international (WHO) term for ADHD-C. It's the first time I've seen that term here, but that's probably why. I think most of us are Americans (and Canucks) here.

And yeah, sometimes things will work weird, but it's not consistent to everyone. Me personally, coffee is coffee and benedryl is "passed the fuck out."   
Meanwhile it's Vyvanse that makes me curl up and nap all afternoon.  thank you!  Good bot this was in the 70s and not sure how well it worked except I hate carob to this day To add into things being inconsistent... coffee wakes me up a bit but an equivalent amount of caffeine from a different source does jack shit for me. Ah, okay. The lack of information in your post (age, etc) makes it a bit difficult to know the context of your situation.
