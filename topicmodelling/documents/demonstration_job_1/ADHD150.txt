Only way I get stuff done. Writing it all down. After trying all sorts of apps, methods, tools, ways of planning, etc. I've found that this layout of the daily to do list works out best for me. The numbers down the middle are times of day. The left side are side notes like what I've ate, meds, my mood or whatever else needs to be noted.  Basically this journal helps me keep track of what I need to get done and what I've actually got done. I look at this thing probably a 100 times a day, but it's the only thing solidly in front of me that will tell me the truth of how much time I've wasted or how productive I've been.

Edit: If you want the exact notebook I have, I bought mine from [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Medium-Notebook-Squared-LBL12/dp/B002CV5H4Y/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1425577362&sr=8-3&keywords=notebook+leuchtturm).

**The Pens** I use mostly Le Pen pens and sometimes Staedtler triplus fineliner or Stabilo point 88 fine 0.4 with a grey Pentel sign pen with a thicker brush tip to fill in my check boxes. I suggest just trying a bunch of pens until you feel something you like.  Might as well make this whole process somewhat fun.  The reason I use a grey pen most of the time to write out my lists is simply because it's not as bold as a black and I like the black for my dates at top or to reserve it for something that requires that boldness haha.  I'm sure you can come up with your own reasons for why you want to use the colors you want.  Whatever works for you. You can buy Le Pens on amazon, another great place to check out notebooks and other pens is [jetpens](http://jetpens.com)

**Building Habits** What might help is to first figure out the habits you want to start to have a more productive day. The idea here is to do them so often and all the time that you just know to do it and hopefully maybe just wont forget to do it someday.  One habit I tried for a while is drink green tea or yerba mate in the mornings, you might need to drink coffee or take your meds, etc.  I usually do a couple things, but writing out what you'd like to start doing in the AM and before bed in the PM is helpful.  You can even start new habits for a week and write down the results of if that habit was helpful on the left side.

What I write/ why:

* Stretch (Because it can help you wake up faster and what's wrong with being a little more flexible.)
* Wash Your Face (Even if you're not going anywhere, just feels better to do things with a fresh face.)
* Floss (Hey, dental health is important)
* Lotion Hands/ Feet (They're just too dry.) Well done. I find that out of all the apps, and alternative methods that writing it down the old fashioned way is the best method for me as well.  Can we all have a moment of appreciation for OP's handwriting? This is what Dr.Barkley recommends as well.  However, you should also have a smaller notebook that you can keep in your pocket or carry around with you easily.  That way you won't forget to look at it.  I keep a small notebook in my pocket and a weekly planner in my backpack. Looks like an effective system. Only now am I realizing just how much we are at a disadvantage with this disorder. The inability to remember basic information which we use everyday and how that translates into a considerably longer learning curve as what we learn today is forgotten by tomorrow.  I've also found that writing things on paper helps me. Typing something into my phone feels ephemeral and it gets lost, forgotten, or buried under notifications and distractions. I have a daily to-do-list ordered by time required ("hmm... I have 30 minutes until I need to leave. what can I fit in that time") and a traditional paper agenda. A good pen makes listing and completing tasks very tactile and enjoyable.

I like your method! I think I'll try something like it.

edit: what seeds are you starting? I'm planning to start my windowsill garden on the new moon this month :) I would like to adopt your system.  I have some questions.  I hope they haven't already been addressed.  Does the time also run horizontally on both sides until the hour is up?  What is the system with the colours? Wow this is really nicely organized. Looking at it let's me know I can do it! I can't show you my current planner in return though, sorry - you'd think I was a madman. I've also found that until something is written down or said out loud, it doesn't exist as anything more than another idea in the maelstrom. It gets lost pretty much right away.  Before smartphones, I would keep a little flip book in my back pocket. Now everything is in the calendars, makes life so much easier...that and auto bill pay. Pen and paper. The only way to go (for me). O have a planner, a to do list, a to buy list, a list of gifts to make friends, a to do list for specific events (vacation I'm taking soon, birthday parties, etc.). I even carry post its in my purse, my car, SO's car...  AWESOME system!! I really like that layout, and need to get myself back to pen and paper. I've tried all of these online solutions (Evernote, Trello, Wunderlist, Notepad, OneNote, Google Calendar) and end up forgetting to check or switching to a different system midstream and never remembering what my most current is. Then I end up with half & quarter-finished projects on my work computer, home laptop, dev computer, and across my desk and so overwhelmed that I can't figure out What exactly I wanted to do in the first place. 

TBH I also have four in-progress notebooks that I throw ideas into and forget about. I should mark the front of my notebook with a big note that says "USE THIS ONE" or something :P Leuchtturm Notebook? I was going to post to asking for people's journalling methods. I'm new to realizing I may have ADD or ADHD (going to be seeing a doctor soon), so this is really helpful! I've been printing off a list with checkboxes of things I have to do (like brush/shower etc), but I've forgotten to print out the list this week... I'm going to dedicate a notebook to this and follow your format! Thanks for posting, and the grid notebook is awesome! I basically do the same thing, but I use an actual day planner. My SO thinks it's odd that I add things like shower and laundry and eat, but otherwise I'll forget.  Even after smartphones, my iPhone uses too much battery to be considered reliable. I need backup paper and a pencil.  For a moment I thought it said to "defrost checks".  I really like this! You have very neat handwriting. I tend to scrawl everything out on a scrap paper and then transfer a neat list in the right order onto either my planner or my notepad with rip-off pages. 
 I couldn't keep at this notebook thing  All of the apps in the world won't replace my little black moleskin.  Every day I write a list of things to do and cross them off as I complete them. I am reading this and writing in my notebook right now. I keep a small notebook and pen everywhere I go and write down anything that comes to mind worth remembering. My grocery list, my to-do list, my research list, etc I write down in my notebook. I have also tried apps and besides google calendar for appointments and work schedule I only use my notebook. By the time I find my phone and go to enter things into my app I have already forgotten what I needed to put in it. Glad to see I'm not the only one who still uses this old-fashioned method. I love it and can't live without it I'm going to give this a try. I have the same notebook but usually I end up doodling.  A weekly pill holder will eliminate record keeping on that topic.https://www.google.com/search?q=weekly+pill+holder&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=RsD3VMsPg6-iBLWjgpgD&ved=0CCkQsAQ&biw=1429&bih=734 I'm with you on that. I just uninstalled any.do from my phone, I never use it anymore. I think it's was one of the last reminder apps on Google play I haven't tried! It seems like something works really well for a couple of weeks then I promptly forget about it. Lately I've been working on a way to take notes, track projects, and keep articles and I tried to use that for a planner and it hasn't been working out either. 

I'm going to go shop for a planner notebook and a smaller pocket one tonight.  I wonder if we would all have a particular gene that makes this so. I use the Calendar Widget for Android.  Hail to Le Pen. Can't wait to try this method! How much time do you spend making the list? Sometimes, my list making turns into an hour-long affair.  Which is why I still take notes with pen and paper in university.  I could never do notes on a tablet or laptop, it just wouldn't stick.  I feel more connected to what I write when it's by hand rather than electronic.  I'm a compulsive list-writer, too.  Not down to the times like OP, but I write down everything I have to do as soon as I think of needing to do it, or it'll never get done. It became kind of an obsession to keep finding apps that would be perfect and great for me, but then I spent way too much time trying to find that perfect app or buying apps and trying them for a week and hating it that I just went back to figuring out a system that would work for me and that meant just having this notebook.  Every day I'd try a different way of organizing the page until I found a method that worked best. I always wonder about my handwriting so thank you for liking it.  I forced myself to write in all caps when I started writing in this notebook so things would be easy to read. Do you keep that smaller notebook in your pocket? It sounds like a good idea but I have functional pockets about 30% of the time as a female. Not writing things down and not reviewing what I have to do really means I'm going to walk into different rooms and forget what it is I needed to do then get distracted from what I was currently doing to then again get distracted again and then the night is over and I've basically got nothing done. >Only now am I realizing just how much we are at a disadvantage with this disorder

If you hadn't noticed it before, maybe you're lucky and have a very mild version of ADHD. I can't even remember my birthday until someone else tells me. I've started some red onion seeds indoors.  So excited to start gardening this year that I ordered a bunch of strange seeds online like some sunflowers, weird looking carrots, a black watermelon- just excited to see what's going to work. Depending on when I think I'll wake up and go to bed, I'll start off with that number and write them vertically down the page, leaving some space between the numbers.  The blue at the top are the high and low temperatures of the day.  I personally like to know because then I know how much I have to bundle up before stepping outside, but I suppose you could also write in something else like maybe your goal of how many boxes you want to complete or one thing you'd like to focus on, etc. If I have something urgent and that I do not want to be late to, then I usually emphasize the time and what it is by writing it in red so it stands out the most. Vitamins/ supplements/ medicines or whatever I take often enough I will always just abbreviate with a few letters since I know what it is and I don't need it to take up too much writing space. I like using certain colors to group items, so for example on one of the pages I decided to use green for anything I ate, you can always customize to your liking.  It could also help if you wrote in the colors and what they correspond to so you're more organized and reminded to write with certain colors for certain things.  I've also been experimenting with writing some tasks further to the right if they aren't that important.  The pens I use the most are Le Pen, they just feel right. The reason I use the times are because then it is most easiest for me to loosely plan out having a full productive day.  If I see gaps in where I didn't complete things between certain times then I can have the guilt to motivate me for the next day.  Basically the times are there just as a guidline and if I still finish things at another time, I will still fill in my completed box. Ohh see I'm not showing you the first weeks pages of this notebook..it's quite embarrassing since it's me trying to figure out what's going to work or not work lol  I would loveee to see your madness though! Auto bill pay is great. I just have to remember to pay rent each month. And even then, sometimes I forget. : / Same! I also enjoy having [**this**](http://www.flex-a-chart.com/images/products/1%20month%20mag%20calendar%20aluminum.jpg) Haa I've used all of those.  It's my tendency to think there is always a better solution.  When I started this notebook I was obsessed with wanting it to be perfect, but I let go of that and decided that every day my page was going to be laid out differently.  After a couple months of trying different lay outs on different page and refining what I liked and didn't like, it just came together.  I have a bunch of random notebooks  as well  and I'll find them and every other page are random things I wanted to remember, but unfortunately I never got a chance to remember them because those notebooks or pieces of paper were in random places and I'd find them again at some random point in life.  I had to train myself to keep this one notebook with me glued to my side basically and not let myself write anywhere else haha.  I also converted to writing in all caps so my handwriting would be a quick and easy read. This has been an enormous process for me as well.  To try and prevent constant 'system-resetting' I have a set of procedures/rules I refer to very often.  It tells me WHY I'm doing it the way I currently am and is also an archive of how my methods have evolved.  So now when I think I have a better idea about my 'system' I'll go to revise my procedure for that thing and usually end up not changing anything because I'm reminded of my current 'why' that I impulsively forgot is actually just as good as if not better than this shiny new idea.  

It's very encouraging to be all excited to write down this new way of handling whatever and to be reminded that me of 6 months ago had that same idea but didn't implement it back then because of X and Y.  So instead of starting over like I always did I am reminded why my current way is best for me and it REINFORCES that habit I'm so desperately trying to build instead of replacing it with a new one that will surely fizzle.

We can tell ourselves a thousand times (and fully believe it) that it doesn't matter what 'system' we use as long as we consistently use it.  That doesn't stop some of us from forgetting that wisdom when we are overcome with an ingenious new way of doing something! My collection of always current 'procedures' has done a better job of keeping my approach consistent than anything else I've tried.

I use OneNote. Though again, the medium shouldn't matter too much.  

Some days I feel like the guy in Memento where I have have no clue what my step is without reading my little instructions to myself.  Some days I don't need them at all.

 Yep, great notebook, perfect size =)
 Coloured pens help for me, too. So I have one colour dedicated to each of my classes, one colour for bills (I write AMEX on the day it's due for example), one for personal appointments etc.  it's sad, but necessary.. I feel if I don't add shower I'll go a few days without showering =\  Or I'll never wash my face if I don't write it and then it gets all greasyy eww Unfortunately, my phone hates the cold weather so it tends to shut off sporadically.  I do still use the calendar app to have an extra reminder go off for an appointment, but I also write it down. yeah I do this thing, where I collect all my checks, freeze them until they're a nice size stack, then go cash them all at once after the defrost so I can feel rich. it's definitely hard at first, building habits and routines has always been pretty difficult, I guess you just need the motivation I've found that using apps leads to me getting distracted and looking at a bunch of other things.  At least with a notebook, you can only get distracted by yourself lol > https://www.google.com/search?q=weekly+pill+holder&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=RsD3VMsPg6-iBLWjgpgD&ved=0CCkQsAQ&biw=1429&bih=734

lol I have a pill holder, but I always forget to use it if I don't write things down so I just skip the part where I put the pills in the holder and just write them down and take them when I see it written down. I have the worst memory. I think I probably do spend an hour. Probably half an hour in the morning and half an hour before bed, but I don't mind sacrificing an hour if it gets me to actually get things done.  On days I don't look at my journal, I waste the whole day looking at other things like the tv, my phone, the computer..it goes on and on and on lol I'm big on lists as well. I even love my iPad and thought it'd be good for note taking, but alas, pen and legal pad seem to stick way better, using your hands is better than typing.  I started writing the times so that I could keep track of when I take my meds and how they did or didn't help me be productive =p I also list food or drinks to see maybe if that influenced my productivity in conjunction with my meds. Usually the left side of the times are dedicated to that then I plan out my day of things to do loosely on the right of the empty check boxes. Usually I just think of the times as a guideline of what I wanted to get done by what time, but if I get it done by another time I still check it off. If I have an appointment at a specific time I'll draw a line going from the time and write it in red to emphasize it. Typing lets me keep up with the notes faster, and then you just bold the things that you feel are important.  I have folders for each of my classes on my desktop with subfolders for daily notes, study guides, and the syllabus.  When I'm finished typing notes I will save them with the date as the filename.  Then, I will use online flash cards as well.  Saves me so many hand cramps! [deleted] That handwriting is beautiful. Seriously.  My friend is in the architecture program at my university, and they all have to take a class and write in caps just like this. Honestly looks nicer. I wish my penmanship was better. Great Handwriting BTW That's one of my main problems, too. If women's pants were more functional, this would totally work. 

It's not a problem at home -- I usually use a sheet of cardstock and a fat sharpie, and make my list in big letters and big checkboxes, so I can glance at it from far away (for me, filling in large boxes also feels more satisfying). 

At work, I tend to carry around either a binder, clipboard, or a stack of papers no matter what, so I just put my list there. 

When I'm not at home or work, I can almost guarantee that I will forget to do something important. :( Yes, I do.  However I'm a guy so it's easier for me.  I would suggest that you put it in your purse, but that probably won't help since you might just forget it there.  

Maybe you can use google calendar and set your smart phone to vibrate every hour or so to remind you to look at your schedule. Once forgot how old I was. Had to look it up on Facebook. (My best friend's birthday is a week before mine, and I thought for about five minutes that I was her age - that is, one year older than I was).  Oh, what fun ADHD is. ;) Well I dont doubt that my adhd is 'milder' than yours as I never had the issue of remembering my own birthdays. Nonetheless, I do not think that it was due to mildness that I realized this late in life, but rather, the assumption that it was normal; if not normal then I just assumed I had worse memory than others. 

But now after my diagnosis and having focused on it more, have I consciously realized the debilitating effects that traverse every single aspect of my life and the extent to which it affects me.

I think this is just one of many other things that I have always taken as being normal or 'just me' that I am now realizing is really a disorder which I have no real control over. I have started (for the last 3 weeks) doing this with a rhodia dotpad. Same size, but I just rip out one sheet a day and keep folded it in my pocket journal (leuchtturm).

Same sort of layout, but without the time stamps. But, I may steal your idea and give the time stamps a shot now :) I guess that is why they call it "cold, hard cash"! Discipline. That is straight fucking discipline you have demonstrated. Not motivation. A+ Winning. Gold medal to you. Seriously.  I refill mine before it gets empty and locate it so it's one of the first things I see when I wake up. Otherwise, I would definitely forget sometimes. I'm glad you found a system that works for you. So true! I meant about an hour each time I make a list (about two times a day, so 2 plus hours a day, lol). You are on what I consider the "dream level" of organization. :) Also, nothing beats that accomplished feeling of putting a big line through a completed task. ^^^Ahhhh... I have about 35 different notes in the Notes app on my phone.  Lists of all sorts, and a couple random prose pieces that I wanted to remember.  Those are helpful for non-university things, and the university things are in one of my planners.  I have a work planner, too.  It sounds delightfully organized and efficient :) I used to do online flash cards as well. They work for a lot of things and it's nice to be able to share them, but for my science classes I always found myself needing to draw pictures. What website did you use?

I used quizlet and if you wanted to add pix you had to pay for a subscription. yep have it and tried it =p   Thanks! My friend is an architect and I went to visit his office and found it satisfying to look at old blueprints.  Architects definitely have amazing handwriting, I was geeking out when I saw the handwriting on the blueprints and had to take pictures to keep on my phone lol. Yeah I agree, I don't have back pockets and at home it's not like I'm wearing a jacket indoors for me to keep my lists.  Now, I just make sure I have my one notebook with me all the time. When do you use the pocketbook? I've become a complete sucker for graph/ grid/ dot notepads. I think I have a rhodia dotpad just sitting on my shelf waiting for me to someday use it and I'm so nerdy about it I'll be super excited when I do finally start writing in it lol. Eh I try to be,  but the last two days I haven't checked that many boxes and I've ate horribly, chicken and waffles, fried green beans, an english muffin with nutella..ohh the list goes on!  I wrote it all down so I can look at it and feel extra guilty! That's funny you saw it at your friends firm; anyway, you nailed it.  At least once an hour.  I take a peak at it to make sure that I'm not forgetting to do an item on my list.  The point of the pocketbook is to write down just your to-do list for that specific day.  The weekly planner is meant for longer term plans.  If it's in your pocket, it's harder to forget about it. Argh, I *just* went to Office depot today, looked at the graph notepads, but couldn't decide how I would make them work. I think I'll be stealing your idea. Yeah office depot was disappointing in my area too.  If you don't mind waiting for shipping, [this is the exact notebook I have.](http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Medium-Notebook-Squared-LBL12/dp/B002CV5H4Y/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1425577362&sr=8-3&keywords=notebook+leuchtturm) I like it, thanks!
