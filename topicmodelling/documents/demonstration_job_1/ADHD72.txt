Work-alike to Google Calendar reminders which is less buggy on Android? Hey folks, so, my life kinda depends on GCal reminders, but Google Calendar is buggy and actually quite slow when you have many reminders per day. I'm wondering if there are any other apps which either work the same way, or actually work directly with the GCal back end to provide a different interface for the reminders.

I have repeating reminders that pop up at particular times of day (a must-have), which basically gives me a rolling to-do list in my phone's notifications. It's also nice to be able to go to GCal on the web and look at what fell off the bottom from time to time.

I actually use aCalendar for calendaring functions on my phone, but it doesn't seem to have reminders functionality, only tasks, which somehow isn't really the same thing. Or at least, not similar enough for my brain to be able to deal.

Thanks in advance for any pointers! Todoist is good imo, though I'm not much of a power user.

You can integrate it into your home screen like the attached.

Edit: turns out I don't know how to upload images to reddit, but w/e. I just use "Calendar Notifications", an open-source repetitive reminders app that works with any calendar that uses the Android calendar storage backend - GCal included.

Basically, it constantly annoys you until you acknowledge the event. You can specify the granularity and how annoying you want the application to be.

It has not been buggy for me at all, and I've been using it for over 2 years at this point. The worst I've found is a typo. Enjoy! :)
