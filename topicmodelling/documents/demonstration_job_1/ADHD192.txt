Did anyone here ever use IQTELL ? I miss it so much TLDR; RIP IQTELL. I would have paid for you forever. You were the one that got away. Your staff was genuinely awesome and I’ve never felt about an app as I felt about you. 
Shout out to the user forum people I miss you too. 

So many amazing features in one non-distracting atmosphere. If you are aware of it, what is most comparable on the market today? If you aren’t, here we’re my favorite features...

-It was the boss of integration - multiple email accounts could be operated internally, same with multiple calendars, google sheets, Evernote
-It was the king of hierarchy. Extremely raw and customizable. it took a while to learn how to use it only because the possibilities were endless and what you had to learn was less how it functions but how you were going to design it to function best for you. 
-Each feature had multiple ways of approaching/sorting items - tags, priority, time consumption, due date, etc. there were about 20 different categorizers that could be used within each feature. 
-Multiple types of organization all inter connected. Like a feature for to do lists, a feature for project management, feature for brainstorming.
-Links to create an item in any feature from any feature
-Team sharing complete with assigning tasks that synced as done once the other user marked it done. 
-Could run business and personal projects simultaneously or separately as needed
-Reminders via email or text
-Amazing support staff and user forum that was more of a community where people posted how-to’s and ideas on usage. App staff was also active members of the forum & always posting updates, ideas, and asking for feedback. You could tell they loved it too.
