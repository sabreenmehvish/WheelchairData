Tidy mind, tidy house So, here I am, sitting in my apartment and taking a look around.

Yesterday, I finally did what I wanted to do for two or three months already: I rearranged my whole apartment. I wanna get right to the question I have for you guys before getting to my thoughts / story about it:

**Do you sometimes get the urge to simply rearrange your furniture at home? And do you also become unproductive (at home) until you have done it? If so, why do you think this happens, what's your theory?**

I came to the realization that I get this urge to simply try out a new layout for my home on a yearly basis. It already dawned on me that this has become a weird ritual of mine, but not until recently, where i was reflection on it.

One day, I suddenly start to think: "*Yeah. I should switch things up. Maybe the bed in the other corner of the room? Maybe this, maybe that...*". This goes on for about 2-3 months until I do this, and usually I do it in one day. However, in the meantime where I just contemplate this idea, I feel like I become uber unproductive at home. It's like...I can't work on my private stuff at home, can't enjoy my hobbies at home, can't get arsed to tidy up properly. As if SOMETHING is holding me back, something that goes away once I've rearranged my apartment.

And the thing is: Everything was fine. I just moved into this new flat last year, and I planned it really well. It's small, but I managed to make it cozy and functional. 4 people can sleep here, I can invite up to 7-8 people for watching movies or playing games, I had two workspaces set up, I decorated the walls. It just worked and I was happy with it. Until this urge was rising up in me, seemingly out of nowhere.

Maybe it's the need for novelty? After all, routine and working systems do get boring after a while, right? Nothing new, nothing to fix, it's the same every day. Ugh...well, point is, next time I wanna try to do this right away, without 2-3 of just thinking about it. Because I didn't get anything done at home in this time (only private projects suffered, so it's not a HUGE problem, but it annoyed the ever living hell out of me.).

Hope this makes sense to some of you, would love to get some insight/other perspectives on this topic. I'm on the verge of ripping my entire bathroom apart and redoing it... It's all I can think about ATM. My husband is telling me it will cost me thousands... but it's super tiny and it just needs new paint and a new floor... It's doable on a budget... I get like this a lot... Redid my kitchen 7months ago after dwelling on it for months. 

I love the expression "outer order, inner calm". 
 I do this all the time! I've lived in my current apartment for three years and have rearranged the furniture in my room (barring my desser that's too heavy to move) at least 10 times.  usually my rationalization starts with trying to be more productive (maybe i'll work better if my desk is three feet closer to my window, etc.) but I've learned that l'm just very sensitive to my environment, and easily bored with my surroundings. It's cool to hear this from other people, too!  Every once and I while I get this compulsive drive to change the layout of my house and I can’t help but thinking of my demented childhood lovebird Lovey I (there was a subsequent Lovey II). 

There was an, uh, accident that left lovey a little... off. After the incident he would do things like detach his food and water holders and push them with his head along the along the bottom of his cage or take his toys and try to move them over an inch on a regular basis. He could never actually re-hook them to the wire though so he would just shout at us until we came by and did it for him. 

Whenever I find myself alone, pushing the giant sectional across the living room because my partner is at work but it needs to move NOW, I think of poor Lovey I lol I’m more impulsive when I’ve rearranged everything in my house all the time, for me it’s like I should move this here and I do and I go omg what didn’t I see this before this is way more functional how come I didn’t think to do this beds. A month later I move things around and say the same thing. I’m now dizzy from moving my shit around so much. Alls I want is my stuff to be it the perfect spot. My mom and brother are really good at doing things perfect. They find the perfect stop for everything and it never changes. There homes look amazing. I want my home to look amazing but I don’t where to put stuff it seems like I don’t have this but my best friend (who we both think has ADHD, though she’s not diagnosed) gets *exactly* this same way. The last time I was even starting to wonder if maybe it was an OCD type symptoms because it seems like she becomes quite literally obsessed with the project until she can carry it out. And that sense of happy satisfaction and energetic elation is definitely something she gets from the process as well. I wondered if it might be partially about seeking out that good feeling that comes afterwords… it sometimes seems that her redecorating frenzy’s come about as a way to escape from other obligations she’s not enjoying or to pull out of a depression. >It's all I can think about ATM

Annoying, isn't it? I wonder why that is, why the urge to do it won't subside, even after months. I mean, for me it seems like it's a NEED, because honestly: I got better things to do than this, I don't even WANT to do it because there's no (rational) sense behind it to me. I need that energy for my projects! Then again, I think next time I'm going to accept that I NEED to do this, because fighting the urge to do it takes WAY more energy than just doing it and won't work anyway eventually.

Also: After getting it done I feel SO damn good, it's like I'm full of energy again - most probably because I don't need to hold myself back on something every day. So it's not that I have more energy, but I don't waste the energy I have on holding myself back anymore. Feels good.

Also thank you for your answer. :) Ah yes, the rationalization...totally forgot I did that too when I was younger. I guess I was trying to convince myself that the change is needed for a more logical reason, so it doesn't feel so "random" anymore.

Thanks for sharing your experience! Don't wanna sound insensitive but: That's so cute! Thanks for sharing that story. :) I always have some conditions. Maybe this can help you? For example: I want to be able to have at least space for 6 people to sit on a table. I only want indirect lighting. I want the walls I look at when I sit on my couch to be decorated. I want my stereo in the corner of the room where I have no neighbours behind the wall.

With these conditions in mind I scribble a few (lets say 5) new Layouts. Just trying different things on paper, seeing what works and what doesn't. Shouldn't take longer than 15 Minutes (draw rectangle, put smaller rectangles or circles in it=layout). Then I choose one that i find interesting and go with it. If i realize it doesn't work out, well, I simply try another layout OR improvise when I "see" something I didn't see before.

All in all: A bit of planning might counter the "why didn't i think of this"? Just an idea. :) Heh, I was jokingly saying that this rearranging is my equivalent to "girls getting a new haircut after a breakup" to a friend the other day. There's been a lot of change in my life lately, so it MIGHT have to do with this. New me, new home or something. But I can't really confirm it, since I haven't monitored the circumstances when I rearranged my apt in the past.

I highly doubt that it is an escape. To quote myself from another answer:

>I wonder why that is, why the urge to do it won't subside, even after months.

And it definitely is annoying... I've got three kids to pay attention too, and classes to pass, and recently started job hunting... The worst possible time to get stuck on a home Reno project. Lol I’m going to try your idea, at the moment I don’t feel the need to move anything around but like I said I’ve move stuff so much it’s been evewhere possible at least once. I’m realizing having this discussion that I don’t plan things out and the thought of doing it makes me feel a little overwhelmed like I’m afraid I don’t know how to start or idk. That’s why I’m thinking Baby steps. I’ll follow your steps about rearranging furniture draw on a piece of paper. Thanks
