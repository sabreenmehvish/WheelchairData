What if it's not ADHD and I am just lazy/spacey? **TL;DR: Text in bold.**

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago I made a post here about having issues with focusing and someone asked if I have ADHD (I actually mentioned in the post that I don't have it because I associated ADHD with hyperactive kids and teenagers who can never focus, I didn't know hyperfocus is a thing). **I was very shocked to read and find out that I can relate with inattentive type, and how I could relate to a lot of women and their stories**. A quick research sadly told me there are no doctors in my (tiny, post-soviet) country that specialize in adult ADHD so I have to go to a random psychiatrist and hope they won't say it's not a thing

&#x200B;

But now that I have a visit scheduled I am worried that I might not have ADHD after all and it's just me and decades of bad habits. So these are things that make me wonder about having/not having it:

* I was the **dreaming kid, always in my own world, reading books for hours** and not interested in anything else in my free time, but I was also very smart, I learned to read and write at the age of four, I skipped the first grade because I already knew everything, **I was the "gifted kid"** and I don't think I had issues with focus. But my grandma was very strict so I kind of had to do things when I was told, I didn't have a choice of putting things off;
* Once we moved and lived in a separate house without my grandma, I had to manage my time myself (parents were super busy and all that), I remember **always doing homework at the last minute,** **often forgetting things** at home or school (books, homework, sports gear and so on), but I also never got into trouble because teachers liked me, they wrote off everything to 'she's just so busy' and I gladly accepted that
* In general, I did well in school, **I had As in all my final exams in high school**, **I could focus on exams,** and that's the thing - I could always focus in tests and exams, when under pressure, and never for homework or in class. The less time I had to do something - the better I did. Essays, big projects - **I did everything at the last minute, staying up all night.** And I always got As for those. My friends were always jealous but they never understood how much I tried to do things quicker and never could. And I knew I would do them better if I did them at the last minute anyway.
* Teachers were very forgiving, the **amount of time I forgot to do things was horrifying**, bet I was the super smart girl who takes part in maths national olympiad so I was always forgiven because everyone assumed I am studying like crazy, not once teachers said anything to my parents. And my parents assumed that I stay up until 1-2AM because of the amount of homework I have. Actually, it was because I could only force myself to do it at 1AM (if I remembered that I have homework). 
* **Uni was horrible, I went from As to failing classes** left and right. I could never focus on lectures at all. I couldn't do homework on time, and I was busy with learning to do Photoshop, with TV shows, fandoms, and other stuff that was more fun. I didn't go out to party, I wasn't missing classes because I slept in, I was just more interested in other stuff. I managed to do Uni for two years and then I realized I will not get a degree if I continue, so **I tried harder**. I still **did things at the last moment but I did them**. I tried to get my grades up. I remember I could not understand geometry class but I read the whole textbook the night before the final exam, finally understood it and got A in the exam. The professor actually thought I am cheating and asked me to do more things, I remember him asking me - if you are so smart how come you were failing my class? I had no answer. I graduated with As and Bs and my parents and friends were proud but none of them knew **I wrote my bachelor thesis in the last two weeks** (and got A again), and did all the essays and stuff at 3AM, few hours before deadlines. **I still managed to forget stuff a lot** but I also started to use phone reminders for everything.
* **I wrote my master thesis in 5 days, I barely slept or ate** or drank water but I did it. And guess what, I got A again. I had a whole year to write the thesis but I was working and **busy with more fun stuff** (writing, reading, music, graphic design). But as soon as I focused on the thesis in a panic, I could do them. I was so focused nothing could stop me. I kind of learned another language in those five days just so I could use some materials that were not available in English or my native language. 
* **I tried to work in the office but I never could focus, I got distracted,** I would open google to search for something I need and end up reading reddit and random articles I didn't need. I struggled but I never got fired or told off because I could do things at the last minute and I was fast when I actually had to do them. The task that took others 8 hours to do - I could do it in two hours, at the last minute and my bosses would be happy. **I was drowning in guilt and shame, feeling lazy and stupid for not being able to get my shit together.**
* I became self-employed and at first, I thought - yay, I don't have to worry about bosses and managers. But of course, **working from home requires even more disciple. I had none.** I spent six years, trying to do tasks and failing. I would always finish late, would stay up the night before to do them, I could never get 40 hours of work, my weekly time worked was around 20-30 hours (and honestly, it probably should be more like 15-20). **I could never focus, start on time, but whenever I finally did - I could do the task, I knew wasn't stupid, I was just lazy.** 
* I did struggle with finishing some tasks, **I would do the most interesting, challenging part**, but wouldn't want to do the finalizing, boring steps.
* And that's where I am right now, struggling to work as I should. I can get up in time, I can sit down at my desk in time, but somehow **I always end up doing other things instead of work.**
* I've always been told I am **super sensitive and emotional,** I cry a lot, and a sad song will make me teary-eyed. When I am happy, I am over the moon happy.
* I **never have anger issues.** I get scared when people are angry or shout. I want everyone to be happy. **I will do anything to make others happy**. I will randomly spend 100$ on a gift for a friend when they don't even have a birthday or anything, just because I saw the thing and thought it would make them happy. I want everyone to be happy and calm.
* I spend money **impulsively**. The amount of money spent on random things I never end up using is sad.
* **I am very organized, everything needs to be clean and not cluttered,** otherwise, it will distract me. That said, I will put off cleaning until the last minute and "I just need to sweep floors" will suddenly turn into a spring cleaning, **it's like I either don't do it or do it 110%**.
* **Without timers and reminders, I would burn my house down.** Last week I went out and was at the cafe when a timer in my phone told me that I need to take the lasagna out of the oven. I had to run home and hope for the best. I cannot leave the kitchen if I am cooking something. As soon as I am out of the kitchen, I forget about it.
* **I am always on time when I need to meet others.** I arrive 30 minutes before. I need five reminders to do it, but I do it because I am horrified of disappointing people. **That said, if I need to catch a train - I will be running and hoping I won't miss it**. I have missed trains and busses of course.
* **I need music when I do something,** I need podcasts when I clean, **I get bored if there is only one thing I need to focus on**. I can easily play a video game, listen to a podcast and chat with a friend (the last one will be a struggle and I will need to read what they said five times but I can do it). That said, I just talked with my sister and I didn't hear half of what she said because I started to read an article about ADHD.
* Small things like taking vitamins, brushing teeth, taking shower - **I need to do them now or it's not happening.** If I remember to take a shower, I need to stop everything and go take a shower. I cannot finish folding laundry and then take a shower, I will just forget it. I keep my multivitamin in front of my tea jar so I could remember taking it. 
* I was on antidepressants for six months, I had two reminders to take them and I did it well but mostly because I was scared of suddenly stopping and skipping a dose. At the same time, when I had to take meds for pain, I would always forget them because, in my head, nothing bad will happen if I skip it.
* **I change hobbies like socks**. I will decide I want to learn to draw, research it, order books and supplies and then get bored in two weeks. Then I will want to learn to play guitar, learn a language, learn skateboarding and so on. **I am so indecisive, I cannot even choose my favorite color**. Making decisions is horrifying. I don't even know why.
* **I am not hyper. At all.** I will gladly become one with my sofa.
* **I am not disorganized. I do not forget birthdays** (I have reminders!). I am getting better with money because I've been using a budgeting tool for the past two years. I have a paper planner that helps me to remember things. I don't know if this means I don't have ADHD or that I have just learned how to deal with some of it.
* **I am single because I would never ever let anyone close to me.** Not that I don't want to but because they would find out how lazy I am, how I cannot do anything like a normal person. None of my friends know I struggle, everyone thinks I work late because I work overtime. If I haven't done anything during the week and work on Sunday because Monday 9AM is my deadline, they will be worried I work so much, and I let them believe it because **I don't want anyone to find out. I have put on a mask of being successful, smart and productive and I feel like I can't do it anymore. It's too hard and I am failing anyway.** I suspect my current partner will break the contract with me because I haven't done half of what I had to do this year. 
* I can ace a test like "press this button when you see 2" because I am good at video games, and because I want to do well when someone is evaluating me. Ask me to do it when I am alone at home and I will go and make tea halfway through the test. Basically, **my biggest issue is, that once I decide to focus, I can**. **It's just that I can't decide to focus unless my life depends on it**.
* It took me three hours to write this because I wanted to do other stuff in between.

So yeah that's where I am. Part of me is sad that if it's ADHD, I could have had a different life if I knew. Part of me is happy that I might not be just lazy and spacy. Part of me is terrified it's not ADHD and I will never achieve anything. I am already worried I won't find a doctor who believes in adult ADHD but I am even more worried that as soon as I tell that I am not hyper and was a smart kid, they will write me off without even trying. And maybe they are right?

&#x200B; Just chiming in, only read the title.

 I personally do not believe in the concept of lazy or spacey. There is a reason for being "lazy" or "spacey". You are not lazy just to be lazy. You are not spacey because you like to be spacey. There is something off. Be it your brain, energy levels, brain chemical imbalance, hormones, genetics, innate personality, whatever else. You are not the reason you are like this. You don't want to be like this, right? You are not lazy or spacey by choice like everyone around you wants to make you believe, because they can't comprehend you due to the fact they don't have these problems. There are things you can do that will help you live with your problems, but it's not your fault you have them and you can't just get rid of them. You have described my life. From miraculously succeeding at school, to feeling like a fraud at work, to people thinking I am organized, to always wanting to please people and worrying about disappointing them. I was also a spacey kid, never hyperactive. When my two children were diagnosed, I started to suspect I had it too. In recent years my job (which I have been doing for over 20 years now!) has become more of a struggle. Luckily for me, my doctor had no doubt that I am ADHD and has prescribed Strattera. It’s only been two weeks and I have not noticed much of a difference (other than terrible insomnia) but I am hoping it will kick in in about a month and that the insomnia will go away. Fingers crossed, because I don’t think I can make myself focus, no matter how much I try.  Something is a diagnosis because it prevents the patient from functioning as expected. The diagnosis is not the goal but informs how you can restore/support the desired functioning. 

Tell the doctor the problems you have with functioning as expected (a written list is good. Print out this post to bring along) and keep your focus on addressing those issues. If your question is "Do I have ADHD?" then the doctor can give a yes or no and be done with it. If the focus is on your ability to function then the doctor still has a problem to solve if they say it's not ADHD.  Spacey with ADHD: Clear reasons for this
Spacey without ADHD: This isn't normal and something medical is contributing to this

Lazy: *Needs to scoop the litter box* I'm not doing that right now. I don't want to. *Binge watches netflix and doesn't think about not scooping the litter*

AHDD: *Needs to scoop the litter box* *paralysis of will and anxiety.* I can't do that right now. I'm too tired. I'll do it later. *feels bad about not being able to do it* *a week goes by* OMG I have to clean it now. why do i do this to myself and make it hard. why can't i just do a little bit each day so that it's easy each time?! *sobs* *repeats next week or week after* Wow. I describe my experience (well, 90% of it). Down to being in a backwards country that doesn't really believe in adult ADHD and thus being hesitant to go for a diagnosis. What if I'm just medicalizing a "normal" issue?  The 'always wanting to please people' is an interesting aspect I've seen a lot of people here mention. I wonder if it stems from feelings of inadequacy due to the struggles of trying to function like other people seem to be able to, and wanting to prove yourself in some way? To prove that you're trying, that you're a good person who deserves respect and compassion for making an effort? Just responding to the title: Then stop being lazy. It's that simple. If it's not that simple them there must be something else going on. Could be ADHD, could be something else. I don't know enough to tell you.

  


I've had these thoughts so often. Been told that's the case my whole life so I would put in a ton of effort, progress, burn out, fail. Square one is a very familiar place for me. But since being diagnosed, learning as much as I can about ADHD and approaching everything with it in mind I can finally say I know I'm not lazy. I'm getting so much done. Not always everything that needs to be done mind you but enough that my life is starting to come together.

  


If it turns out you do have ADHD my advice is not to fight it. Work with it. I'm now pretty much convinced that calling it a disorder is the wrong way to look at it. We have a different balance of mental faculties. Unfortunately we are a little deficient in the ones that society expects us all to have but a lot of the problem comes from insisting that we should have them. I have tried my whole life to deal with my sleep issues, worked jobs that require me to be able to wake up in the morning and just ended up stressed, unhealthy, unhappy and eventually get fired for it anyway because I can't rewire my brain. Now I sell stuff on eBay for a living. I'm good at finding deals because it's a dopamine rush so I use that to my advantage to buy stuff at a price I can make a profit on. If I'm interested in something I deep dive which means I have a great product knowledge. I know what makes one thing more valuable than another so long as it's a thing I'm interested in. If I'm not interested, I don't buy it.

  


Not to say you need to start your own business to do well with ADHD, just figure out what your own personal strengths and weaknesses are and use that to your advantage. And when you figure out what those are, don't let other people convince you that's wrong because their experience is different. They mean well but they don't get it and you'll drive yourself crazy trying to make everyone understand. What I'm trying to say is get to know yourself as well as you can and live your own life, not the one you've been told you should have. Yes you have ADHD.

Its not something that can be blood tested, it has to do with how much it's impacting your life. Everyone is forgetful now and then but if inattentiveness, impulsivity, emotional reactivity, distractedness, poor time management etc is impacting your life a lot then that's probably ADHD. Sounds like you already have a lot of amazing coping skills! Watch this: [Am I lazy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUsotGVqUy4) Sounds exactly like me, it is just not textbook Adhd. But it does sound a lot like me, and I have accepted that whether I have Adhd or something else, stimulants help me function like neurotypical people. 
Things just lose their novelty to the point where one can't function in society without medication. 

The world just can't deliver the level of excitement that we need because things just lose their novelty. We always want NEW AND SHINY or we become depressed.

I don't dare say that I am even a smother as sharp as sherlock Holmes, and I don't imply that he has Adhd, but he does drugs we he doesn't have a case, because a regular life doesn't stimulate him enough in the slightest.

One great advice I have for you is to see things that will bring you good in the future as something positive and try to channel some excitement into it because you are doing something nice for yourself and taking responsibility.

 Skimmed over it, 2 thoughts: ADHD is diagnosed based on patterns over your whole life but having many similarities hints that you have it, and hyper doesn’t mean what you think it does. Also, how old are you? Good luck with diagnosis and improving I feel you exactly on every point except that I have combined type so while I can control my activity, I feel like I am driven by a motor and I need to go go go all the time. (Except for when I am burnt out and depressed, then nothing gets done and I feel even worse about it.) I have been feeling like I can NOT keep going like this. Like I can get stuff done but it costs me so much and it makes it so I can't actually do everything I want to get done. 

Anyway, I literally just got my diagnosis a few days ago and today is my first day on meds, starting on 5 mg Adderall, and I feel like maybe I can do this. You should absolutely go to a psychologist and pursue a diagnosis. I am not going to say one way or another because IANAD, but your insight is very important and it matters a lot if you think it's a possibility. The psychologist I saw was impressed by my intelligence and self-awareness and worked with me on my diagnosis, listening to my insight and discussing all possibilities with me. 

Also, check out Ellen B Littman's research if you haven't already. She has a lot of great stuff on ADHD in girls and women, especially on inattentive type.  Hmmmmmmmm okay I read this a few times over in full. 

Although you do have some red flaggish symptoms, they do not correlate across the board. 

For example youre impulsive in the things you buy, however you are single because you have no one close to you, strongly indicating you are not impulsive as a person. You do not give away any information and you can control your speech. People with ADHD are impulsive across the board. 

Another example, you claim to do everything last minute yet are incredibly organised in cleaning York room Ans showering etc. Yet again, people with ADHD tend to procrastinate on, no matter how important. 

You seem to love doing of what is in your interest yet those with ADHD struggle with doing the things they like, (they procrastinate on that too!!) 

Im not saying you don't have it, you may as well have it, but it's a spectrum, And you are probably at the lower end. Since you do everything last minute and get great results your brain has hardwired to work only that way, it'll be a hard change since you have been doing it for so long but that's all I can say. 

Why do you need to put unessessary drugs into your life when the problem may not even be ADHD and just a lifestyle choice? Ask yourself this, what will being diagnosed do for you. Because I assure you it will not change your grades or your lifestyle as you seem to be super organised anyway.  I just wanted to say that m'y story us very similar to yours. i skipped my first grade cause I knew hos to Read , everything came easily to me in school. I was always so distracted though and disorganized (at school I handed out messy homework it doesn't even make sense ) , since I was a child I was always losing everything (still am) and I was diagnosed with ADHD two weeks ago and it feel so good. To the same extent: I'm not really sure lazy exists. Fully neurotypical people who look out at society, perfectly aware of their place in it, and fully cogniscent of all the consequences, just decide to be lazy anyway, to heck with the consequences?

Nah. Ignorant, or distressed, or with very low motivation, or with a blindspot for consequences that they understand but don't really perceive on an intuitive level? Now we're talking.

If it walks like ADHD and quacks like ADHD...

I think we're just as susceptible as others for believing BS about ourselves, and recognising that has the secondary effect of saying "but what if that recognition is BS!?" - astutely meta, but not exactly helpful.

For me it's usually varying between racing self-doubt or absolutely forgetting to even entertain the notion of doubt. (Forgetful about due diligence, etc.)

But at that, it's totally ADHD, in my estimation of the OP's post. And if not ADHD, it's not 'just lazy' - though someone has to be in the lowest percentiles of 'Conscientiousness' on the Big 5, no matter the underlying differences, those with higher scores will likely always see the lower orders as lazy - because you can't perceive the inside workings. It's sort of the definition of the scale.

But thinking "I'm just lazy" is getting things the wrong way round. Other people can think you're lazy, but to hell with them. You've (err, we've all hereabouts!) got enough to get on with without adding that too. :D

The real question, diagnosis aside, is 'will ADHD-style strategies help better than alternatives?'. I don't think good strategies exist for the generically lazy. Commonly its 'buck up your ideas!', but that does look especially effective or reliable. No, I don't want to be like this, you're right. 

I guess I just have a hard time understanding what I can or cannot control. Most of the time I feel like my brain is split in two - part of me really wants to do well, be productive, achieve my goals, and then the other part constantly wants to only do fun, interesting things, jumps from one to the other, and when I finally get to doing work stuff, the first part is so upset that I end up doing it 110%. I remember how I had to do small essays in Uni that wouldn't even be graded for one class, you just had to write them. I would always end up starting at 3-4AM the night before it was due. And I would write an essay so good that my professor would laugh that I clearly don't know how to write 'just good enough' like everyone else, he even gave me As for some of them because he felt bad for how much time "I've clearly have spent". I don't know, maybe it's just perfectionism or something. 

Thank you for saying that, I don't think ADHD is an excuse I can use to say 'it wasn't me, it was always ADHD' but I've always blamed myself for being such a failure. So yeah... thank you! 

&#x200B; >Just chiming in, only read the title.

You don't need to say that here, you're among family. >innate personality

I think when people talk about laziness this is what they are referring to. This is a perfect description of how I feel: "miraculously succeeding at school, to feeling like a fraud at work, to people thinking I am organized, to always wanting to please people and worrying about disappointing them", thank you for summing it for me. 

I hope you can figure it out with your meds and that they will improve your life!  That is such a good point! I guess I was stuck on "either it's ADHD or I am hopeless". I could ask the doctor what to do even if it's not ADHD because clearly, I need help. Thank you so much, this makes me way less worried about the appointment!  I have a cat and this is literally my life. You actually made me laugh, thank you! :D Did you go to a doctor or not? 

I told a friend I am going (I didn't tell what for) and that I am worried the doctor won't even know the condition. And she just said "so what? there are more doctors you can go to!" and she's right. If I really want to, I can go to every single doctor in this country or find an online doctor. I am not looking for medication even, I mostly wanted the diagnosis so I could get therapy or find ADHD coach, just someone that can help me. But a few people here pointed out that even if it's not ADHD, your doctor can still help you figure out how to deal with the issues you have. Not having ADHD is not equal to "well, you don't have any problems, go home".  I know for me it's because I want people to love me and want to look normal. If I don't upset my boss, my hairdresser (who totally didn't do my hair as I asked) or even a random stranger on the street (who will ask me to borrow money), everyone will see me as a "good person" and will never find out I am secretly a fraud. It's not that I am faking being a good person, I really want to please everyone. As long as everyone is happy, I can pretend things are fine. I think that's why I am also scared of anger. I am scared someone will tell me off or tell me they know I am lazy and can't do things right. I just want to be good at something, even if it's just making others happy. I have been told a lot I put other people happiness over mine, and I do, but most of the time I feel like that's the only thing I am good at so I don't want to stop doing it. People with ADHD often have poor personal boundaries, poor self esteem and are people pleasers Thank you for your perspective! I've gotten so many replies I don't even know how to thank everyone. 

You are right about being lazy, I've tried to not be lazy for decades. Although I guess, lazy is a bad word. It's not that I am actually lazy if I think about it, I get a lot done during the day, it's just not the things I planned or should have done. 

Before someone pointed out ADHD to me, I just never realized that no matter what the diagnosis is, I've been wrongly assuming that I've chosen to be like I am. I know I've tried really had to be less "lazy and spacey", I just always assumed I am not trying hard enough and therefore I am a bad person/failure. Researching ADHD made me realize that with or without it, my brain is still a bit different than "normal" brains are, so that's giving me some peace. I know I can ask for help even if it's not ADHD.

You're making some really good points. I don't even know if I can fight it assuming I've had it for almost 30 years. I have accepted that I might never be able to focus on a boring work report for an hour, but I've been playing with various techniques in the past few weeks that seem to help, like reward myself for time spent on boring stuff every 30 minutes. I've played a lot of video games this week but I also got more done this week than in the past few months. :D But I have a feeling that you are right, I've been wondering for the past two years if I am in the right field, doing the right stuff. I love programming and challenging tasks but the tasks I have to do on a daily basis are nothing that interests me. I don't want to make any radical changes right now but this is something I need to think about. I am really exhausted of trying to fit in the box that is clearly not meant for me.  It's horribly impacting my life. And you just gave me a really good argument/statement I need to tell my doctor. No matter what it is, even if they say it's not ADHD, there is something wrong that is massively impacting my life that I need help with. Thank you! I watched it, the channel was actually amazing to educate myself on what ADHD is. When I watch the video or others, I am sure I do have ADHD but an hour or so later my mind will come up with "but you never forget your friends birthdays or people's names! remember, it was a symptom, so it must not be ADHD!" and I start to doubt everything. Siiigh. Even if I get a diagnosis, I don’t think I can get medication, maybe I am wrong but in my country you have to go through fire and water just to get antidepressants let alone something more serious. I will be lucky if I can find a therapist. 

That said, I can see your point. I actually like programming so when I get assigned a really hard task that is hard to solve, I get excited and I can focus when I am challenged. But as soon as I have to do something “average” or something similar to what I’ve done in the past, I am struggling to focus on the task. Thank you!  Almost 30 years old. I think this discussion and many lovely comments made me realize that with or without ADHD these are still problems that I can ask help for. Up until someone pointed out it might be ADHD, I never thought about it, just assumed I am broken and that’s it.

What would you describe hyper is? Congratulations on getting a diagnosis and being on a new path! Knowing how horrible it feels trying and failing to be and do better, I am happy for everyone who can get help!

I will try to pursue a diagnosis, even if it's not ADHD, it must be something. Some of the other replies made me realize I still can ask for help even if it's not ADHD. I just needed to realize that I am not choosing to be like this and have been trying to improve for decades so I should get some help. I think instead of trying to prove to a doctor that I have ADHD, I need to tell them that with or without it, I really need their help. That makes me more hopeful actually. 

I don't think I have checked her stuff unless I missed her name, but thank you for recommending that!

&#x200B; I am not sure how to answer this so it doesn't sound like I am defending myself because I already said that I am not sure it's ADHD, you might be right there and your viewpoint is just as valid as anyone else's here. But when I say that I am organized and my house is clean - I don't mean it's like that all the time. I do procrastinate on cleaning and organizing, I just own very little (very, *very* minimalist) so there is not much that I can disorganize. It's more that I have adapted over years, e.g., I clean dishes as soon as I finish eating because otherwise, they will pile up in the sink for days or weeks. I vacuum floors once a week because my friends come over on Fridays and I am terrified they will see dirty floors and won't be my friends. I also got rid of most of my stuff because otherwise, I had piles of stuff everywhere. Now when I am minimalist, it's easier. And I do struggle with doing what I love and focusing on it as well, I was just playing Civilization 6, but originally I wanted to listen to a playlist I made on Spotify, but somehow I am on reddit and also just watched a YouTube video about Air Ambulance in UK.  It's just sometimes, if I really get into it (maybe hyperfocus?), I can play Civilization for hours and hours. 

I know you are trying to help and give a different point of view, which I appreciate, but saying it's a lifestyle choice is just like saying I am lazy. I have been fighting myself for years to not be the way I am or do things the way I do them. I wish I could just choose, but it's like half of my brain is not interested in what I want and is controlling the wheel of my life while I scream in the backseat.

All that said, I already said in other comments that I don't actually want "unnecessary drugs", I don't really care to be medicated, I am more interested in *why* I am the way I am and what can I do about it - therapy, new techniques etc. But since a few days after making this thread, I went to a doctor and found out adult ADHD is not a diagnosis available in my country, it doesn't matter anyway. I have more or less given up on fixing things since ADHD was my last option. So, no unnecessary drugs or fake ADHD diagnosis for me. 

This is a really old thread so I didn't expect any answers and haven't updated it with the current situation, sorry if I have wasted your time in any way.  I think it's interesting how reluctant people seem to be to associate negative 'personality traits' with impaired brain functioning, and instead make it into a moral judgment.

This is very strange considering we know how severely the balance of neurotransmitters and hormones can affect the way we behave. For instance, most humans become extremely lazy at night on a daily basis, often spending many hours doing nothing but lying down and not making the effort to function ;) 

Or, similarly, if you miss a night of sleep and feel exhausted, is that because you've suddenly become lazier overnight? How would you feel if you lived in a world where nobody needed sleep, expected you to be able to manage without it too, and didn't understand why you were so tired all the time? You'd rightly feel pretty isolated and depressed, on top of the exhaustion.
 Probably. Still, like other things I've mentioned, it can't really be rid of. You can live with it, compensate for it, forcefully try to change it, but it costs a lot of energy and effort that normal people do not ever need to put. And you're probably going to need to keep up that approach forever. With nothing that shows up on a blood test or x-ray, etc., the only way for them to know whether the problem is adequately addressed is by what you tell them. Interesting. I can relate to a lot of that. Wow, you explained it so well.

For me personally, sometimes I think it's also like I feel like <I>I</i> don't have a chance at being happy, so I might as well work on making other people happy.  I think you're wise not to make any hasty decisions. You're still figuring a lot out so little steps are the best way to go. I was diagnosed at 28 and I'm about to turn 31. It's been a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster but in the last six months to a year I feel like I've gotten my head around the problem. At least to the degree that I have an approach that works for me.

You do have to do stuff that you find tedious unfortunately as no amount of understanding yourself is going to make you enjoy those things and they need to be done. I personally found that a lot of these little productivity techniques work for a while as they trigger a dopamine release when they work but as time goes on the novelty wears off and you find it less and less effective. Don't stop if it's working for you but pay attention to how you feel when you're getting stuff done. There seems to be a kind of exhaustion that never gets talked about as most people very rarely reach it and so aren't aware of it. This makes it very difficult to talk about as we don't really have the vocabulary to address it so we end up calling it the wrong thing. If you call it laziness then you make that the issue you're trying to solve and come up with the wrong solutions. I haven't heard it given a name so I've been calling it "directional exhaustion" as it seems to come about when you're trying to keep yourself on track. Next time you find yourself struggling to stay on task pay attention to how that feels. Take note of when it starts to become a noticeable effort, when it becomes a real challenge and when it becomes absolutely impossible. You need to figure out where the tipping point is and not feel guilty for giving yourself a break when you know you're approaching it.

I don't know if you do much in the way of exercise but I think it's the perfect analogy. I used to cycle a lot and I'm a big guy. If I was cycling uphill I could often power up it. I got up a lot of hills by sheer force of will but you reach a point where you just don't have anything left. I've been in the situation where, even though the hill is starting to level off and get easier, I've used up all my energy and literally cannot turn the pedals any more. When I let myself get to that point I wouldn't fully recover for a few days. I'd maybe be able to get back on the bike after twenty minutes of gasping for breath at the side of the road but I'd go at half the speed and be in agony until I'd fully rested and may not be able to get up the hill. I became a much better cyclist when I learned to notice when my legs were burning too much to recover. If I was already in the lowest gear and struggling then I would have to stop. I could force myself to go further but it was better to accept that I'd reached my limit, take a break for five minutes then finish the climb than go to the point where I have no choice but to stop for twenty then roll back down the hill in defeat. It's the same kind of awareness you need to avoid "directional exhaustion".

As for getting started in the first place I try not to over-commit. If I know I need to do something but can't face it or find myself putting it off by five minutes all day I'll figure out what the smallest step towards that task is and allow myself to stop after that. A lot of the time you gain momentum and end up doing a lot more than what you initially committed to without having to force yourself. If not then that's fine but I need to make sure I've figured out what the next small step is before I decide not to take it. If I can't face doing it now then I already have my first step planned out for next time. Next time might be in five minutes or it might be in a couple of days.

ADHD affects every area of my life but that's my approach to productivity. Hopefully that's of some use to you. If so then what I said about these techniques becoming less effective as the novelty wears off probably applies here too so keep that in mind. The important thing is gaining an understanding of your abilities and limitations and develop your own approach. Keep reading up on ADHD, find out the components of it and watch yourself through those lenses. You'll find some seem to apply more than others and this will help you zero in on the specific issues that you need to find solutions for. You sound like a smart person so I'm sure you'd come to this conclusion on your own. I'm just trying to get the point across that there's not something wrong with you that needs fixed, you just need to learn how to operate your brain properly and unfortunately there aren't any shortcuts. Good luck! Remember, whether or not it can be categorized as ADHD, or whatever, you know who you are and you know that you can tend to struggle with certain things. It is not necessarily all about getting the diagnosis (although it can help with medication and targeted therapy), it is also about identifying your personal issues and shortcomings and continually working towards improvement. I, for one, never took my problems very seriously before the diagnosis - which I now realize was a mistake. I recommend you to take small steps of action everyday and see if you can slowly improve on specific things. Ask yourself everyday: "Why did that problem arise? What can I do to not letting it happen again?".

Remember that everyone is different and have their own problems and think they are worse than everyone else's. The cool people are the one who deal with it and try their best to fight their demons. When they fail, they get up, adjust, and try again. That's my personal idea of success; accepting that every day failures are an important part of the journey towards reaching your goals. I agonized over the same questions. Still have doubts, actually. For me it was "but you never lose things and you did well on tests". Turns out I do lose things, I just don't stress about it, or I don't lose them because I learned long before diagnosis how to minimize it for certain items. With tests, I think I would hyperfocus on the test until it was done and checked for the stupid errors I always made.

But, I got my meds and when I found they worked as expected for ADHD, that pretty much removed all (okay, most) of my doubt.  Tony Robbins had a podcast episode regarding [this](https://gretchenrubin.com/2015/01/ta-da-the-launch-of-my-quiz-on-the-four-tendencies-learn-about-yourself/), and now a lot of those inconsistencies (ie: only coming through when it's someone else expecting you to VS internal motivation, etc) make total sense. Not the same person but I’ll jump in some I had the same thought as them - being hyperactive isn’t just “I can’t sit down for long periods of time”; that’s more like one extreme end of the scale. Hyper could also be things like fidgeting, bouncing your leg, doing something with your hands while you watch tv, stuff like that that’s small and not really disruptive. Hyper could also be situational - for example, if you put me in front of a good tv show I will sit still without moving for hours, but if my mind is trying to daydream I will often walk around because it’s just easier to think clearly if I’m walking. Or I might be able to sit still for a while but I’ll just sit in a weird position. 

The thing to understand is that adhd was named very poorly and “being hyper” is just a symptom - the real cause behind hyperactivity is poor impulse control and/or lack of stimulation. With the walking while daydreaming example, mental stimulation where it’s all inside my head isn’t enough to keep me from getting bored, I need physical input too so I walk. Or in the classic case of a hyper little boy who can’t sit still in class, his impulse control is very poor so he jumps out of his seat simply because he can and his brain can’t stop him from doing it. 

So with that in mind, things like “spending lots of money without thinking” is a symptom of poor impulse control just like hyperactivity is, or “needing deadline pressure to focus” could be a symptom of needing enough stimulation to make a task not boring. 

On the flip side, wanting to become one with the couch is as iconically adhd as hyperactivity. Again, it’s a symptom, and the issue this time is one of inertia - we have a difficult time changing tasks! You’re on the couch, it’s easy to stay ok the couch and hard to get up, so you stay. You have a task to do but it’s easier to not do it so you don’t. Even hyperfocus is a symptom of this - once you’re focused on something it’s easier to stay focused than let other info in! 

You may have encountered this notion in your research, but adhd should have been named “executive dysfunction disorder”. Hyperactivity, attention deficit, hyper focus, inertia - these are all just symptoms. Impulse control, switching tasks, decision making, planning ahead - these are the “executive functions” controlled by one section of the brain, and that’s the section of the brain that is underdeveloped in folks with adhd. If you think of any of our symptoms they can typically be traced back to a failure of one of our executive functions. 

Sorry to ramble, hopefully that makes sense and answers your question???? You are so right. I had the same thing with depression, I wanted to know if I have it, but then, even when my doctor told me she thins I have it and gave me antidepressants, I still felt like 'what if she was wrong'. Thank you again!  YES! And it's like happiness by proxy, if I cannot be happy myself, I can get some happiness echo from people I make happy.

Thinking about this actually makes me sad, if I was any other person, I would do anything to make that other person happy, but somehow I cannot do it for myself, have just resigned it won't ever happen. If my friend, sister or even a stranger on the internet would tell me they think they have ADHD and these are their issues, I would try anything and everything to help them. But helping myself? Nope. I just replied to someone else saying " That is such a good point! I guess I was stuck on "either it's ADHD or I am hopeless" and I want to say it again. I think I have a hard time believing I can be "fixed" because I've tried and failed all my life to be better. So knowing that it might be ADHD and therefore I have options like therapy and ADHD advice books, podcasts, etc. makes me feel hopeful, and that I might have just not tried the right methods in the past. But your post made me think about how it might not be ADHD but I still might succeed with trying something else. 

I think I just don't believe in myself anymore, even though I have fixed some issues (for example, impulsive money spending has stopped because I started to budget, I am better with my time because of multiple sets of reminders on my phone, I don't lose things since I minimized my house down), it has taken me a decade to do just that. And I am already almost 30 so it feels like I can never solve the main issue. But I should use doctor's help/therapy/coach/new strategies even if it's not ADHD instead of giving up. Yup, I am the same. I never lose things but I also live a minimalist lifestyle, I have one shelf and one clothing rack, it's hard to lose things. I think I can do well on tests because they challenge me. Tests are new and shiny and something where I need to prove to everyone that I am "normal" so I can focus really well. 

I got so many amazing responses on this thread that are helping so much. I realized that in a way it's not super important if it's ADHD or not, I still need help and a doctor should help me figure out why I am the way I am. At the same time, it would be nice to say 'it's ADHD' because then I have a more specific reason than just 'for some reason I have all these issues'. Thank you so much! I can relate to sitting in weird positions and fidgeting (I usually shake my crossed foot or will drum my fingers when listening to a song, but never in public), although all of these are things I do as an adult. I don't remember being hyper as a kid or a teenager. And nobody ever pointed it out to me, I would remember since I remember every time someone said something negative about me. :D

I never realized hyperactivity comes from impulse control, but what you explained makes total sense. There is so much to learn (even if it's not ADHD), I never realized that my lack of focus could come from something related to brain function, I always assumed that I am choosing to be like that. Which, thinking back, makes no sense, since I was desperately trying for years to be "normal". 

&#x200B; I agree it changes everything once you learn what adhd actually is! No one *wants* to be lazy but it’s so hard to understand the feeling of “I just can’t make myself move” if you haven’t experienced it yourself, and even if you have experienced it it’s still hard to really comprehend or explain well. It’s not something fully in our control though, or at the very least it takes us much more energy to push past it than it for for other people. 

If you haven’t already, you should check out Dr Russell Barkley’s lecture series on adhd on YouTube (i would add a link but I’m on mobile at work sorry). It’s really interesting and informative, and I feel like it really opened my eyes to what adhd is and changed how I felt about myself in a positive way.
