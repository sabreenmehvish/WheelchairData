Anyone feel like light colors help you focus? My office just moved and my old black and wood desk in front of a colored wall was switched to a white one with a white wall being it, which came with a ton of clear acrylic files and such instead of my old black metal ones.

I was upset at first because, you know, boring white, but I've noticed since the change I have an easier time staying on task for longer. 

Anyone else have this experience? I'm thinking I've got to switch out my stuff at home too now.  I painted my walls in a broken white with the slightest hint of blue in it. Easy on the eyes. I was getting tired of all the noise. I wish I could lose more stuff. 

I might be moving sometime soon, get a bigger place. I know one room will be a meditation room, without any visual noise. 

Less junk for the mind to get grabbed by. When I lived at home my mother was one of these people that insisted on buying these irritating nick knacks to put on the cupboards and shelves and what not. It was alike an organized chaos. 

White rooms and decluttering. Very good.
 Yes, same! Every time I visit my family, I don't know how they can deal with all the noise! I've been slowly donating everything I don't absolutely love because I don't need all that in my life, it makes me feel like everything is caving in on me.
