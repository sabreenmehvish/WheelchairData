Strattera side effects question Is orange urine normal?  Also, there's some burning when I ejaculate, but it doesn't harm my wife. 

According to some websites, these are unusual/dangerous side effects. 

Anyone else have these problems? Orange color could be an indication of blood in the urine. 

Or your pH is too acidic and you're been taking vitamins?

Sounds moreeee like a UTI but you should consult with your doctor immediately. Blood in the urine is baaad. Common side effect regarding the burning sensation. Goes away for some people, doesn't for others. I'm also intermittent fasting, so I only eat once per day, or once every other day. The urine color changed when I started strattera, and it doesn't hurt to pee. Maybe my eating habits have something to do with it.  I'll make an appointment with my doctor just in case. Would definitely suggest that if you feel something is not right. It is a likely side effect from the medication.

Another concern: Make sure you're staying properly hydrated (add a pinch of sea salt to your drinks because your dietary sodium will likely be too low and you need sodium to maintain proper hydration). Even more important with a diet plan like that.
