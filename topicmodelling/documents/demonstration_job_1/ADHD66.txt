Energy Management Method Hi ADHD-ers

I thought I'd share a method I recently concocted to help outline my entire day more effectively.
Thought a novel concept can help keep our attention at least for a week.

The adage "Manage energy, not time" is even more appropriate for ADHD-ers, where mental energy needs to be more carefully managed. I work as a programmer, and if I misprioritize, my entire week can get thrown off.

I took my circadian rhythm, split equally in 7 blocks of time, giving me 7 energy buckets, which I associate with a specific tasks.

    6:45 - 9:10 :: Violet

    9:10 - 11:35 :: Indigo

    11:35 - 2:00 :: Blue

    2:00 - 4:25 :: Green

    4:25 - 6:50 :: Yellow

    6:50 - 9:15 :: Orange

    9:15 - 11:40 :: Red

Each block is 2:25 ~ 1/7th of a 17-hour day. (Assuming 7-hours of sleep)

**Violet**: My focus is conserving energy and building momentum; by minimize decisions between wake and work for maximum effectiveness.

**Indigo**: Peak hours, and key momentum point.

**Blue**: Plan for the afternoon trough, to eat lunch and perform lower effort tasks

**Green**: Anticipate energy recovery, and plan my exit task, something for me to finish tomorrow and help feed momentum.

**Yellow**: I ride out post-work momentum with prioritized housework/errands + key personal projects. Planned Power-nap/meditation to boost Yellow/Orange energy.

**Orange**: accepted as downtime, for leisure activities and reflection. Or non-mental tasks that can be done automatically

**Red**: Wind down routine, prepare wardrobe for next day. Think sleepy thoughts.



Having a color associated also helps visualize in what state I'll be when it comes around, so I don't over-task myself. My work day is usually in conjunction with "Three Most Important" Task completion, so I assign one key task, from most taxing to least taxing, one per color.

If you're a night owl I'd anticipate you could flip the color spectrum effectively.

My hypothesis is the time blocks aren't perfectly sized/allocated, but don't have enough data to make adjustments.

Let me know what you think, if you have any suggestions/improvements/tools. I have several other productivity structures I cycle through to help keep my edge, which I can share if anyone's interested. I don't think that would work for me, but I'm happy you've found something that works for you. That's awesome!

I prefer to just do things in blocks of 55 minutes and take 5 minute breaks between them. Basically, I take things one step at a time without a set plan or set schedule. Schedules/plans just stress me out, especially when things aren't going as I would expect them to. 

But an example:

9am-11am -- 2 breaks. "Do something that you *know* you can accomplish so that you're motivated to continue working throughout the day." Hmm, seems a bit too complicated for me. But it would be useful perhaps in a different form.

I often forget where my energy is at and how I’m prioritizing spending it. I could carry around a card telling me what color I’m at and how I should use/reserve my energy. Or something like that. I like this, loosely structured time blocking.

My goal with this method was to template my day, not schedule it all out. Since I usually think of thinks in how much mental energy X will take me, this prevents my optimistic "I'm going to study programming language X for 3 hours tonight" yellow or green is the best time to do that instead of orange or red.

I also value "violet" time, instead of squandering it on web comics and lesiurely eaten breakfast. If I can do something in red time, that saves violet energy.

Just a perspective lens, I just set them as gCalendar events for those time periods. Then as I check my schedule, I can quickly reference what color that'd be, categorize then
