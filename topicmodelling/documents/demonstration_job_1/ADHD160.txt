Bullet journals how do I keep going? I’ve seen many people on here talk about how great keeping a bullet journal is, but I can’t seem to make mine stick. I’ve tried at least five times. I love the concept, but how do I get myself to actually use it?! I’ve tried different types and different pens and markers and layouts but I can’t seem to use it for more than a couple days then it goes in a drawer never to be seen again. Until I get the “I’m gonna get super organized” bug up my ass and then I buy new stuff and start over. Any advice? Thanks!!  What i found for myself is that if I keep it as simple as possible it is easier to keep up. If I don't need to make it look pretty or fancy then it's a lot less hassle to just write what I need to do. 

I've also found that I tend to cycle through systems, using one for a while, to not using anything, to using another, to nothing, to the first again and so on. Maybe that's something I can work on, but maybe it's something I'll have to work with.

I guess what could help is asking yourself if you're making it more complicated than it needs to be with how it's set up, and if you can simplify it. You really want to know what the best planner is? 

It's the one you use.  

Whether that's shouting appointments into Google calender's voice interface,  a tiny pocket notepad,  a fancy day planner,  or sticky notes.  Whatever. Find one you use and then build on it. 

Habits take time to build and a lot of that is growing those mental bookmarks that remind you to use your tools.   **Simple advice:** Start with very basic notebook and one pen. Don’t worry about colors or drawings. Don’t look at what other people are doing. Make a decision about what you want the journal to help you with and then make a mock up with the features you want and maybe some test layouts. Once you get a workable system, set a couple reminders on your phone to check in with the journal two or three times per day. Once you start doing it at the same time everyday for a while, it will be more of a habit. Make sure the reminders are set at times that you are typically stationary, as in not driving. Leave it out on your desk while you work and take it with you everywhere. 

**Here is what I did to make it routine:**
I went slow and set a reward for myself to work towards. Started with a regular structured 2017 planner that I had abandoned earlier in the year. At first I just made lists and practiced using symbols and migrating tasks. I did that for the last few months of 2017 and decided if used regularly, I could treat myself to some new notebooks and fun stuff to start out 2018.  Made myself a travelers notebook system with three different notebooks- they are similar to moleskine cahier size so they are small and thin and easy to carry. I knew I wouldn’t bother to carry around a heavier hardbound book. It had to fit in my regular purse so I could always have it with me. At the beginning of the year I just carried two of the books and set another reward, that if used them regularly for January, I could buy myself a nice travelers notebook cover. 

I’ve been used it very consistently all year. Not perfectly but better than any other planner or app. I keep my layouts simple. I only use a ruler on my monthly habit tracker and that only takes me 10 minutes to set up. I don’t worry about drawings. I use just one colored marker per month to fill in the tracker and make highlights. I also have some washi tape that I use sparingly but do indulge in a lot of stickers. These last few things make it really fun and rewarding for me. I literally give myself a sparkly star sticker in the journal when I’m on time to work. I get a little addicted to marking off tasks. 
EDIT: Spelling  I'm so frustrated with the bullet journal subreddits that simply show artwork, or unused layouts and what not.

You know what I've started with?  A lined notebook.  And forget all that fancy drawing stuff, it gets in the way.  I have the index, the future plan, then start with one page for a montly overview, then start dailies as needed.  

Mine is more a "To Do" listing, with symbols.  

Bullet Points for To Do's.  Trash, Dishes, Grocery Shopping.  D&D Prep.

Exclamation Point: Important Things that need done That Day.  Pay Rent.  Bills. Call Doctors.

Heart: Memories.  Son lost a tooth.  Singing 80's songs with my wife in the car.  Went to the zoo.  Went to the beach.

D: Diary Entry.  Quick, short burst of important feelings for events. "Was really moved hearing the Star Wars theme played live by the orchestra today.  Brought me to tears."  "Frustrated that my friend didn't touch base with me after I said something was up, I should talk to them about that today."

How do I keep it going?  I check in with it every morning.  Write down my To Dos or whatnot, and see what I did or didn't do from the day before.

All that other stuff?  Distraction.  I mean, hey, if doodles help, by all means, doodle away, but I need some focus to keep my brain's blinders onto these tasks, the imagination my head can do on it's own, thank\-you\-very\-much. ;\) It's not working for everyone. You need to find whats working for you.  As above, I found I do best when I keep it as simple as possible.  It’s definitely not instagram worthy, but it works for me and that’s what counts. 

The other thing that helped for me was setting aside time for it. Just like any other habit, you need to actively work at it for the first little while. 

For me, this mean setting an alarm on my phone to remind me to check in with my bullet journal. 
I sit down for 10-15 minutes, make sure I did all of the things I meant to do today and think about the things I have to do in the coming days. 

Sunday night, I sit down for a little longer to plan out my week and see where my priorities are going to lie. 

It took a lot of heavy reliance on my alarm reminders to do this initially but now it’s part of my daily routine, and I don’t feel my day is complete until I’ve done it.  I don’t use mine as a planner at all. I use it as a doodle book to visually document the best days I have. Like a whole page will be the components of my chipotle order neatly spaced apart with different fonts for each item. I got rid of the stress of dates and times that would remind me that I forgot a day and instead made an amazing visual diary of one of my better years. It was a place that I made to fill with really good memories no matter how small ( what’s in my purse page, a doodle of tickets for every performance I saw that year, an entire page of writing my favorite words to write in cursive, doodle collages of my favorite shows like tattoo flash sheets ) I found  that my bullet journal wasn’t about remembering what was coming rather it was for remembering wonderful moments from the past. It made room for me to be more present and aware of my surroundings because I’d want to remember them to doodle them in my book!  The only way I’ve been able to keep up with it is to take off the pressure I felt to keep doing it! Now it’s ok if I miss a day or even a couple of weeks, I just step back into it when I’m feeling ready. This method has seen me keeping the habit more and more each time :)
I also keep all my trackers/etc on the one page now so I’m not filling in multiple graphs etc. Just one half page per day which includes sleep/medication/to do list etc! MAKE IT UGLY!!!scribble some poo down for today, and then check it if you remember to.

and then scribble some poo down again the next time you remember. 

It's way easier if you don't get wrapped up in it being organized or nice or pretty or effective or anything except having it on you, and trying to remember to look at it, so you don't forget it exists. I prefer a minimalist page. Three things to do at the top, emails, phone calls and "other" at the bottom.  Ok, this turned out a bit longer than I thought, but for me it's the combination of all these things that makes it work and I'm hoping it has one that will also work for you. 

-I use a ringbinder (A5), it's big enough so I can easily find it when I forgot where I put it, and it doesn't make me buy new stuff to start over with. I can just add new pages and get rid of the old ones.

-A different mindset can also help. Like when I started, my aim wasn't to get it perfect, my aim was to discover how many 'breaks' I took and when, just to see if I could spot a pattern. So if I missed a few days, it didn't feel like failing (that much) it was just more data gathered (I know this seems to conflict with the first thing, but I keep the older pages for the year in a box, so the binder itself feels pristine, but I still have the old stuff). 

-Make it as easy as possible for yourself. I still can't really think well first thing in the morning, so I have a template for all the stuff I want to do on a daily basis and once a week, I write it down for each day the following week and add appointments. You could even just make the list once and just print it 365 times, but for me the writing it down again and again helps me to remember it better. So when I get out of bed it's already there and I don't have to wait until I'm awake enough to think. 

-I use a lot of 'filler tasks', it might stress some people out because it makes the to-do list longer, but for me adding stuff like, take meds, make bed, clean kitty litter works like a charm, doing them all takes 2 minutes, but it does mean there are already 3 things crossed off before I had coffee and that makes me feel GOOD about myself. 

-I add fun things I want to do because it makes the list look better, if it's just a list of boring chores I can feel like my life is depressing when I look at it, but when I have things like watch episode 3 and 4 of X, do yoga and drinks with friends on the list as well, I'm automatically reminded that it isn't all that bad.

-I add the things I did without writing them down first. I'm still not the best with staying on task, it can be as simple as planning to do the laundry and also cleaning the trashcan (near the washing machine) because I noticed it was needed. When I don't add those spontaneous tasks it can look like I did 3 things that day which can make me feel like shit, but with the things I did when sidetracked on there as well it looks a lot better.   Ok yea! That way I don’t have have to remember where everything is, if I put it all on the same page. Good idea  Wow you really seem to have it down! I’ve considered a ring binder, but I’ve never tried it. Can you find dotted pages for it or do you just use blank ones? I have terrible handwriting and like keeping things neat (obviously ) so graph or dotted paper helps me with that. I like the idea of making a “master” list of things you do everyday and copying that once a week. Right now I just try to remember all that shit in my head and it doesn’t work well. Thanks so much for these ideas!  >What i found for myself is that if I keep it as simple as possible it is easier to keep up.

I think that is a good plan. I haven't yet mastered bullet journaling. 

My plan is to first make a journal where I write down my daily ToDo lists. Looking at it now, my last entry was 8 days ago. So I don't think I'm ready for trying to build a habit out of something more complicated.  This is great! I’ve been drawn to the travelers notebook style, I think I’m gonna try to take off the pressure and just focus on getting things written down. I love the idea of setting alarms too. Thank you!  I couldn’t agree more! I’m by no means an artist and never tried to use mine as such. I mean it’s beautiful but I’m looking for functional. I never thought of using it to keep memories till a couple of you have mentioned that. I love that idea! As a mom of three I would love to be able to have those things accessible to look back on. I like your key too. Thanks for the tips!  Thanks!!  That’s a cool idea!  Yes I’m definitely thinking to do lists but I’d also like to have my bills and a couple habits. Lol I guess I should put bujo as one of them! ;) One of the upsides to bulletjournaling to me is also that if I don't do it for a while, I don't have to guiltily skip weeks worth of pages like I'd have to with a calender :p Yep! You get it :) The thing I love most about it is that it is so flexible. I don't feel guilty if I have missed a few days. Also, if put in something I don't like, I can cover it up or tear out the page. I'm not too precious with it and just try to think of it as a tool. Once you let go of notions how it "should" look, it is easier to get going. And I agree with idonthaveusername27 - its gotta work for you.
