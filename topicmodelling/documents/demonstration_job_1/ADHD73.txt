I never realized how many systems I have put in place to help manage! I have always felt so lazy, and I hated people calling me lazy (my brother mostly) because I swear I wanted to do whatever it was, but it was just so much effort! 
But now, I have realized how many systems I have put in place to help with it. I realized one day that I wouldn't wear certain shoes because they were lace up, so I bought slip on laces and wear all the shoes. I am terrible at remembering to drink water so I bought a straw-sippy bottle, and now I don't have to unscrew and re screw the lid on every time I want to drink water, man I have to pee a lot though. Lastly, I taught myself a different keyboard layout (Colemak, hyperfocused) and now I can type 70 words a minute, so I can actually get thoughts out before I forget them! I just thought it was interesting that I put these systems in place that I don't even think about, but have made my ADHD slightly more manageable. What are some of your ADHD hacks? As someone who was only diagnosed recently, at the age of 32, it's been absolutely mind-blowing sorting back through my life and seeing just how many ways I have adjusted and adapted to make my life more manageable, without ever understanding why I needed those adaptations. 

Things like:

* being absolutely religious about list-keeping, 
* putting everything into my calendar immediately so that I can't forget
* relying heavily on routine to keep myself sane
* avoiding phone calls in favour of emails because I fear being caught off-guard and being unable to answer something immediately that I know I have the answer for I just need time to find it
* following up unavoidable phone calls with summary emails based off the obsessive note-taking I do throughout the call to keep myself focused

There are plenty of ways that I have struggled to adapt, though, which cause a lot of difficulties in both my work and my personal life. Having this diagnosis has been very helpful in coming to terms with my weaknesses so I can hopefully figure out ways to work around them. I have huge issues with getting started on tasks, and in my social life one of my biggest frustrations is that I have no patience for when things are out of control... so, even though I enjoy people a lot, I hate trying to do anything in a large group that involves having to wrangle people in any way... which is super frustrating because both mine and my fiance's social groups tend to do everything in big groups.  Omg the water bottle thing is so real! If there’s not a straw I just won’t drink water. I use a paper planner (for my personal planning) and a big wall calendar (for managing the family/ meal planning etc) everyday. Also, I found flylady years ago which keeps my house pretty tidy and keeps me focused on cleaning one thing at a time. I use a timer for tasks to help keep me focused and motivated. I have alarms set on my phone to remind me to take meds and to complete time sensitive tasks at work and home. What is the advantage of Colemak  [removed] Haha right! I would bring water and have like one sip and then forget to drink it for the rest of the day!  So the basic qwerty keyboard was designed for typewriters so that they wouldn't jam, by putting a commonly used letter next to one that isn't used as much (hence J being in a prime spot for your fingers). Colemak is designed to put the most used letters in the prime locations so you don't move your hands as much and can therefore type faster. It puts ARSTDHNEIO on the main line. It also has the advantage of forcing you to learn touch typing as I you can't look down at the keys! It took me a couple months to learn, but I love how fast I can type now, and I find that I don't have to think about the placement of letters on the keyboard, it's all muscle memory.   Oh wow! There really is a sub for everything isn't there??

Thanks dude!
