Any tips on falling asleep? Hey all, I'm having one those nights. One that [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9evyhv/i_wish_i_could_sleep_so_bad_it_makes_me_want_to/) does a **perfect** job describing. And I was hoping some of y'all might have some wisdom to share on how to quiet the beast and finally rock to sleep?


I do also have some tips and tricks I've discovered myself over the years of trail and error:


* I find listening to **new** instrumental music works for some reason. I found songs with too many words lead to too much word association. And music I know too well will just have me singing along in my head. Some people say they like movie soundtracks, but I find stuff thats too epic and cinematic makes me actively imagine too much and I'll end up finishing the album before the movie in my head is done. So I like music thats off rhythm or has a "weird" factor to it will keep my ADHD occupied just enough for the rest of me to sneak off to dream land. [Here's the playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crazzedshinobi/playlist/0ZVP5tQQuZ5x2i6Ddlpncu?si=w0VHyYiwS8-HKrZOqNXzDw) I use if anyone thinks it will help.


* Leaving the lights on really dim. I fortunately have lights I can control the color and intensity of, and I found having them at a **very** low and preferably orange tone kept my vision just barely active which helped give my  brain some information to process. For some reason engaging one of my senses just slightly helps curb all the racing thoughts


Its kind of like I have 2 minds working at the same time. While one is focused on sleeping the other has to keep itself occupied. Do you guys do anything to help fall asleep? aye, a fellow non-sleeper I see Graveyard shift FTW! But seriously I take a sleep aid every morning before bed to help shut my brain up. sweet, what kind? I take melatonin sometimes but it doesn't really work. I take a half dose of z-quil with pretty good results.  Full dise makes me feel tired when I wake up.  I also used to do well with simply sleep, just a single pill instead of the 2 for a full dose.
