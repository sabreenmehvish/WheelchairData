Any student nurses with ADHD? wanna help a sister out? Joked around that I had ADHD every time someone would make a comment about my forgetfulness and lack of focus. My tutor failed me on clinical placement because of it - taking this shit seriously now. 

I thought everyone was like me. Apparently not. 

Seeing the psychiatrist in a few days. Not sure what they can do to help me. 

I was in a general medicine ward. Somehow managed to do everything but nothing at the same time. 

On my way to collect someone's MSU, I would suddenly have an epiphany about something I was thinking of weeks ago. Then I would forget what I was doing and wander around the ward doing anything that wasn't what I was supposed to do. You guys can do the math and see how this is UNSAFE. 

Any help is much appreciated.   Tell the doctor what is going on and the struggles you are having in daily life and your schooling. I was referred to see a psychiatrist as an addiction counselor. I couldn't get my work done in a timely manner and didn't focus at staff meetings. Medication helped.  Not a student anymore but yes see a doctor!  I'm not on meds at the moment but they helped me tremendously at work.  I'm exactly in the same situation: ADHD-PI nursing student who just failed clinical placement. But in my case I have already been diagnosed and treated.

Here in Spain nursing is a 4 year degree. For the first 3 years we are treated like young students and I had no relevant problems, but in the last year nurses see us like almost-nurses so they expect us to be aware of everything at everymoment. Thats when I failed one placement. I wasn't on meds for that period, but it was also specially hard for everyone.

Which country do you live in? What kind of tasks are you expected to do?

In my case the solution was to sleep enough, take my meds and take notes on my notebook like a maniac. I wasted 4 notebooks in the last 6 weeks. I used [postit bookmarks](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dfNMziZRL._SL500_AA280_.jpg) for sections and a [4 color pen](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00EvCQzSYJhVbW/Multi-Color-Pen-0053-.jpg). Every color had a meaning, so I could write all the information as fast as posible.

Edit: Formating. Thanks! Thanks.  Any tips on coping or which area of nursing complements our disposition?  Thanks for your tips. I'll try them. 

I'm in New Zealand. The degree is 3 years over here. I'm in my first semester of 2nd year. 

They require a lot, in my opinion. There were very few things we couldn't do like insert a catheter or insert an IV luer.  We had to be supervised when getting and administrating meds. But we were expected to receive admission and discharge patients and make referrals to other services. 

It's not difficult to do. It's just difficult to remember to do and to do it right. 

I'll walk into a room to do one thing and come out with 50 more things to do. And most likely, I have forgotten why I had gone into the room in the first place. 

The feedback is that I don't care cause they think if it was important - I wouldn't forget. This paints me as uncaring and deliberately unsafe and malicious. 

Soo basically just how everyone else in my life sees me.  I always worked in ER/trauma which suited me beautifully! Anything fast paced and ever changing is ideal for me,  in the ER you go through so many different scenarios you'll never get bored. Perfect for a short attention span. Floor nursing just always seemed boring to me but I respect the nurses who can do it because I never did. The icu is cool too, anything critical! 
I can even see the appeal in urgent care because it's fast paced but less stressful.  
Nursing in general can be exciting so definitely be open, especially as a new grad, but I personally thrived working in the ER. Don't worry, is really difficult for us at first, but you can improve a lot, and also, not all nursing jobs require the same amount of atention.

A good use of notebook will be your best weapon.  
I use 5 bookmarks:

* **Red for the patients list**: bed, patology, allergy and any other important info.

* **Blue for things I have to learn**, like a specific disease, a drug or something about discharge managing.

* **Yellow for any fast thing**, like anything a patient ask or anything I have to bring 
from the medication room. This is for things which don't require to be remembered for more than 20min. I cross out things as I finish them.

* **Dotted yellow for things I have done**, like give the medication to Mr. Doe or take care of Mrs. Simpson wounds. It's not the first time they ask me "Did you give the medication to Mr. Doe?" and I don't remember.

* And finally, **Green bookmark for any idea** not related to nursing, so I can throw them there and focus in the actual work.

Obviusly, the most I use is the yellow one, I'm always writing and checking it. You would notice once you start taking lot of notes with important info your mind is more free, so you will remember other little things.

Once you have more experience you would begin to control things better, maybe you will need a few years of experience to be the excellent nurse you're going to be, but I think that in a few months you would be good enought for your supervisors.

Also at first you can feel really lost, and that can made patients to have a bad opinion about you. But don't worry, patients are easy. Once you control the basics you can look really confident, and if you are kind enought they will 
apreciate you as a great nurse.

And like everybody here says, go to see a Doctor, medication can help a lot.

Edit: formating. Thank you so much. This is really helpful. :)
