How do you organize your life by colors? I just got a planner to kick start my year and I need a great coloring system. So I was curious, how do you guys color coordinate your life? I have enough problems just using a dayplanner on a regular basis. 

However, for the customizable tabs on my Google mail & Calendar, I use a simple combination:

* RED = important or urgent

* GREEN = work stuff, or stuff I need to do on a regular basis

* YELLOW = optional or unnecessary

And, then for folders in my inbox for preferred or favorite projects or people I work with, 'favorite colors' like Purple or Blue. Sometimes for stuff I hate and don't have to do ...but need to archive... Brown. 

For the day-planner, when I do manage to use it, I usually stick to a dark soft 2B graphite woodcase pencil. However, I have 2-in-1 blue & red pencil (points on both ends) that I sometimes use. 

I've seen 'rainbow' multi-color coding systems but I know once I misplace or forget the corresponding pens/highlighters, my discipline will fall to pieces.  Colorblind :( Just because your blue isn't my blue has nothing to do with your organization method.  True. But it's probably one reason why I've never tried color coordination as an organizational method. The larger point is that I should have an organizational method. Flying by the seat of your pants is exciting and all, but the nagging fear of forgetting something at work is definitely overrated. I understand that. Finding the happy medium is tough. That's why I made this post.
