What's your favorite calendar/ self-organizing tool? Which tool have you found that worked the best for you? 

I haven't found a method that's stuck yet but I'm determined to find one that works.

Ironic how ADHD makes using tools to help improve ADHD harder ...

&#x200B; I can tell you what *doesn't* work for me: a bullet journal. It is the exact opposite of the sort of planner I need. Bullet journals work great if you can sit down and focus on something, take your time, have the patience and attention span to do it the way you want. I've started two now and they devolve into chicken scratch, then end completely, within about 6 pages.

What does work for me is Google Calendar, and my work (happens to be Outlook/Exchange) calendar, and a phone that integrates the two into one calendar. The IOS default calendar app does this pretty well. Ways it is better than a bullet journal: the infrastructure has already been created, unlike a bullet journal; it will nag me to do things, unlike a bullet journal; and it fits in my pocket... you get the idea.

 I add *everything* I need to do to my personal calendar. I also have a shared calendar with everyone else in my family that they can add things to. These two calendars integrated with my work calendar effectively form a to-do list and day planner for me. If I know I'll be working on something for a few days, I treat it like a multi-day event. If I can bust it out in an hour, it takes up an hour on my daily view.

The other great thing about me and a phone calendar is I really am a monotasker- I think most ADHD people are. Even though we have a million things coming at us all the time, we can only do one thing really well at the same time. So the calendar helps me prioritize and set limits. I see a meeting on the calendar and think "set everything else aside and do this thing!" And that is exactly what I need to be told when I'm off in lala land.

So I haven't done this IN the calendar, because I think the sheer number of alerts would be maddening, but I do really well on a Pomodoro timer. So I use my calendar in conjunction with a Pomodoro app. Between those two simple things, I can get stuff done. Here's what works for me - it very well may not work for others!

For time sensitive things (appointments, meetings, etc.) I use google calendar.  But I hated the google calendar app so much (predictive text would throw me off SO MUCH I'd forget what I was putting in there) that I switched to using the **Simple Calendar app** (on Android)

**Bullet journal** for basically everything else.

However, in order for the bullet journal to actually work for me, I had to do a few things.  [I wrote a post about it a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9tbwa1/how_im_using_a_bullet_journal_to_help_with_my_adhd/), and I've occasionally posted in /r/bujo (the sub more focused on productivity than pretty spreads) if you look in my history but my bullet journal looks nothing like the pretty things on /r/bulletjournal.

I had previously always kept a list of things that I needed to do for school before bullet journals were a thing, and then they became a thing, I copied some things from them, and adjusted to what worked for me.

For example, despite trying it, a monthly calendar just never gets used in my journal, so I don't use it - I use a calendar on my phone instead. I am not sure how to link a picture, but I use a color coding system, as well as compartmentalizing the different tasks. For work, i divide up a white board into 8 categories. 5 of which deal with the various stages of organization needed for different parts of the warehouse. 2 are divided into tasks (my common duties) and assignments (one off tasks). the last is a Write In section that other people can write stuff in. 

the color coding system is a bit complicated. I have 10 different codes, some of which can be combined. They deal with what stage the project is in, is it a priority, and, if needed, are the necessary items being ordered or do they need to be. 

TL;DR I like to make color coded lists, divided into categories  I like Trello a lot for organizing. I have the free version with one power-up which I used to make recurring cards - they'll automatically pop up when they're coming due. I have inbox, which I can email to, ask Google to add an item to, or manually add an item. The other boards are now, today, this week, waiting, and someday/maybe. It's a less serial killer looking way of handling the post it note mess I used to do. Being able to see everything at once and move it around is super helpful for me. It also doesn't make me feel shameful when things are stuck that aren't my fault (waiting) but does keep them visible so I know to follow up. Taskade!! Week by week and you can set your long term goals. It’s useful but it’s important to update it. Once I got into the habit of setting it up, I was able to help keep myself organized and and get a visual reminder for when things were due or appointments. Morning routine is great as well as you can time your daily tasks and an alarm will ring so you can move on to the next. I for one would love to see your setup as a visual representation. My current system is garbage compared to what you're selling here. If you get some downtime, please share! That would be so methylphenidate! 

 This is my first Imgur post, so I apologize that it is two separate links. I hope you enjoy! Please tell me your thoughts, if you would like

Edit: I wish I took a picture of it a few weeks ago. My schedule has lightened up a smidge since then, but most of the sections had a line item in them Thank you! I really appreciate it. This is perfect and gave me a ton of ideas. I actually just ordered a huge whiteboard on Amazon a couple of days ago. About to hop back on and order a variety of colored pens. I love the color coding system. This is next-level. So stoked!
