Self-improvement? More like self-im-snooze-ment! Looking for self-help resources that are engaging! Forgive the pun and the length.

I'm searching for advice for my partner, who is 29(m) and self-Dxed. Due to insurance/finantial reasons, medical intervention isn't an option for us right now. He seems to be most impacted by his difficulties with emotional regulation, working memory, and inhibiting his behavior in social situations. Here's more detail on that in bullet points, or you can skip it:

* Emotional Regulation: When he has an intense emotion, even if it starts as tiny, he'll get stuck on it in his mind. If it's a negative emotion, he'll end up falling into this pit that's difficult to get him out of without finding a way to divert his attention. I see it interfering with his ability to go about his day, and also socially, as he's told me some people interpret this fixation (especially on negatives) as him being overly-passionate, and he's worried those people avoid sensitive topics around him because of this. Some people have described him as an "angry person", even though I don't see him that way when you dig more and spend time with him. 

* Working Memory: While I don't know a ton of adults with ADHD to compare his struggles in this area to, I'd say he's on the more extreme end in terms of how impacted he is. We use a lot of organizational systems and cues in our home, because we both have EF difficulties. They don't seem to be meeting all my partner's needs at the moment, though. He typically only eats two meals a day, not because he's not hungry or doesn't have time, but because he forgets. Meals are things that are a natural part of his routine/schedule, but he still forgets almost daily. More than twice a week he forgets lunch, tea, or his work bag at home, even though we have the same routine every weekday, and reminders in place to help. I cannot ask him to complete a task in another room without giving him something physical (a note, an empty water bottle, etc.) to remind him of the task, because he will forget what he left the room for a few seconds later, or occasionally, forget that I had asked something of him at all.

* Social Inhibition: I don't see this one as impactful on a daily basis for him, but I think it's the issue that affects him the most on an emotional level, so I included it. My partner loves socializing, but frequently talks about disliking that he gets over-eager in conversations, and either talks too long, too passionately (see emotional regulation), or says things that he knows afterwards were inappropriate for the context. (I don't really see this, but I have ASD, so I'm probably not picking up on it). It seems he worries he's losing potential social connections this way, as people see him as "too much" when they first meet him. 



I work in psychology, so I know a thing or two about where his EF struggles are coming from and some things that might be helpful for addressing them. But due to my own issues with communication, I'm not well equipped to share my knowledge with him. I've pretty much structure/scheduled the crap out of our home, and have helped him with some reminders and things on his phone, but its sort of getting to the point now where any further supports need to come from him internalizing some new knowledge or skills. 

Knowing his personality and traits, I think mindfulness would be hugely beneficial. Also just learning about what ADHD is in general, as he's not super informed (and I'm not good at explaining things verbally). The problem is, most methods for learning about different coping strategies or self-help techniques are text-based. My partner can't sit and read a book. He can barely keep himself focused on a ten minute Youtube video played at 1.5 speed. Meanwhile, I'm quite happy to read an information text for hours, so I'm not the best person to seek these things out for him. I think everything is interesting.  

This is why I need the help of others with... high standards?... for engagement. So I guess I'm looking for any suggestions of exciting resources that could teach my partner about ADHD, mindfulness, or any other self-help strategies that any of you have found useful. He has good auditory attention, so podcasts are fine. Audiobooks would only work if the text is especially humorous or entertaining, I think. He would definitely engage with something that was hands-on or included game-like activities (thing like a color/activity book for adults) although I'm not sure if such things exist. 

* Obligatory disclaimer: I don't want this list of his difficulties to make it seem like he's a total train wreck. He's actually very capable, intelligent, and accomplishes things that amaze me every day. And it's that fact that makes these difficulties so much harder to passively accept in his life, because I feel he's too awesome to be held back by these small EF annoyances. I greatly appreciate any and all input, as I don't often get the chance to talk to adults with ADHD. 



**TL/DR:** My partner wants to access more information and self-help related to ADHD, but has a low tolerance for passive/boring learning. Need executive dysfunction-friendly resources :) 
 ADHD rewired podcast Consider the following

- watch “HowToADHD” on YouTube. 
- Read “Taking Charge of Adult ADHD” by Dr Russell Barkley 
-  “Driven to Distraction” by Dr Ned Hallowell.

I find the following helpful:

- Never use willpower when routine can be developed; but be extra careful with new routines
- Lists
- Sleep
- Meditation
- Healthy diet
- Effective medication
- Mindfulness
- A secretary or organised partner if possible
- Background chill music or house music when you work. No lyrics, or at least foreign lyrics
- Bullet journal
- A launchpad, i.e. an area where things needed for leaving the house are kept
 I’m currently making an online course on how to conquer your fears, I was thinking about posting it here for free access when it’s done, but here’s the word doc if you want to check out my meta research for now. It has a lot of research from Harvard and other reputable sources you can’t read unless you have access. It’s mostly on emotional regulation which might serve you well

 Thank you! Thank you for your suggestions! We have actually watched the "how to ADHD" series. He liked it and found parts helpful, but it can be so general that it's difficult to implement the strategies she talks about. I have read the other two books, and found them informative, but I don't think he'd be engaged enough to read or listen to either, unfortunately. 

As for other suggestion, we already do pretty much all of those things on a daily basis, other than the medication, as I explained. I'm definitely doing the best I can as his "secretary" partner, but I also have some EF difficulties (I have ASD), so there's only so much I'm able to do. Do you have any resources you could share in regards to bullet journaling? My partner was interested in this when we learned about it through "howtoADHD", but couldn't get the hang of it with the methods she suggested. That's awesome, thank you! No real expertise here apart from my experience of how adaptable it is.
