Impulsivity and Recklessness are some of the most awful aspects of ADHD! I lose a lot of money simply by damaging phones and Tech in general, it's so easy to get distracted and get hyperfocused on this wonderful color of the desk you have rather than the fact that your phone is being smashed on the floor. 

Also buying things without any second thoughts is a huge drain of my wallet. 

Do you hate it as much as I do?  I've always had a thing for walking into the road with cars coming Impulsivity is horrible when hyperfocusing on the phone and buying two of every item.

Impulsivity is sometimes very good when I'm at work, feels like my reflexes are better, I'm more active and can easily help other co-workers while still having time to manage my own work.

I work with different carpenter, painting stuff. We move a lot of furniture and wood for crafting stuff, the boards can be very heavy and it requires that someone fast clears the table or moves stuff no one else thinks of doing.

Sometimes it makes me happy that I've accomplished a lot in a short amount of time.

Depends on the day and if my routine and meds are up to 100%. I hate it! Yeah me too I agree, thanks for taking your time to write it down ,:) Noooooo problem :)
