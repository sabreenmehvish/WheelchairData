Got diagnosed two days ago, feeling overwhelmed This has been a really wild week. I guess I'm writing this so I don't forget my feelings? And so I can discuss with my psychologist.

I never thought I would have ADHD, but as I read more and more about it, I just feel so...overwhelmed. The how-have-I-been-living-like-this-for-the-past-two-decades sort of overwhelmed. For starters, I don't really fit the stereotype -- I'm 20/F, have my B.S. in a top CS program, and am applying to grad school this cycle. An aside -- my psychologist told me that if you were (1) quiet and (2) well-mannered as a child, you would not raise any flags for ADHD. As a result, it's quite common for women to not get diagnosed when they are young.

Anyways, here are my symptoms that upon listing had me realize just wow...they all add up to something... To people that study CS, the feeling I have is like finally finding a bug (or having some notion of what the bug is), but damn I sure hope this is the bug.

* It is so hard for me to remember things. As a result, I can't remember the causes of my emotions (anger, sadness), unless someone tells me that X happened. This has terrible effects -- I will get into arguments about the same thing, I feel so emotionally detached sometimes (I have been able to walk away from relationships without feeling a lot).
* I get a really bad headaches when I experience intense emotions (especially after crying). It's really easy for my emotions to swing out of control.
* I context-switch a lot during conversations arguments. Zone-out for a few seconds and bam shit-wtf-is-going-on. Eyes always shift around the room. I wish I was better at making eye contact T_T
* It sort of feels like my entire life is passing me by and I'm just there looking at the current snapshot. I don't have a sense of self (what made me really sad was when my psych told me that one day I might even be able to have a favorite color...)
* I'm really disorganized. Haven't used my desk in months.
* I experience a lot of social anxiety. Starting a conversation, then getting too anxious to reply. ...I have >100 unread messages on Facebook... :(
* I have been procrastinating since elementary school. Am a damn professional by now.

Just this Tuesday, my GP diagnosed me with moderate-severe depression & anxiety, and handed me a script for Lexapro and a list of CBT therapists. I decided to get a second opinion before starting my medication, and went to see a psychologist on Thursday. My psychologist was about to conclude that I had a non-specific mood disorder, until I told her that I couldn't remember the causes of emotions very well. Then she described symptoms of ADHD and I burst out crying because of how similar they were to what I was experiencing. I'm going to see her again on Tuesday and unload all of this.

Tips for coping would be really appreciated!! Currently, my psychologist told me to write everything I do in one of those hourly appointment planners. I'm so anxious to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. I just want to be functional aaaahh!!! Yeah it's a trip. It's finding out the solution to a question that's been central to your experience, but that you've never even been able to formulate properly. And then now after 20 years, there's the picture of reality that finally makes sense.. okay..

It'll take some time to adjust to your new understanding, especially before you get treatment. Don't be afraid to research the hell out of everything.

I think you should take a look at the non-stimulant options like Guanfacine, or maybe even ssri's to help with emotional control. Stimulants alone don't seem to help much with this for me (though I'm not that anxious anymore).

(Repost from a comment I made to someone else:) I have found some useful truths for myself while I was undiagnosed and extremely anxious (though I've never been truly depressed). These might help in the mean time:

- Realize that you *own* your entire experience. Your emotions, your worries, your thoughts, they are all parts of what you control. This thought helps me a lot in recognizing when emotions aren't worth worrying about.

- Think back two weeks, and consider if what you were worrying about then is still relevant to worry about now. If it all wasn't, then you can spot some of the flaws in what feels like an ever present reality.

- Whatever happens because of your ADHD has an actual excuse. This doesn't mean that you can excuse everything that you do, but it does mean that you can also simply accept results of it as your problem, instead of your fault. (Found this later on Reddit but still useful)

- meditation is a great way of grounding yourself for when you feel anxious or trapped in your emotions. It can (hopefully) allow you to experience repreive for a short time.

To be honest, just understanding will probably help you a lot already. Now you can mentally properly label the reason for emotions or failures or whatever. The lack of a big giant question mark hovering above all your actions takes away a lot of personal anxiety, at least for me.

 I am in a similar situation where I have also just been diagnosed, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with Dysthymia and ADHD and then recommended i get checked for Autism which i did and came back autistic to top it all off. 

It honestly takes time to sort through your feelings and emotions, give yourself time for that. I am also trying to remember to be kinder to myself, now that i know i have these issues, i am not just dumb and lazy and a looser. I have genuine issues and I should be kinder to myself, after all i wouldn't speak to someone else that way. Thank you for your kind words <3 <3

It's been a whirlwind of a week.

I got put on adderall, and it's been pretty good so far -- but the CBT sessions I'm having with my psychologist have been phenomenal. It's definitely some kind of dark arts that she's performing to be able to shift my thoughts in a positive direction. Can confirm SSRIs are wonderful. 33 years old and depression/anxiety have been an unhealthy ADHD coping mechanism. I mean, you can get shit done on time if you're always stressed and everything is urgent.

Zoloft did unmask my ADHD a bit more. Like I stopped doing the dishes. Left the yard unmowed. Work suffered. Etc. Luckily there was only a 2 week gap. Started my stim last Monday. Another nice side effect is that food tastes better and I have a better sense of touch. I am currently undiagnosed (tested last Tuesday and get results in 19 hours).

My advice.... Do NOT research or study up after reading a couple of articles (or YouTube) because you will hope so strongly for a diagnosis that waiting is torture.  Get a psychiatrist to actually give you testing and see what happens.  Then research and read up on what the findings are. I am trying very hard to not dive into it because I am terrified they will say I am actually something else.  Be kind to yourself! <3

You're not dumb, lazy, or a loser. You're valid!!!

Also, I would recommend CBT -- it's been amazing for managing my negative, self-berating thoughts. Good luck! I might need to look into getting me some of that wizardry too.
