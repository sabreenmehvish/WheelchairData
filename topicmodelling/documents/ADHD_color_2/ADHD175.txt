Just a couple recent personal observations I wanted to share and get some feedback on, maybe even hear other people's personal observations. I've noticed as I've been getting closer to 30,  I'm not only enjoying, but APPRECIATING time I get to myself. I always seemed to want to be around people and stimuli, but recently it's been chill. Like currently, I'm sitting outside of a Wawa, just enjoying a few smokes, and a mixture of mostly my own thoughts and Reddit. And it just feels like my mind is just defragging all of the internal clutter.

Certain colors seem to pop more to me. Reds, blues and greens are the big ones.

I have lost interest in the main line instant gratification social medias. I only pop onto Facebook every couple of days to just see the memories feature.

And I just realized it's the 10 year mark for me being off medication for ADHD. Some struggles throughout the last decade without them, but I never felt right on them. Always felt like a hazy version of myself.
