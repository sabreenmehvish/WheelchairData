How is living in Seattle? Hey everyone! I am originally from the Boston, MA area living in Charlotte, NC now. I absolutely HATE Charlotte. I‚Äôm only here because my husband got a job here and I had to move *sigh*. I want a change. People here are not very friendly, and they don‚Äôt really know how to hold a conversation. Rent and cost of living are extremely high with salaries for recent college grads at $27,000 per year. Not much to do except breweries and get drunk / high. 

How have you guys liked Seattle so far? Any info or input on the city, area, job market, cost of living with job salaries, atmosphere of the city, weather, etc. I have never been to the West Coast but I have read a lot of lovely things about Seattle and want to see what I can get from people on here! Also, if somebody can mention the overcast/rain aspect as that seems to be a huge drawback for my husband. 

Thanks so much!  If those are your complaints about Charlotte, then you'd *really* hate it here.

* Seattle and PNWers in general are very icy, unsocial people. We even have a name for it-the Seattle Freeze.

* The Job Market is good, but only if you're in the Tech Industry or a related field.

* The Cost of Living is astronomically high. Only San Francisco and Manhattan beat us. $2000+ a month is normal for a one bedroom apartment. There is a 1000 sq ft starter home down the street from my place in an out-of-the-way neighborhood that just sold for $900,000.

* The Greater Seattle Area has been growing immensely in the last ten years. As a result, the culture of the city is in turmoil. Seattle is no longer a laid back place.

* Homelessness is a massive problem here. You cannot walk most of downtown without seeing several dozen scattered heroin needles.

* Yes, it rains a lot here. Not so much in overall volume, but in number of rainy days. It is dark, cloudy, chilly, and drizzling from basically September through the end of May/June. 

* Breweries and getting drunk/high are basically universal activities here.

It can be a very nice place to live, but it is also expensive, stressful, and can be isolating and depressing to many outsider. Jesus Christ  My sister lives in Charlotte and she loves both Charlotte and Seattle because they're so similar! You will hate it here. Check out Denver and Texas. :) If the weather doesn't make you depressed, seeing all the homeless people will.  $27K/yr. for college grads.  Minimum $30K here for high school drop outs. I moved to Seattle from Charlotte. Cost of living here is WAY higher. My $1400 CLT- equivalent apt costs double here with parking.

 I will say there is a lot to do here and a lot more eclectic in terms of  the types of people you meet. CLT was pretty homogenous and I don't miss that aspect one bit. Though many (not all!) people from the PNW can be a little cold/awkward to talk to and become friends with, there are plenty of transplants here. Overall, I'm glad I moved here.  If you and your husband make a combined income over  about 150k, youre going to love Seattle. Less than that, its going to be a struggle. Stay where you are. Our winters can lead those to suicide who are unable to adapt. Only thing worse is Siberia.  3/10 Hi!

 

I‚Äôm a somewhat new Seattle transplant, so I thought I could chime in here! üòä My husband and I moved to Seattle from Chicago, over a year ago and we are in our 20‚Äôs, so I feel we are in similar positions. We have lived in a few different areas now, so I thought I‚Äôd share a few views on the points you mentioned.

 

**Rent prices**: Rent will be WAY higher than Charlotte,NC. However, if you get jobs in the Seattle market you will be better off. We are currently in a suburb of Seattle and pay more than we did in our downtown 2 bedroom apartment in Chicago with amazing city views. 2 bedrooms in the Seattle area (some suburbs included) are around 4k a month, at least.  
    
  
**Weather**: Coming from Chicago, we weren‚Äôt too focused on the bad weather since we weren‚Äôt particularly used to good weather. However, I almost think it is worse in a way. The rain doesn‚Äôt bother me so much as the constant grey skies. You can definitely go a whole week, or maybe even months in the winter without seeing the sun. With that being said, I‚Äôve only experienced one true winter here so my judgement might not be the best. We have been getting a lot of sun lately and when it is sunny, the beauty of the area is unmatched! The rainy season didn‚Äôt seem to start until late October last year and lasted until the summer began. While the weather isn‚Äôt fantastic, I will say it‚Äôs very mild. You get four seasons, but don‚Äôt have to deal with freezing temps/ a ton of snow. It also won't ever get unbearably hot
  
  
**People**: This one is tough! Coming from the Midwest, I think it is maybe hard to have realistic expectations, since the people there are generally known to be kind. The people were A LOT friendlier and outgoing in Chicago than here. My first week here in the city, I had a man spit on my face and tell me I was a ‚Äústupid B*tch‚Äù, for literally no reason other than he probably thought I looked like a dumb blonde. For a city that prides itself on diversity, it seems the people here can be quite judgmental and maybe even a little pretentious. If anything, the people here aren‚Äôt rude, they are just more passive in nature. I think it takes way more effort to make friends here than it would anywhere else. I also think they don‚Äôt go out of their way to be warm and friendly to strangers. We have met some really nice people though and I think it‚Äôs unfair to say everyone here is rude and standoffish. I just have never thought about the people in a city until I moved here and I really do believe in the ‚ÄúSeattle Freeze‚Äù now.
   

  
I feel like I probably harped a lot on Seattle, but with all the negatives, this place truly is BEAUTIFUL. You can drive to so many cool places nearby, like Oregon and Canada. Hiking is at your fingertips, and it is a great place to be if being outdoors is your thing. I would also suggest you look into Denver, as I know their rent is way cheaper than here and you can get some of the same perks. We have several friends who live there and absolutely love it. Also, if you've never been to the West Coast definitely go check out California, as there are a lot of cool places there with great weather!
  
 

Feel free to ask me any questions! Moving is great and it shows you what you value in a place. Seattle is a great city, but sadly I think it is not for everyone..but it might be for you! My new theory on why people complain about the Seattle Freeze these days despite there being an *incredible* number of transplants is that it's just a bunch of new college grads expecting to be able to make friends like they are a Freshman in college. Making new friends as an adult is hard regardless of where you are.  Hey, a New Englander! I'm from CT myself, so maybe you'll see where I'm coming from.

Been in Seattle a few years now. It's fun, there's cool activities, but honestly...you have to put in a lot of work to find people here. It's doable, a d I've had some fun, but people really aren't as open to hanging out as they are in the Northeast. Or you'll go to a meetup or something, but they won't want to hang after, or they disappear but then sometimes reappear...

Honestly, it's frustrating. There's a lot to love about this place, but you gotta be real good with the idea that it may take quite a while to find friends, and if unfriendly people are your biggest complaint, this really isn't the place to go.

I hope that helps somewhat. Always down to answer questions if you have any. Good luck with everything. https://vimeo.com/42318824 give this a listen.  People whining about some "Seattle freeze" are like fleas who get butthurt because the dog didn't throw them a welcome party.  We need to use you're response in an add to get people to stop moving here. Thank you for the input! Very helpful :) The biggest shift is the weather climate, many newcomers are driven to tears and/or depression.  To elaborate on the accurate "rains a lot here point," technically New York City gets more rain annually than Seattle.  The difference being is that in NYC, it can come in short bursts in the form of big thunderstorms.  Here in Seattle, thunderstorms are somewhere between seldom and rare, and the precipitation falls in a constant drip from November to about April. ? If you are not finding people in Charlotte to be friendly, you will be  *very* disappointed, if you expect Seattle to be an improvement.

Ditto for cost of living.
Housing in Seattle is at least double the cost of Charlotte.

 Thank you! :)  Thank you so much! I am looking into Denver as well, but definitely feel as though Seattle‚Äôs beauty is unmatched between the two. California is so expensive I don‚Äôt know how anyone can do it sadly. Your answer has been super helpful. :) Thanks again!!!  Haha that was funny, yet helpful. Thanks!  It's accurate and not unfair. I like it.  I think it's because this sub gets SO many questions like this. And there's a sidebar over to the right with the largest type reading "Moving here or visiting?" so of course people get irate when people post that they're moving here, or visiting, and can someone tell them what that's like and where they should go. :)

That said, well...I love Seattle but lately it's getting on my nerves. We have a huge population of mentally ill and/or drug-addicted folks living on the streets and in the greenbelts. The traffic gets worse every year, and the buses seem less reliable. But there's still the gorgeous, green summers, and all the great outdoor things to do, and great shopping and amazing restaurants and art and theater. 

There's rain, yes, and long, long, dark winters. Come visit. Come in January. If you still think you want to live here...welcome!  We have growing pains.  More folk have moved to the area than the social climate is comfortable handling (particularly with regard to transit and housing infrastructures).

New folk are bound to receive a cold welcome from a moderate portion of this particular internet forum, as this is where we come to complain.

For similar reasons, it can also be surmised that Seattle is a highly desirable place to live, in spite of very high cost of living and municipal frustrations.  

To answer your questions: 
It does not rain nearly so much as you've heard.  It is merely overcast and damp most of the days between October and April; temperatures do not typically drop below freezing, or rise above mid-80s.  It is eye-wateringly beautiful weather from May to September.  

Job market highly depends on your industry/sector, but can be generalized as 'booming' within the Seattle area.  Salaries are moderately high, presuming you come for the right positions (tech/aero/software/medical should have starting salaries well above $50k, possibly even into six-figure territory).  Salaries for working class (servers, hairdressers, baristas, etc) are high, but still a bit shy of being a living wage ($15 min wage is not enough to 'get by' in a happy carefree fashion here).

Socializing is typified by the "Seattle Freeze", implying that residents are cold and dismissively polite to outsiders, but it's more that it's a clique-ish culture, and folk tend to remain within their friend circles; once you make A friend, an have a foot in the door, it's quite easy to make more.

Cost of living is high.  Average 2bdr/2ba rental in a mid-tier neighborhood is going to run you 2500/mo give or take.  Average 1bd might be in the 1800-2000 range.  Sales tax is high, but not unbearable.  Gas prices are average, car registration and parking fees are pricey.  Airfare to/from seattle is comparatively pricey. Of course! Yes, Denver doesn't really compare in terms of overall beauty! In terms of rent costs, southern CA is noticeably a lot cheaper than this area, but perhaps not what you are looking for. Good luck on finding "the place"! :) There are a lot of them and they are all funny. My favorite is this one https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IfCx_11dVq8.
