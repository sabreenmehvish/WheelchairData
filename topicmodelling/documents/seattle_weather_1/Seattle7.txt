Both of Seattle’s seasons in one shot.  [deleted] know this location well, excellent shot! I’m from the Midwest moved to a seattle 15 years ago. I’ve heard thunder like 6 times while here-no real Thunderstorms here. Did have snow for like 3 weeks once, maybe in 2007. Like 2 inches. City closed for the duration The weather today has been great. I missed the storms. Fuck summer.  Nice pic.    We do have 4 seasons here though. This image does not capture Seattle’s two true seasons, Winter and Construction.  Hey!  Seattle has three seasons.  Winter, Summer, and May. Summer is way too short.  Love this spot! Right by Echo, right? I'm fine with this.

 #RejectNewSeasons. Those pictures could have been taken in the same day here every time i think of the time i was gang raped in north carolina..glad im in seattle now. Instead we’ll have construction *always*! :P [deleted] Welcome to depression and traffic construction always for ever now. 

Good luck seeing the cyclists and pedestrians jump out into darkness that swallows street lights plus rain. Elliott Bay where they do hempfest?  Yep, the blessings and curse of being extremely temperate. No one remembers how to deal with really inclement weather, or they're overconfident and end up sliding down the hills. I actually love fog but if I didn’t it would still be tons better than all the smoke we had during the summer  Correct. Fall / more intense fall / less intense fall / smokey. we deserve much less =) There is a street view on Google Maps close to that spot, it's not exactly, but very close:

r/https://goo.gl/zNvped This is one unedited photo And the other 8 is gridlock Bike has made this almost a non-issue. [deleted] [deleted] I love fall I always saw it:   thunderstorms, cold, rainy, hot/smokey
 [deleted] It's funny. My saying that summer is way too short is getting downvotes.  lol I was drunk when I first looked at this, thought it was two photos side by side of the same spot with one reversed. I was trying to joke about our bipolar weather. Are you gatekeeping traffic?  Haha, I saw an umbrella shop! 

Yea, see it’s evil genius, this red state guy who hates liberals moved up to Seattle to sell umbrellas because it rains. Unknowingly, the buyer of the umbrella opens it In cases of rain or forward winds, being pulled into traffic where their life is ended. 

It sometimes doesn’t work as one of the rear view mirrors of a bus will grab the umbrella or the person didn’t purchase the hooked umbrellas that do the pulling.  oh please, falls in Seattle are pathetic, we're no New England that's for sure. What thunderstorms? I've probably heard thunder a total of 2 times in the 2+ years I've lived here (and that's 2 booms, not 2 storms with multiple booms each) All that matters is, we live in an exceptionally beautiful region of the nation. I consider the 3/4 of the year that is grey and rainy a tax on the amazing landscape we have. You forget spiders. Spiders is a season here. We have very few thunderstorms - certainly not enough to name a season after them. I suppose we can call the 2 weeks of below freezing winter, and the 2 weeks above 90F summer. I'll give you spring though.  That's because r/Seattle thinks you have to love shitty weather to be a true Seattleite. Towards the end of October we hit thunderstorm season.   Some years it's mild, some years it's not. I like that perspective. Also, the cool and damp season makes the hot and dry season more enjoyable by contrast, and vice versa. I'm really loving the change in weather right now. Agreed. Winter temps 40-degreees above those I grew up in. AND I find I'm glad to be around so many people thriving in a northern rain forest. Excpetionally danerous, surrounded by active mega volcanos, subduction zones and general earthquakes/forest fires. Those are also some pretty major "taxes". Do you even live here? People call everything above 75 summer. [deleted] Shitty is subjective. [deleted] >makes the hot and dry season more enjoyable 

Not if the hot and dry season permanently becomes lung cancer season... Earthquakes. Tornados. Hurricanes. Tsunamis. Volcanos. Floods. There are dangers everywhere. Might as well die in a pretty spot with a legal joint in your hand.  I think we get a fair bit back from the state in return for those taxes. I'm ok with that.  Immigrated here* 25years ago son. Not that it matters. Because I won't argue with anyone who calls 75F summer. Y'all are taking this way to seriously. [heres your gatekeeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/9gcewt/both_of_seattles_seasons_in_one_shot/e63rt2d/?st=jm5ng1vg&sh=b65d5783).  Lol... gatekeeping. Man, to such extremes with you. Simply can't take a joke huh? Noted. Enjoy your day fellow seattleite. I dunno why you're being downvoted when it's true. The PNW has some of the lowest occurrences of severe thunderstorms and thunderstorms in general in the entire US. [This graph is 2 years old but still relevant](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmI6kKdVYAAqK_h.jpg:large), as you can see Seattle was the only area in the entire lower 48 without a single severe thunderstorm warning for this time period. [And here's another map of average T-storm days per year.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uv7Lz7_G_gE/UeIr7zE2aJI/AAAAAAAAR2M/5pXvynV_7bk/s1600/Lightning2.gif) Seattle, along with the entire west coast, averages 0-10 per year. This is just what you tell yourself to feel better. A tornado is nowhere near as dangerous as the deathtrap the PNW sits on and there's significant warning beforehand and a tornado has never destroyed a city in human history, Seattle has the potential for tsunamis as well. 

It's pretty safe to say Seattle suffers from significant more dangers than a natural disaster free city like Chicago. [deleted] Been here almost 30 years, and yeah, thunderstorms are few and far between.
