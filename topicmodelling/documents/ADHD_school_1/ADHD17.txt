I FINISHED MY MASTERS I finally defended my thesis. 


It has taken me 13 years of post secondary education to finish what should have been done in 7 years. 

But it was worth it! I’m done and I fucking did so well!!!! 


I am literally so happy about this and can not wait to publish and show the world more and more of my stuff. 

Getting diagnosed in the last year made the biggest difference. 


Thank you to this community for being supportive throughout all of this. I love you guys. 


**EDIT: You guys are so amazing and supportive <3 I love all of you. Honestly, I don't think anyone outside of this community can really appreciate how much of a struggle it can be to get through life stuff. And being able to share and celebrate this with you guys makes it all the more meaningful. GO TEAM ADHD! *** So proud of you! I've been thinking of pursuing my masters and this gives me hope.  Yassss you give me hope!!!!! I'm in the process of returning to grad school after a 5 year hiatus from a one-year masters program lol Well done dude. I handed in my thesis just over a month ago and I genuinely had a break down and cried whilst handing it to my supervisor because it was such an overwhelming feeling. You deserve to feel on top of the world because this is so hard. Proud of u, I know how hard it is!!!!  Please help me, I can't focus enough on studying to get my associates. I've dropped out 4 times.  THATS FUCKING AWESOME!!! YOU DID IT!!! GO YOU!!! Congrats a million times congrats!! What was your thesis about if you don’t mind me asking?? I want to do my Masters as well, but am still working on balancing life/health first. I always love to know what other folks are publishing! Congratulations! I’m currently in grad school and this is inspiring to me.  Awesome. Congratulations. I'm 28 and at my third semester in community college after completely screwing up my first attempt. Just walked away from it all in the middle of class one day and didn't look back. I'm doing OK now, but still struggle daily with time management. Honestly the thought of even transferring to do more school gives me anxiety... What did you major in if you dont mind me asking?  Do you have any tips on this? I've been studying a degree part time for some time now, theoretical subjects are super easy but more practical science subjects are impossible for me  Saving this post for when I get overwhelmed with school.

I'm currently pursuing my bachelors after dropping out the first time. Second time around, I'm doing so much better. Your story puts into perspective that people with ADHD can make it through school (although we may need to work much harder than most to keep ourselves on track).

Thank you for sharing! Thank  you for sharing!

I hope to start my masters journey soon and this is inspiration . 🎉🎊👏👍🏻💃🕺 CONGRATS!!! THAT'S AWESOME!!!!! YOU RULE!! OMG CONGRATS!!!!!!!!! :D  Great job!!!  AMAZING. Congratulations!!!

*Master*  Congratulations!!!!! I flunked out of my M.ED after 4 classes, but I've been toying with the idea of going back now that I'm diagnosed and much better. You give me hope! Keep up the amazing job you are doing, I am so proud of you!!! Wow. Congrats! I'm in the process of attaining my Master's and it's hard. So fucking hard, especially with these ADHD and depression struggles. Sometimes I just want to give it up, but I know if I do I will regret it for the rest of my days. Thanks for the post.

I submitted my medical school applications today and I'm definitely not ready to finish my bachelors this year lool  Congratulations

&#x200B; Congratulations! You are a badass. Honestly, as someone who is in the first of two thesis courses and has three classes left, I needed to see this today. Thank you.  WELL DONE! 🎉 😁 Yay!!! Congrats, OP! 🥇🏆🏅 Congrats!  Wtg!!!!  So happy for you!!! 

Love,

Another ADDer going for a MS. Congrats! You did it you should feel very proud  Congrats!! As a person who one day wants to have a masters in psychology, do you have any tips for self motivation? currently in my first semester ever and motivation is very hard to find. I just want to be a psychologist because I like talking to people about their problems and I personally feel people who get diagnosed with ADHD early in their life get institutionalized and get labeled and that just makes it even harder for them to live as 'normal' people. Just punched the air for you dude. Just started uni, hope I make it.  Wow this is so inspiring! Congratulations  Hell yeah! Congratulations, you earned it! THATS AMAZING. Congratulations! 

&#x200B;

Thank you for sharing your journey with us!  CONGRADUFUCKINLATIONS! 

I started working towards my major late becuase I had to knock some prereqs out, also I've had some setbacks. But this career is something I want very badly. Some days I doubt if I will be able to accomplish my goal. 

I know what I have to do to succeed. I have some habits I will have to break, I will have to change some fundamental aspects of my personality. For the first time in my life, I'm asking for help. I'm signing up with the  disability resource center. I'm in the process of finding a new psychiatrist. I'm communicating with professors.  I was diagnosed with ADHD and major depressive disorder about a year ago. I wish I would have not blamed myself for everything and gotten help much earlier. 

Anyways, I just wanted to let you know your post means a lot to me and it makes me feel that just maybe, I have a chance.  [deleted] Good job!  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! :D WOOO!!! Congrats!!!!!!!!! You should be so proud! I can't imagine grad school without meds, I had a really rough time even getting through the first two years of undergrad before being diagnosed.  Your words are wise. 
Thank you very much! Congrats ! Took me 10 years to get my associates *sigh* Hell yeah!!

I'm struggling through highschool and shit like this makes it easier. Thank you for sharing Fuck yes !!!! Yay! I love you and congratulations!!!!   Fuck yes!  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!! YOU MUST HAVE WORKED SO HARD!!!! I'm really happy for you and proud of you. I hope I get there someday!!!! Great feat! Big accomplishment like this is encouraging for everyone. Thank you for sharing :D

...and I feel you. I took 10 years to finish my PhD. Like your case, I needed just one semester to defend one diagnosed and treated. It makes such a difference. Now we need to build ADHD coping skills for work though, haha. That is awesome! What an amazing accomplishment!! Congratulations! Congratulations!!!!!

I am trying to finish a dissertation while working FT and am 3 years later than expected so hearing stories like yours keeps me going!! OWWWW OWWWWW * YAAAAAAS* Epic 😊 It took me five years to finish my bachelor's and then three to finish my Master's. According to my University it should have been five years in total. Still, I'm glad it worked out at all. I rarely react when people I don't know post about their successes. However this is really awesome. I hope I will do the same one day. as someone who is starting his thesis a year late and got diagnosed recently, you're an inspiration! Good job dude! Congrats man, you fuckin made it. What's the next step? 

Currently trying to memorize every bone in the body. Kill me.  Woot! Congrats! 

I am graduating in December with my B.S. I've had all A's since I got on meds and returned to school two years ago.  Good job!! It took me 8 years to finish 3 year vocational school.. feels good man )) Wow! So proud of you! Thanks for showing us how it's done! Proud of you, OP!! This motivates me to finish my three classes & get my bachelor's. I love school but it can be so hard. To know you did the damn thing is inspiring. Congrats!!! CONGRATULATIONS! This is awesome and you're awesome. Good luck on whatever you do next :)  Congrats!!! Congrats! I'm two months from getting my bachelor's, so I'll be sharing in your excitement soon. 

What did you get your Masters in/what was your thesis on? THIS IS SO INSPIRATIONAL! 🦄  Congrats! So happy for you.  Holy shit on a cracker, you did it you magnificent beast!  Congratulations my dude!  Thank you for posting this!! I'm currently working on my masters and needed a boost. That’s awesome!! I’m really happy for you!  Hooray! Congrats, nice job!!!!

Took me 11 years to do a bachelor's, another 10 to finish a master's. It's like my symptoms were yelling and nobody listened.

 Congrats!!!

I am hoping within a year to be able to say the same- only 3 credit hours and my thesis project left before I snapped and dropped out. Has been on my mind ever since. Diagnosed just over 2 months ago (age 34) and feel like a completely new person, now that I'm in regular therapy and found a great combo of meds... And I can't stop thinking about finishing. Thanks for the inspiration! You should be so proud of yourself!  Thank you! Yes!! Go for it! it feels like pure hell at times, but having a supportive community has been so amazing. I'm here for you if you need advice or a pep talk as well! Are you going back to the same program or to a different one?  yaaassssss. I literally cried handing in my thesis and walking out of my defence.  my supervisor actually told me she teared up when i finally submitted my final document as well haha.  but thank you! it's such a grueling process, but we did it!! I struggled with this a lot on my path to nursing school. 

What helped me was finding ways to quiet my brain, I discovered a lot of quiet rooms in local libraries. Also switching tasks a lot, and finding ways to aid focus. I have a hard time sustaining attention with reading, videos helped with this. I HAVE BEEN THERE. it fucking sucks when you're in the thick of the shit storm. I feel you for sure. 

&#x200B;

What's your associates on? For me it made a huge difference to do something that I felt was important. I tried doing sciences beforehand and it was like a slow death - I actually got kicked out of school for flunking out of all my classes. 

&#x200B;

Once i started exploring I found that psychology was where I could actually find interest enough to go to class (albeit I was always late).. but once I started focusing on things that were of interest, it was easier to get through   


You can PM me if you want to chat more about this as well!  Up your dose, in conjunction with learning organizational skills.

I recently wrote a paper about, and started practicing guided yoga 1 to 2 times per week and Ive been struggling less with intrusive thoughts.  Step one.  Never say you can't focus.  It helps it become a self fulfilling prophecy.  You might struggle to focus, but you definitely can focus a little bit  THANK YOU YOU'RE THE BEST!! My thesis is on the experience of south asian mothers and disability in the school system :)  And totally get that you're working on life/health balancing as well! Definitely something that is a constant struggle for me too <3  Thank you!! And you got this too!!  Grad school took me to some dark places, but I'm happy to have trudged through all the self-doubt. It's worth it!! Thank you!! and congratulations to you too! I'm proud of you for going back!! Daily time management is still my constant struggle as well. In school, I was working non stop at the last minute. It wasn't easy, but I definitely did not have it "all together".. I think a big part of what drove me to finish it was because I felt passionate about the topic. I studied psychology, and focused on child development. My program is more practical-based, so I was able to relate it to actual kids and think about their lives. It made it feel more real and not so much like an abstract theory to think about. Understanding the diagnosis and getting medicated played a big part as well.. Not OP nor do I consider myself a master of time management, but I'm a physics student and I'll repost my comment from above about what tends to work for me and hopefully it will be of some use to you. 

 I'm still struggling to find what works but I have picked up some tricks that tend to work for me. I never had to study in highschool and never developed study skills. Once I got to university, I found my self procrastinating untill the last possible moment which resulted in many all nighters and ruined my sleep schedule so that I was missing classes. 

Regarding study spaces, I'm a commuter student so it's not practical to drive 30mins to campus to study regularly. So, I go to my local community college's library. I also have a study corner in my room that is only used for studying. Still trying to find out what location works best for me. 

I have a really tough time beginning tasks. It's like looking at Mt Everest and the amount of work seems intimidating to start. 

For me, breaking down tasks is key. I currently break down my work load into weekly chunks but I want to start implementing monthly chunks and eventually larger goals. 

I have a chalk board and I have separate columns for each class. I then add rows that each represent one day. I mark my deadlines for the week and I give my self one or two days to study the material if needed. Then I divide the number of problems I must complete by the number of days I have left to finish them. This at least gives me a guage to know if I'm working at a fast enough pace. 

It has the added benefit of allowing me to reward myself once I complete the day's tasks and play video games or do some other hobby. Also, some days when I happen to feel very focused or in the zone, I start working on the next days' problem set. For the first time in my life, I sometimes finish my work early, which I never thought was possible before. 

It's not bullet proof, some days I don't faithfully follow the schedule or I underestimate the time required to understand a topic of finish problems. But this is a major improvement over blindly doing work sporadically or having no idea about how long I think it will take me to complete my work. 

 Really the only approach that works it to practice, practice, practice. Whatever you need to do to stay on task, do it. If that's getting medicated, great. Before I was diagnosed, I would set a timer and I was not allowed to touch my phone or to get up from my desk until the timer was done. For Calc 3 I would do about 3 2h sessions on most weekdays, sometimes more or less depending on tests and hw length. Coffee also helped. Even though my mind would wander, I didn't give it anything else to latch onto so it would eventually come back to the problems at hand. Or you may be more goal-oriented than time-oriented, so say "I will not get up until I finish X." I would use ambient noise generators as well. I hope something here is useful to you! YES! YOU GOT THIS!! I totally know what you mean, I flunked out of school the first time around.  Us ADHDers can make it!  But the more you learn about yourself and the things you need to tailor your education around you makes the biggest difference.  It also helps to have such a supportive community.  PM me anytime you need a pep talk and your stressed with school! But you can totally do it!!  Man school sucks. Idk how I ever survived before Vyvanse. Yeesssssss! You should go for it!  PM me if you ever want to chat about grad school stuff, but you got this!! <3 

&#x200B; :D <3 !!! THANK YOU SO MCUH!!! YOU'RE THE BEST!!! THANK YOUUUU <3 <3 <3  Thanks friend!!!! <3 :D Thanks!!! eeee!!! yayayyy!!!!! YAAAYYYY :D Man, thank you so much!! <3 <3  Yessss!!!!! I don't know you either, but your supportive message gave me the biggest smile!! <3<3  YAY!! I know how intense it can be, and I'm soo proud of you too! We made it!! Yayy!!! Thank you!!!

&#x200B; Thanks so mcuh!! :D !!  Thank you!! <3 Thanks friend!! Yayy!!! Go us!!   lolololll dude the number reddit spirals I've fallen down, ahaha - You got this!!! I used [focusmate.com](https://focusmate.com) to help from procrastinating. someone in this reddit actually told me about it! :) bahahahah YES i'm so down for that!!  If you have access to meds now I would give it a shot, the difference is night and day. I can sit and study for literally eight hours if I want without my mind wandering at all. Not being hyperbolic. I literally don't think of anything but the problems I'm working on and it is amazing. THANK YOU!! and yes!! trust me, post medication it makes the biggest difference <3  PM me if you ever need a peptalk!!  Totally been there! ADHD-PI and Anxiety.. there were some dark days in this process, but having a counsellor and medication made a HUGE difference. Also having this community to vent to and to get suggestions and advice made me feel like i was not alone. Let me know if you ever want to chat about anything, or if I can help in any way! <3 We all in this together!! <3 THANKS! THANKS MAN!! i  <3 you AHHH FUCK YAAHHH THANKKK YOUUU  Thanks man!! YAS! We in this together 🙌🏾 Oh it took me that long to complete it, haha... I finished my undergrad in 7 years (that was supposed to take me 4 years), and my masters in 4 years (that was supposed to take me 2.5 years)

&#x200B;

Yup, I've been in post-secondary since 2005... haha, happy to be freed from the shackles of academia  Thanks!! The grad school work load was my biggest problem. It took me an extra year to complete everything, because I wasn't able to do my thesis alongside my courses or internship. I spent a lot of time stressing, but a lot shifted once I was medicated.  I would say try to see where you're the most productive and work with your body. I found I worked better at night and would try to schedule stuff later in the day, so I could sleep in.  Thanks!!! :D Haha, thanks so much "insert name"! <3 :D   Thank youuuuu !! Yayy!! thank you for messaging, you made me happy too :D  Thanks man!!! Thank you friend!!! <3 Yaaayyy!!! THANKS!! You got this too!!!!! lololl, I feel you!! but PROUD OF YOU! Submit those med school apps! We need more doctors that understand ADHD!  Thank you!!!! <3 YOU GOT THIS!! You are killing it and you are SO CLOSE!! Proud of you tooo!!! THANKS!!! :D :D :D  YAYYY YESSS us ADDers are out there making big moves !!!  Thanks so mcuhh!!!

&#x200B; I'm in psych too! self motivation is really hard for sure, my program is a little more practical-based, so it was nice to be able to apply the theory to real-life kids. I think that was the biggest motivator for me, to feel like what I was doing was going to make a difference.. I think what you've described is something similar. Knowing that people get labeled early on and that can impact their trajectory is something that can help to motivate you when youre working through. Thinking about ways to make mental health and ADHD less stigmatizing is a lens you can use in your work, and that can help to make that work feel relevant and important to you. Sometimes you have to take certain mandatory courses that feel grueling (..statistics \*barf\*), and for those ones I tried to work closely with a study buddy or with someone in that class to help keep me on track YES! I just punched the air for you too friend!!! YOU GOT THIS!! this community is so helpful and supportive as well ! you'll make it!  thanks!! :D :D  thank you dude!!!  Of course!! Honestly, I owe this community a lot! You guys have been with me through it all :)  DUDE!! YOU GOT THIS!! I'm so so proud of you!! It's hard as fuck going through life and having to deal with all the extra crap that comes with ADHD and Depression (or anxiety in my case).  

It's definitely not easy, but it's worth it to trudge through and prove to yourself that you can do it. And you most definitely can. 

You're already on the right path, communicating and getting the help you need to work through it all will make the biggest difference. Also having this community as a support can make a huge difference too. 

I was legit going to throw in the towel and quit as of February, I was almost a year past the deadline. All my cohort had graduated, and I was working but I wasn't getting paid the amount I should because I never finished my thesis..  but my supervisor told me she wouldn't let me, because I was so close. 

It was a full 2-3 months of just isolation and writing, sprinkled with some family drama, lol. Shitty as fuck. But honestly, having worked through it all made all the difference. Knowing that I could come face to face with all of my self-doubts, and work past them.. 

So, I mean, the degree is technically jsut a piece of paper.. but for me, it's physical proof that I should never doubt myself.  YES ABSOLUTELY!!! omg, i know... for years I just thought I was a "bad student" becasue I couldn't work without it being last minute and I couldn't handle more than 2 courses a semester (even though I was working non stop) .. but after the diagnosis, I felt like I could own a part of my identity  Thank you!!!  been there my friend!! BUT YOU DID IT!  <3  YESSS, you got this friend!! our little ADHD subreddit community is routing for you too!! Fuckking yessss!!!!! yayy I love you toooo!!!!  YOU WILL!!!! yayyy!!!!! THANK YOUUUUU  Hahah, i know right?? I always wonder what life would have been like if I were diagnosed earlier?? But i"m glad I worked through it all!  YES! YOU GOT THIS!! Full time work is sooooo tough when you have to write a dissertation! I had to do it when I had time off in the summer, I feel for you!! I can't wait to see you post about finishing on here too!!! <3  OOOOO-WWWEEEEEEEEE  Totally! It's worth it to see yourself grow and work through it all. It might be longer, but in the end you've made a huge accomplishment Yesss you will!! We got your back ❤️ Omg you were the same as me! I started a year late and got diagnosed at the end. Prepare to have your life shifted .... it’s like night and day working on thesis stuff post diagnosis. Good luck!! Let me know if you ever need a pep talk along your journey! It’s a long dark road but we got good people here ❤️ Thank you my duuude!!! 

Next step..... honestly??? I’m kinda considering doing the doctorate... I mean I’m medicated now, so academic life isn’t as teeth pulling. And I’ve always been passionate about what I’m learning. 

But I’m also working now. And I’m loving what I’m doing for work. And also being paid for the first time ... hahah I might just enjoy the spoils of my labour for now. 

Also yes! Memorize those bones!! Be a doctor that understands ADHD from the inside. We need you ✊🏾 Yaaaasssssssssss - this gave me the biggest smile! We are able to do anything, we just gotta level the playing the field with those neuro-normies  Yesssss it’s sooo worth it to make it to the end!! WE ARE KILLING IT!  Dude! We are all in this together! This success is our success, we all made it. I passed with a lot of support from everyone here. So I mean, thank you as well!! We in this together ❤️ Ommggg yesssss get those 3 courses!! I am there with you! It can feel like a fucking nightmare. But I really felt like it was worth it in the end. 

Message me!! Let me know if you need help with anything. 

I can’t wait to celebrate with you on your post about finishing your bachelors ❤️🙌🏾 THANKS DUDE!!  YESSSS!!! I can’t wait to celebrate your finishing with you too!!  

My masters was in school psychology - and my thesis was looking at the experiences of South Asian mothers with kids with disabilities in schools 😎 THANK YOU MY DUDE!!!  Thank youuuu Hahahaha HELL YES  Thanks my man!!! FUCK YAH FRIEND! YOU GOT THIS!!!! I AM CHEERING YOU ON AND SENDING YOU ALL THE GOOD VIBES !!!  Woooot! Right???? It’s like I always just thought I was a bad student ... even though I spent like all my time studying 

Looking back it all seems so obvious tho, haha Same one for better or worse haha I had multiple withdrawals and some pretty awful grades early on bc I wasn't diagnosed and I didn't know how to study or get done what I needed to get done.... and I was really hard on myself for it bc I pretty much felt like a failure. I'm pretty sure the sudden lack of structure going from a high school environment to a community college where no one gets called if you don't show up to lecture is what set it all off to snowball. I spent YEARS, approx 17-24 trying to make school work and not being able to make it work. The diagnosis, medication, a greater level of self-awareness, some stubbornness, and forcing myself to change my mindset about how I viewed my own behavior allowed me to turn it around. It probably took about 2 years after diagnosis and a few more repeats of the same type of behavior/mistakes for me to get on the other side of it as far as being successful goes.... I started by finishing the general AA degree that I had dropped in and out of over the years. Then I decided to be a nurse so I went back and took pre-reqs while waiting on a waitlist to get into an LPN program (no other program would have taken me with my grades). I worked my way up the ladder LPN-RN-BSN going to different programs for each. The whole time I had the high-level goal in the back of my mind that I was going to work to become a CRNA. Having a big picture goal helped to keep my motivation up and being an underdog as far as obtaining acceptance into a competitive graduate program also helped to keep me on track--- I'm stubborn and I wasn't about to give an admissions committee another reason not to give me a chance. What worked for me was making several smaller goals along the way. Daily goals, weekly goals.... I still find that I tend to live life week to week bc if I try to plan things out too far in advance I get both overwhelmed and am just not that great at organization (shocking, right?). Last year I sent applications out to grads schools.... I had to call the admissions office of one of the programs I had to apply to alter their online application to allow me to enter the amount of credits that I had (357... it maxed out at 300😂) I spent A LOT of time (when I went) at community college (and finished 2 AAs). Now I'm in my second quarter of CRNA school... it's possible to get on the other side of this, it's not easy, but it does get easier- each little success you have helps. And it's important to pat yourself on the back for those too. I would make a point to be proud of myself for seemingly simple things like turning in a paper before the due date... bc for me that wasn't simple. As far as study tips, even with attention deficit, everyone is going to be a little different. I can't study around others bc I'll find anyway possible not to study. Others need people around to help them stay on track/engaged. If you study at home I would make sure that you have a spot that is separate from your room that is explicitly for studying. I have a little office nook that I call my "hole" that I've spent pretty much most of my life in since starting grad school. Or like the poster above me said, go somewhere specifically just to study. Consistency will help too- once you pick a place or a spot, eventually your brain will associate "study mode" with that spot and shifting gears to work on school stuff becomes easier.  \^\^\^\^I used these tips as well!!

I also used ear plugs when I worked, I would get distracted by any slight noise. I found that I worked better at night, so I never scheduled anything before 11am, and worked at night time. The dry science stuff I barely passed, I was always more into psychology, so I just pursued that topic. I was required to take some sciencey based courses for my undergrad, but I tried to find the most humanities-style science courses I could  Thank you that means a lot :) Honestly, I wanted to include dexedrine in my acknowledgements page, lol  \*Excited flailing!\*  
I just got the e-mail saying my diploma is in the mail. Best feeling ever.  What was your thesis on??? That seems interesting. I think I'll give that a shot tomorrow. Thx for sharing 😁😁 Agreed!! <3 Thanks! I appreciate the kind words and support. I will definitely keep what you said in mind. Take care.  Thank you!! Proud of you too! That's a great achievement! 😁 Right now money is going to be my biggest issue, but I'll find a way! I'm actually very keen on surgery but I have no idea what I'll end up doing yet  Yea I heard that I might have to take calc for my class and I almost fainted. My ass can barely do college algebra. But I heard if I move to another campus in the system, I won't have to take calc and only stat. I'll try to use some of your tips man. Thanks for the response! <3 Thanks. :-)  Thank you! It means a lot! Thank you!!!  You can do it!!! Proud of you for going for it!  You got this! and you got a great team from this subreddit behind you <3 It's annoying when you have to go back, but you've got more coping mechanisms this time :)  Thank you for this. I’m starting pre reqs for nursing school in the spring. I’ve held off from college because I’m scared of failure. But you can’t succeed if you don’t take risks. 
Good luck in grad school. I’m sure you’re doing great  This is spot on for me. I'm still struggling to find what works but I have picked up some tricks that tend to work for me. I never had to study in highschool and never developed study skills. Once I got to university, I found my self procrastinating untill the last possible moment which resulted in many all nighters and ruined my sleep schedule so that I was missing classes.  

Regarding study spaces, I'm a commuter student so it's not practical to drive 30mins to campus to study regularly. So, I go to my local community college's library. I also have a study corner in my room that is only used for studying. Still trying to find out what location works best for me. 

I have a really tough time beginning tasks. It's like looking at Mt Everest and the amount of work seems intimidating to start. 

Like you said, breaking down tasks is key. I currently break down my work load onto weekly chunks but I want to start implementing monthly chunks and eventually larger goals. 

I have a chalk board and I have separate columns for each class. I then add rows that each represent one day. I mark my deadlines for the week and I give my self one or two days to study the material if needed. Then I divide the number of problems I must complete by the number of days I have left to finish them. This at least gives me a guage to know if I'm working at a fast enough pace. 

It has the added benefit of allowing me to reward myself once I complete the day's tasks and play video games or do some other hobby. Also, some days when I happen to feel very focused or in the zone, I start working on the next days' problem set. For the first time in my life, I sometimes finish my work early, which I never thought was possible before. 

It's not bullet proof, some days I don't faithfully follow the schedule or I underestimate the time required to understand a topic of finish problems. But this is a major improvement over blindly doing work sporadically or having no idea about how long I think it will take me to complete my work.  I went through this too!! age 18-25 were almost throwaway years, I was barely keeping it together. But it's so satisfying to look back and see how things have shifted :)  I decided to major in Aero Engineering. I don't think I have ADHD as bad as a lot of people on here but almost every day I wonder why I am doing this to myself because I'm so bad at school. Thank God for Vyvanse. YESSSSS!!! 

I just submitted the final document into the thesis publishing thing (of course I submitted it in a last minute panic, just before the deadline) 

But phhewwww, it’s DONE.  I was looking at the role of trust in the home-school relationship of minority parents of kids with autism ☺️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ You got ambition and that’s worth more than anything!!  Totally!! Let me know if I can help at any point, I’m all about pep talks. I was lucky to get lots of them through people in this community (and YouTubing rocky balboa clips). Good luck!!! Just try to be both firm and kind to yourself about your academics. If you slip up into old habits just try to learn from it and always keep your head in the game for what's coming up next. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere if I had dwelled excessively on my mistakes or failures. It took some trial and error for me to figure out what worked for me, and so don't be surprised if you find yourself falling into old patterns- just try to stay aware and call yourself out on it. Social support like family members or friends can help too if you have people you can recruit to help keep you on track. It's really not how many times you fail, it's how many times you get up and keep trying. I truly believe that. If you fall off the horse, get right back on, you'll eventually get there even if it involves taking some scrapes and a few detours.  I’ll try to implement some of these tactics in my life! 
High school was easy and I did pretty well without studying. I have to teach myself to study now. Day by day I suppose  These are amazing tips!! I'm going to use these as well, thank you!! I know that feeling! it’s not even about as bad or not. We all got shit, and we all go through stuff. Your struggle and pain is mine as well. 

It’s super shitty, but like you said thank god for stimulants and having a fighting chance to survive school. 

GOOD LUCK WITH AERO ENGINEERING THAT SHIT SOUNDS SO INTENSE!!! You got this!!!!  Mine was late...initially my professor wasnt going to take it. Apparently I needed to register for disability accomodation with the student disability services EVERY semester. What kind of bs is that? You expect someone with ADHD to remember to do that? Oy vey!
But, I explained that to her...cried a little...got my advisor to vouch for me...
She took it saying she'd dock me %10. Well guess what? She loved it so much she didnt dock me!  Exactly the same for me 😂 Eminem and Kendrick Lamar help me get through most days lol Glad I could help! btw are the numbers in your name your birthday? Because if so I was born on the same day as you :D Thanks dude. I'm sure that your life will be a lot less stressful now that you've finished grad school, good luck with your career! Haha nooo there was not much thought outside of button mashing when I came up with those numbers
