I admire people with super strong work ethics and *really* wish I could be that way. If you've been able to become that person, PLEASE share. I watch a lot of sports, and one that I always hear about all the greatest performers -- LeBron James, Tiger Woods, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, etc etc -- is that they all have such consistent work ethics. They wake up early, they are disciplined, they stay late, and they are successful as a result.

&#x200B;

I'm no professional athlete, but every time I hear one of those stories I feel \*so\* inspired to be that way in my own life and career. It just never happens. In my head, I \*deeply\* want to be a person who works super hard to perfect his craft. I just can't turn that desire into action.

&#x200B;

I'm not medicated yet (though I have an appointment in 2 weeks), I haven't tried CBT yet, and overall I think there's a lot of room for improvement left. What t I can't figure out is this: what is a realistic expectation for once I have all those supports in place?

&#x200B;

Has anyone gone from screw-up to consistent hard worker? Or is that too much to expect even with the right meds/therapy in place? I think the key is to reaquire wonder from time to time, and also to strive to work above your perceived limit. That keeps me terrified and Interested in my work and always having to be.learnjng and scrambling to keep up. For me boredom and knowledge are the enemy. I ended up in a job where I was so good I couldn't get promoted because no one could do my job as efficient or as passionately as me. That led to boredom a d  ow I've just changed jobs, but moved up in the ranks to a much better pay grade, but also much higher risk/rewards. So now I have to master new skills and stay ahead again for the first time in years. Find a broad field your interested in and it helps to have lots of areas of expertise to gain. Hope this helps good luck!   I have been that way, for certain things. Not most things. I think the trick is to combine a passion with obligation, structure, stimulation, and ego. 

For me, it was a cooking/expediting job. I’m not sure why I loved it so much or why it felt so important, but I had so much fun every shift and I worked really hard and stayed late to help. For the first time in my life I felt like I was trying to my full potential. It had all of those factors. 

Obligation: it was the type of job where somebody calling out or not pulling their weight affected everyone else. 

Structure: I knew what I was supposed to be doing and when, and people would get me back on track immediately if I didn’t. 

Stimulation: there was never not something to do with my hands. Constant motion. I wouldn’t get tired until the rush was over, and then I just had to clean up a few things and leave. The adrenaline really carried me through. 

Ego: I was the youngest employee and I really wanted to prove myself and feel mature. There were people I respected so, so much and I wanted to do right by them. 
 People say do what you love... that's bull. Well maybe for us with ADHD. I have dozens of things I love, but rarely commit with any if it.

Instead, find something you find easy that most people would say is hard. For me, it's software development. Trying to find bugs/optimize code/fix a process is my dopamine fix. For you it might be a number of other things. Funny thing is, I don't especially love the actual programming part. But it comes naturally to my brain that goes a 100 directions at once. Even on meds, I go in fewer directions but more are actually fiscally sound. >Has anyone gone from screw-up to consistent hard worker?

Yes.

I spent my childhood and adult life in a school system hell. It drove me to depression and suicidal thoughts from when I was 10 to when I was 23.

It sucked, but finally, after graduating college, I escaped.

Hyperfocus is, perhaps, the only major advantage of ADHD. When obsessed with a topic, those with ADHD will suddenly outstrip their peers, both in performance and work effort.

There is a single, dream-scenario for those with ADHD: a job which they can hyperfocus on something productive for hours upon end.

Somehow, after months of unemployment, I have found this magical life foisted upon me within the past month. At 24 years old, my company pays me stupid amounts of money to spend 8-10 hours a day studying and developing with an emerging network engineering technology.

I abhored my coursework. I graduated with a degree in engineering. It took ever fiber of my being to graduate with multiple internships. Rigid curriculums give me terrible anxiety. Near-daily deadlines send me into a state of paralysis.

However, my current position gives me the freedom to *choose* what I work on. My tendency to wander, to spend days and weeks learning the ins and outs of an interesting topic, has transformed from a significant weakness into a great strength.

The money has given me the financial freedom to pursue my personal goals. Frankly, I value hard work over anything else. I have been surrounded by gifted individuals my entire life. Potential means nothing to me, but the utilization of potential is literally everything.

Emotionally, I believe there are a few traits that prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that someone is exceptionally hardworking and intelligent:

* They are an expert at their job, and worked hard to obtain it. Preferably, it's something difficult that they are passionate about.
* They are skilled/passionate about something creative (ex. piano, singing, guitar)
* They are wealthy
* They are educated on modern news/politics/whatever, and aren't a dick about it
* They are physically fit, and do some crazy outdoor activity (ex. rock climbing, long-distance running)
* They are knowledgeable about a wide range of topics.
* They're personable, and enjoyable to be around.

My life goal is to work towards emboding those traits. This is what I want from life.

With my recent position, I've started on being an expert at both my difficult job and at being wealthy. With my newfound financial resources, I've bought the piano keyboard I've wanted for half a fucking decade. I'm mostly personable/enjoyable to be around in person. I'm now able to put time towards being physically fit. I'll be able to get a discount towards the rock climbing place I've been looking at. I can finally afford to take me and my sister skydiving.

You know, what's fucking hilarious about all this shit is that I just needed to *like* my fucking day-to-day and not have to worry about money. Like, that was literally it. Whatever gets you closest to that state is what you should pursue.

My life changed instantly after getting my current job. I no longer feel trapped. I study material loosely related to my job when I go home. This week, I've started replacing beer with smoothies, seltzer, and piano. I'll be getting my prescription back within the next few weeks due to my newfound insurance, and honestly, I don't feel like I need the meds. I'm finally *home*.

My recommendation is to find something you like that makes reliable money. Pursue that with all your strength. Once you are financially stable, invest in yourself. Find your drives, your goals for yourself, and build them up.

Idk if this is actually useful, but hopefully it gives hope or something. I can answer questions if it would help. I failed four classes in undergrad, have been suicidal, and have a drinking problem. When I'm at now is everything I've ever wanted. I do too many things for a normal person to handle. All my life people told me I had to focus on one thing, but when I decided to do ALL the things, life became easier. I am a physician, I ride bicycles, build custom vintage motorbikes at a local collective, volunteer at the community health clinic or homeless shelter or at the encampments, I play guitar and performed again recently. I just take all the energy and use it. I stopped trying to do one thing as it exhausted me but having a lot on my plate (most of it not mission critical) let’s me perform better at my real job. Coworkers think I’m crazy, or bipolar, but I only have had one mode, and any efforts to slow down have failed.

As a kid, when I dropped out of sports to “focus on school” I did worse.

Oh and I take medicine regularly and set timers and do all that other stuff. That’s another thread entirely. Not sure what you mean by work ethics...
But I do have my qualities. I have trouble getting on time but once I'm in, I'M IN. I am the reliable person. When shit hits the fan, I'm the one people call for help. I'm CONSTANTLY looking for opportunities to help coworkers and clients, to make things better. I think ahead, when people ask me for something I'm like "ALREADY DONE IT" or I'm getting out of my way to help because I overheard someone commenting about struggling with a particular problem, or overheard a phone conversation so I'm already working on it although no one has even asked me to do it.

You know, putting all of this in words made me feel like a lunatic.

Anyway, back to ethics, I do "wrong" stuff all the time. I have a hard time seeing the line that divides right and wrong. I break rules, as long as I'm planning on a greater good and not causing harm to anyone. To be honest I couldn't care less about rules except for the risk of getting caught. The thing is: most people agree with it, all above considered (mainly, do no harm).
I lie for my own benefit (for example, lying about what caused me to get late; lying about what caused me to leave boring and routine tasks unfinished, etc.).

I'm a mess.  This is like when an interviewer asked Bill Gates and Warren Buffett what the secret to their success was and they both answered with a single word, "Focus".  


When I heard that I thought "Welp, I'm screwed"  


Can't even focus enough to figure out how to get medicated. A few thoughts on this. I've come to think that there is a category of highly successful people that are biological/neural outliers, especially after listening to lots of podcasts and interviews with people like Herb Kelleher, who states that he just doesn't feel stress, never has. I see it like this: if I have neurospecificity, they also have it in their own way. I don't stress so much after reaching this conclusion - I'm wired my own way and imitating someone else's formula won't help me. 

I've also come into close contact with a number of highly successful people in the fields I've worked in and I have to say - most of them are fucked. One's sleep cycle is so out of wack from stress and overworking that she's started having thyroid troubles, once a project she has a nervous breakdown from which no one is safe, her daughter has been ignored or screamed at when she's in melt-down mode for most of her life. A person in my "dream job" once sincerely told me that he's juggling too much and is just doing all of his work badly at this point. Another told me that he has days where he just zones out and can't concentrate at all and none of his friends call because he works and travels so much. Another is the "up late, up early" - he can't sleep due to incredible anxiety, regularly drafts insane letters to his staff at 3 am and the "super successful company" is so toxic they've had 50% turnover in 2 years. Let me tell you that from the inside, working with these "highly successful people" is more often than not, a nightmare. That insane drive you admire often comes from a very unhealthy place, at the cost of relationships, happiness and health. I have also found that, more often than not, they are not very nice people. 

I don't strive for that kind of success anymore. It's much more important to me that I remain sane, calm, and kind to myself while I try to make small, incremental steps that are sustainable so I don't burn out. My boyfriend is one of these people and he's really pushing to help me be the same. We're coworking today to help me find a better job. He's looking at jobs. I've spent three hours shopping for a table. Essentially a daily routine is very important. My therapist said that adhd people get very overwhelmed easily and therefore consistency is our best friend!  I am known by my friends and colleagues as insanely productive. I can tell you what works for me: obsession. I am obsessed by philosophy and languages and so I learn them very quickly. The trick is finding something that you can be obsessed by and to which you can devote tens of thousands of hours: I have trouble imagining being productive 'in general'. Watch motivational speech/songs on YouTube. Especially when you're feeling like giving up.
Exercise almost everyday to get in a routine and it's pretty easy after a couple weeks.
This is all of youre looking for a more active lifestyle. Works for me Without out sounding like a total guidance counselor, do what you love or what you are passionate about. I currently work in marketing for a Montessori school. Not something I thought I would ever do, but I have always been creative and an independent worker. I know what my career goals are down the line and plan on building towards them. You dont need a glamorous job, so long as you have some joy in it. I loved working retail when it was for a sex shop as I am very sex positive. I was not happy working for a basic/overpriced clothing company because I didnt give a fuck about the products/company.  Get your meds and you’ll become that person in about 15-20 minutes  I joined the marines. That helped.  Just learn to use your hyper focus and try to minimize the inattentive periods. Exercise helps.  First things first, you should not compare yourself with the outliers. 

Have you ever taken a personality test (like Big5) and read about conscientiousness? The people you are mentioning are probably among the 0,01 percentile in this trait. 

I have had a discrepancy between my own experience of how conscientious I am, and how conscientious I appear to others - Me feeling really conscientious and with a good "work ethic", only to see how others view me as lazy and not trustworthy. 

I hypothesize that this discrepancy (how I view myself in this regards vs how others view me) is what has made my ADHD harder to live with. 

Being diagnosed and medicated finally (!!!) made it all good. Now I`m able to get an overview of a situation, organize, make plans, keeping track of it all, and get things done. 

I get up in the morning, spend a few hours by my self, reading books, working out, having breakfast, and getting ready before have to wake up the kids and start the day. It`s so smooth now. And I go to bed early in the evening, which would never happen before. 

I haven`t had CBT yet, but 4 months into medication. You should have great hopes, but also note that you may not be as lucky as I have been. Many people tries many different meds, and with varying results. I`m grateful for my situation. 

But yeah, dare to expect anything if you can handle a minor set back. 
 My first job out of college, I took right off and did amazing, hard worker, smart, got things done (or, got them started, at least.) It was a combination of it being new/interesting and the constant fear that I was going to fuck up majorly and let everyone down (it was a better position than I was qualified for). 

When I ended up leaving that job 2 years later, several people complimented me on my work ethic. It almost brought me to tears, because I'd never been described like that before. 

So, my advice is to get the panic monster involved.

Except that all wears off for me, and I'm sitting in another 2-year rut in my current job, and basically on reddit all day :/ Been trying to avoid medications but it seems unavoidable if I want to continue to function. Understandable. I got a bit more productive again by accepting my limits. Sounds strange, but you lose less energy when you stop hating yourself.

&#x200B; I feel like I’m getting there. I have my moments. I find that once I have purpose and a path to get there. I can do it. I spent a day organizing my life. And once I get going. I can keep going.  Start small, *don’t give up*, and you’ll find big changes will follow. 

It starts with little acts of control and discipline. You know what habits you have that detract from your success. Too much social media, games, etc. Moderate or completely stop those things. It’ll be hard, but you need to stick with it.

After a couple weeks of small successes your brain will be ready for bigger challenges. Try a pomodoro timer. 25 minutes of sustained focus, then 5 minutes to relax. DO NOT use those 5 minutes to browse social media or text friends. Reflect on what you’ve done and what you will do. Work your brain like this daily as you would a body workout and you’ll significantly increase your ability to focus.

Work up to intervals of one to four hours of [deep work](https://medium.com/@nina.semczuk/5-practices-from-deep-work-by-cal-newport-thatll-change-your-life-303847ec5f3c). This is a technique championed by professor and productivity researcher Cal Newport in his book Deep Work. That means zero distraction. I silence my phone and toss it into a bin. Calls or texts can wait. Look into this. Also, eat and sleep better and everything else will come more easily. Goes without saying.

I’ve spent the past four months reforming myself using these tips and I’ve nearly improved into a new person. I wish I had disciplined myself like this years earlier to finish university but hindsight is 20/20. Here’s where you and I are NOW. Start focusing now and we’ll make up for that lost time and I’d say even get ahead of where we’d be. Good luck.  I second kitchen jobs! They’re everywhere, so you wanna make sure you find a good fit, but it’s always go go go which for me, is great. I found my passion early on, and at first, it was an absolute drag. But now that I’m on my medication, my boss couldn’t be happier with me. 

Even my school work has improved, and I actually started my paper before the night it was due. I think getting on the right medication will help, but also building a good support network and sleeping at a constant time is the best thing right off the bat.  I wouldn’t say my work ethic is super strong, but it’s definitely grown over the years. Looking back, I think I had this subconscious thought in my mind that everything would be okay, and I never had to try hard for anything. So from elementary school all throughout high school, I got terrible grades and developed an embarrassing sense of work ethic. In retrospect, I think it’s because the next step in life still allowed me to be comfortable where I was in life. So elementary school to middle school - not a big change. Middle school to high school - not exactly the greatest challenge in life to complete. High school to college - Well community college is free where I live so I don’t have to try hard to go to college. Now this is where I had the sudden urge to change my ways and give myself a sense of discipline. What’s after college? A job. The real world. Bills. Everyday expenses. Then things got put into perspective. I have nothing to lean on, now that I’m in college. It’s due or die for me. I need to be successful in life. Acknowledging that my future is now solely in my hands gave me the drive to work harder. A lot about wanting a strong work ethic is self recognition and weening out of bad habits.  I find a bunch of little things too do thag all help. Like "I'm sorting these gloves" the 5 mins later "let's check on thouse goggles to make sure there straight"  I'm a Rockstar I love what I do...put me in the wrong job and I'm fucked....It took me over 30 years to figure that out Realistically. You’ll still get this feeling, but less so. I feel MUCH more accomplished and am inclined toward higher dedication when medicated. I’ve also been doing CBT albeit not specifically for adhd. It’s nowhere near 100% but for me I’d say it goes from like 15 to 60 (100 being a perfect max)  A lot of their work ethics lies in there habit as you've said, and even if you have ADHD it is possible to create and follow habits.  I had to find more fun ways to get the things done. Usually music helps but for example I need to learn all the amino acid structures and I created a memory game and found apps that quiz me to help me be motivated. Hope that helps.  I was always that person. Just a person with ADHD that had that. I always had to. Grit is working hard and failing and not getting up and doing it again.  Sorry* getting up and going it again  I think there are plenty of people out there like this, pretty sure my boss is one, but there's also lots in the entrepreneurial space.  The key is finding work that you love. On my most productive days, I organise prior. List of things to do, including time frames. Materials required.

Most importantly, I get up early.

I'm in construction so the work is physical, and if it goes well it's easier to keep focused.

Cant work clean, so I ensure it's easy to clean. Worth taking the time to prepare the workspace.


Note I run my own company, took some time to get to that stage but I don't do well as an employee for various reasons. Many people with adhd are like that, running a business gives you that drive to keep going.  I just made a main post about it, but I built a timed lock to keep me in a room with no other options than to study. So far it looks promising, I really hope that this will let me do the tasks I am supposed to, and want to do. I feel unhappy and crippled with this perpetual novelty seeking behaviour that will ruin my future. Work has been like school, I don’t know if I’m doing the best or the worst but I get unwanted attention from both  Anxiety does it for me.  So here's my experience when it comes to trying to study with and without meds, which will hopefully give you an idea. 

Throughout University I was known for classic ADHD behaviours, so being easily distracted, leaving things untill the last minute etc, I scraped by and got a very good degree classification (2.1 in MEng General Engineering, I'm from the UK), this was without medication, or diagnosis. I was lucky to have a good support network and did well in the project work. 

Then I got a job in investment management and wanted to take a professional qualification to further my career, so started studying again, I took longer than my colleagues to finish studying for the exam, but still passed first time. This was again without medication. 

A year later I was taking the second part of the qualification, I had been diagnosed and was medicated so studying came a lot more naturally. However I failed the exam. I'm putting this down to stress and anxeity regarding my living situation as during the week before my ex best friend gave me two weeks notice that she wanted out of our flatshare, and I had to find a new tenant or move out. 

What I'm trying to get at here is that there is a chance getting stuff done might come a little easier with medication etc, but it doesn't guarantee success. 

&#x200B; Think less and do more. It's all about action. Do whatever it takes to get it done.  Honestly, accountability is it for me. I probably won't get up at 6 am to work out before work unless I'm meeting a friend for a run or for an exercise class. I probably won't start early on that project unless I know what will happen if I wait til the last second (i.e. a client will be disappointed, I'll look foolish, etc). I probably won't spend Saturday morning cleaning unless I tell my husband I will, and he judges me when I load up my video games before doing the laundry.

Another trick for me was changing my mindset about what it means to be avoidant about tasks. Think about why you avoid certain tasks - are you afraid of failing? Does it just seem "not fun?" Does it seem overwhelming? Being avoidant doesn't mean you're a screw up or not a hard worker, it means your brain is wired to avoid certain activities until it's necessary. Realizing that for me has helped me to chastise myself less for not getting things done. Instead I ask, WHY don't I want to do this? And is that a valid reason not to? I'm still not perfect but it at least lowers my anxiety! one thing I've always been commended on is how hard of a worker I am. The only way I am able to be a hard worker is to be able to have many things to do at once. I've worked retail for the last 8 years, and I always liked to work on multiple things at one time during the day.

Today I am starting a new job at a call center and I am worried about my ADD. I'm worried I am going to be bored and fidgety because this job seems like it's going to be boring and mundane. Honestly, I think the fact that we are showing up every day at jobs is proof of an incredible work ethic; just being there can mean working twice as hard as your colleagues before the day or shift even begins. To echo some of the other comments here, do something challenging and make sure you keep asking yourself how you can do it better. I don't know if I count as having a super strong work ethic, but I graduated college with a bs in neuroscience with honors and am currently a grad student getting my masters in neuro where ive done very well on all my tests thus far, so take from this what you will. Also, I understand the irony of how long this post is and that reading it is a chore, so I numbered each paragraph with a header to tell you what that paragraph is about.



First thing I wanna say is that however you are right now is perfectly acceptable; you are enough just the way you are. But that doesn't mean you can't improve the parts of you that you wish to strengthen. This is where I have lots of experience, since I am very hard on myself, which keeps me humble and keeps me under tight control.



1. Dealing with procrastination:

Procrastination is going to happen. Its a fact. Its not going to go away, so lets try and formulate a plan that accounts for it rather than one that attempts to negate it altogether. The way I do this is by finding compromises within myself under the criteria that whatever needs to get done will eventually get done. If I wanna watch an episode of a tv show now thats fine, but afterwards ill do work. This is obviously easier said than done, but acknowledging it and practicing it will make it second nature.



2. The hardest part is starting:

For me, the very act of starting a task is objectively more difficult than the task itself. I once spent 5 hours trying to motivate myself to start something that took about 20 minutes. Without the ability to explicitly control our attention spans, we are at the whim of the waves of motivational momentum our implicit mind dictates. Because of that, it makes shifting that momentum a very difficult task. We don't have breaks, so we gotta find ways if slowing down enough to safely turn or find something that lets our implicit mind yank the emergency brake and shift our attention rapidly for us. Once you start something and start to get the ball rolling, the activity is much less difficult than the awfully biased mental concept we'd built up. 



3. Routine, routine, routine:

You know what one of the best ways to force yourself to do something is? Make it a habit so that you don't need to explicitly decide to do it anymore. I use mouthwash, floss, and brush every night. Last year, I rarely even brushed and never flossed. I tried starting it one day and promised myself I'd stick to it. I didn't give myself the option to not do it, it just has to happen. And soon enough, its easy to motivate myself to do it every night.



4. Note taking:

This one is something that has been an immense help to me through college and grad school. Paper gets lost. I take a piece of paper I want to hold onto and I stuff it in a drawer for safe keeping. If I need to find that paper again in the future, its probably lost forever. So I turned to electronic note taking. I use an ipad, an apple pencil (though any stylus will do), and an app called goodnotes (though there are tons of apps just like it). I can open pdfs or power point presentations directly from my email or through blackboard. I can save all my textbooks in one place and I can search them for key words. I can physically write or highlight class presentations so I only need to write the useful info, saving me time. Its a way to organize all my notes and books in one place that's customized to what I want or what works for me. 



5. Know yourself:

I know this is vague and im sure you've all heard it before, but I'm talking about getting down into the nitty gritty about what you like, what peaks your interest or your curiosity. If you find an aspect of what you enjoy and tie it in some way to what you don't enjoy, you might find yourself having a much easier time doing the thing you don't like. And be nonjudgmental of who you are. I come from a family that likes very traditional popular  music like led zeppelin and queen, and I love them too, but when im hunkering down and coding, I like punk rock music to hype me up. My family has had an oddly elitist view on music, so I didnt vocalize my interests much but now im not ashamed of my interests. Its part of who I am and if it brings me joy in a way that doesn't harm anyone else, whats the issue?



6. Audiobooks are amazing:

I completely stopped reading books for pleasure after highschool because I can't get through one. They're long, its mentally tiring, and the black and white text makes it hard to pay attention. I instead turned to audiobooks (some of which you can find on youtube as videos). I "read" daily now, and don't listen to anybody who says audiobooks aren't reading. I can discuss the characters of Dune or the various circles of hell in Dante's inferno in the same way as someone who read the books. Reading gets me through bus rides, through my walk to class, it helps me fall asleep at night. For me, reading is replacing that background noise we can't tune out with an educational, interesting, and stimulating dialogue I enjoy. Plus audiobooks are absolutely amazing for long car rides.



Sorry for the immense length. If you guys ever wanna talk or need a friend or something, I'll do my best to respond. I am very busy, but I find time for the people I care about.


Edit: um... Reddit why did you change my 1-6 numbered points to only "1."s?
 
      My parents told me if I failed any of my classes this year and couldn't get the Zelle Miller scholarship then I wouldn't be able to go to Kennesaw State and move out so I sat my ass down and did an assignment. Just need a big scary thing in the distance, the scarier the better. Well, you have to work **at** something. It should be something you deeply want, and deeply enjoy, but I also find it helps if theres a bit of a call to action around it "If I don't do this, I'll be stuck at my dead end job forever" or something like that.

Then you don't rush it, but you do work at it every day. And that means every day, weekends especially. And you get up earlier if you have to (but don't go to bed later, trust me, go to bed on time).

Set up some [smart goals](http://hr.virginia.edu/career-development/employee-performance/employee-resources). This is a long term project, so get like a project management tool or something.

How do you keep your ADHD from kicking in and stopping you? This is the key, this needs to be the thing you do **when** your ADHD kicks in. This is the thing you obsess over now. This keeps you up at night (but try to go to sleep). This destroys your relationships and your eating habits lol. It's no longer TV, now it's this.

Which is why you have to both want it and love it.

And if you fail, you don't start over, you keep going. You got **somewhere** in that time, now where can you go from here?

&#x200B;

Also, app recommendation, [Fabulous](https://thefabulous.co/) Regarding CBT, it helps gain or refine skills that circle around mindfulness. Reframing initial thoughts, SMART, and... other activities, are ways to observe how we react, and maybe even have a decisive say with our mind.

I'm going through the struggles of understanding and plainly paying attention to conversations and lectures, and these ways of living with how I typically react help me. The easiest way I've found to have discipline is to be absolutely obsessed with it. My work ethic (albeit not bad at all) is nothing compared to the amount of work I put into the things that grab my attention. It doesn't even feel difficult to get done what I need to when I'm all in on the activity. 

My suggestion is find your passion, and maybe look into putting all your eggs into that basket and making it work for you financially  The phrase "reacquire wonder" just about stopped me in my tracks because it completely sums up the struggles I have in my life. Thank you so much for sharing. Yeah I've noticed Computer Science is a good option for this type of work. It's my major and I love it, albeit it's frustrating like half the time lol. I'm currently stuck with the same problem as you. The company I work for cannot "afford" to lose me in my current position because no one has ever come close to being as good as it as I am. So I keep getting told to hold on until next time [deleted] The same exact description of my job to the fucking T. I am also the youngest employee in a cooking/expediting job where there is always something to do and during rush time I never get tires or want a break. I have loads of fun with my coworkers and many of them have told me that since i joined the whole dynamic changed and everyone is enjoying themselves a bit more. My only downside is that i can't close for shit since its so slow and tedious for me lol. I feel like I'm in a super similar position to you!

I'm the youngest person in my kitchen too, stayed as dishy 2 weeks ago and I'm now prep cook :D

A passion for what you do along with the obligation to not let others down is what makes me think ill never ever get bored of this industry..  I say find what you love...take risks....have fun...don't have pre-set expectations on ANYTHING I would say, find something that excites you, or “keys you in.” I only work on things and have a good work ethic with things I truly find interesting. It’s a thing where my brain actually clicks into place and I am passionate about finishing enough to not be distracted. 

I happened to find that “thing” early and then was able to have a career around it. But many a year as a teenager was spent doing customer service, my personal hell. Sadly I am annoyingly good at it. 

Anyway, I would definitely say that what you’re doing has to click into place. Then you’ll have the motivation to build a routine around doing that thing.  Yep, this exactly explains what I did. I fell ass backwards into a Cybersecurity job and it just so happens that I'm pretty good at it. I don't love it, it's not exciting, but I'm good at it, and that's enough to keep working hard. It also helps that it happens to be a field with essentially 0% unemployment so if you are good at it you can write your own paychecks. 

I also found an amazing mentor in my boss who challenged me to be the best that I can and he really encouraged me to put 110% effort into my job.  I wanted to ask, how was getting into programming for you?  I feel I REALLY struggle reataining what I learn(with everything, not just programming, but doubly so there). Be careful with your Euphoria here - there's a healthy chance that this new role will not be as exciting for you in six months time and you'll be back to how you were before.

It's a common issue.

Your advice is great though - something you like that makes you financially stable, then invest in yourself and make your entire life as adhd friendly as possible. > There is a single, dream-scenario for those with ADHD: a job which they can hyperfocus on something productive for hours upon end.

Oh my God. Please, somebody give me this. (I'm really enjoying programming at the moment; on my days off, I sit down to teach myself in the morning and get up invigorated but starving and busting in the late afternoon. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I'm seeing this as an actual career I can maintain and it is freaking me the hell out.) I love this: "My recommendation is to find something you like that makes reliable money. Pursue that with all your strength. Once you are financially stable, invest in yourself. Find your drives, your goals for yourself, and build them up."

Or like u/thedragonturtle said, "find something you like that makes you financially stable, then invest in yourself and make your entire life as adhd friendly as possible."

What an epic life hack. I'm writing this in my journal today.

&#x200B; OMG I AM ALSO A PHYSICIAN! I am currently in my first year of residency and find that I feel super stimulated by being on the wards such that I often feel like I'm in "flow" or "hyperfocus" when I'm at work. My problem is that I can never keep my shit together \*outside\* of the intense structure of my workday to do all the reading of journal articles, board prep questions, etc that it takes to pass one's boards and build a solid fund of knowledge. Do you mind if I PM you to discuss further? This really rings true for me. I find that I am at my happiest and most calm when my schedule is packed. I have no choice except to do everything I’m supposed to because there is literally no other time for me to do it! Came here to say basically that.  Most productive time is when I have somewhere I need to be at all times.  When I was in Law School year 1 grades suffered.  Year 2 got a clerk job and joined an extra cirricular resulting in 16 hour days 5 a week and 8 hour days on the weekend.  

It isnt just being busy though, it's having multuple places to be and thungs todo.  If I did the same stuff but it was divided up 1 type of task per day I wouldnt have been productive. But my God are you self aware. Your insight about yourself is so detailed. I'm in awe because I feel so vaguely aware of who I am as a person but you're so honest to the fine details.  You're not alone. In psychology, there's a theory about the different levels of moral development. Sounds like you're hanging out in the postconventional level with the rest of us [cool kids](https://i1.wp.com/gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/more-like-guidelines-gif-2.gif?w=640). :P Wow. This really, really spoke to me: "If I have neurospecificity, they also have it in their own way". You're right to say that it doesn't make sense to compare myself to those people. The thing that sucks is that I feel like my neurospecificity holds me back whereas theirs propels them towards success. They just so happen to be neurodivergent in perfectly useful ways, at least professionally. I envy that for a lot of reasons. But like you said, the "insane drive" that I admire also often comes at high personal cost which I don't want.

Your comment inspires me to: (a) work harder on make small steps rather than beating myself up for not already being on the moon and (b) remember that the shiny professional success I see some people having often doesn't tell the whole story. This is excellent and totally true in my experience too. Thanks for sharing and backing up my more recent conclusions!  Lol that ended exactly as I thought it would 😂 God I do not have a daily routine at all. Not in the slightest. I've tried a bunch of times, but it's fallen apart every time. This makes me think maybe I need to humble myself and get medicated rather than trying to brute force my way to a solid routine. This is really good advice. I should make a playlist of motivational videos that I can go to any time I'm feeling down or discouraged by my struggles. makes me sad to see comments like this bc medication did not work that way for me at all and i wish it did. it gives me like a 10% boost but i still feel so disorganized in my head no matter what and it makes it so hard to start and finish things Can confirm Can confirm as well  I keep seeing this all over this sub and it's finally motivated me to get off my ass and see a doctor again. For some reason I keep falling into the "Maybe I actually don't need them??" trap with consistently awful results.  It's essentially outsourcing your own work ethic. 

&#x200B; I've said this elsewhere on this thread but man, your story gives me so much hope and inspires me to get medicated. I've tried to "brute strength" my way through life for far too long and have been beating myself up for not being able to.

"I get up in the morning, spend a few hours by my self, reading books, working out, having breakfast, and getting ready before have to wake up the kids and start the day. It\`s so smooth now. And I go to bed early in the evening, which would never happen before." 

This sounds like you've achieved a pretty significant life transformation after getting the proper treatment. Kudos to you. Fingers crossed that I find similar success in changing my life. Man, I hear that so much. I've also been trying to avoid medications but I think I'm finally just accepting that while I don't want to be on them (due to internalized stigma, my own pride, shame, basically just a bunch of toxic thoughts that I need to work on getting over), what I \*really\* don't want is to be disappointed with my professional life by the end of it. And if getting medicated helps avoid that, then by God I'll take the lesser of the two "don't wants". I ... do not second them (kitchen jobs) ... I say don't do them ... :p

I was a professional chef for 10 years. I have been in every position in the kitchen from Sous Chef all the way down to dishwasher. 

It was a passion. I loved it. I have a degree in it. I can cook with the best of them, and make absolutely stunning dishes and meals for family and friends.

I sucked at it. I could not hold the details in my head and even though I loved cooking, I couldn't keep it together to make 100 identical plates. 

Or if it wasn't a big party situation, I'd end up doing little variations on each dish that went out the door... which means things are not consistent.

Consistency is key. When you go to your favorite restaurant and order your favorite dish, you want the same thing you got last time. You don't want whatever little change to the thing my brain did this time. 

So, while I am an amazing cook of wonderful food and have a passion for food.... the kitchen industry was horrible for me as unknowing ADHD sufferer 

(Maybe, with medication, I would have been able to do it -right- but alas, that part of my life is behind me)

 Oh my god 60% would be a dream come true. I would be so, so happy with 60%. I pretty much live at 15%. This gives me hope! Organizing prior is my biggest downfall. I don't do that very well at all. What did you do to get better at that?

Also, your last comment about running a business really resonates with me. The pressure not to let your business collapse is probably a huge natural stimulant. I actually went back to school for an second degree once I realized this. Haha nice I’m almost done with nursing school for the same reason Exactly the same for me. I was working part time as a student, while others were working themselves to the bone, so I would try to pamper them, make iced tea, bring candy, say nice things, etc. I felt like the thing that made me stand out was how much I cared. I definitely struggled with slow nights and remembering details for setting up and some other stuff. But it was ok because everyone could tell I worked hard and they would help me.  Congratulations on your promotion and I wish you the best on your cooking journey! It is truly a haven for us ADHDers and it’s a craft to be proud of, too. 

I’m somewhat leaving the industry because I’m finishing nursing school, but I KNOW I’ll be back someday. I’m gonna miss it too much.  But if so be prepared to live in debt, file bankruptcy, never "settle down" and start a family, etc.

ADHD causes what we love to do to change every couple months. If we keep changing careers, we'll always be at an entry level position. Instead, by choosing something that is easy we rarely find an excuse not to do it. Yeah, I work from home but ended up in a lucky situation where I report to a boss. I may not like it, but he keeps me on task.  I kinda just fell into it. I wanted to be an illustrator/artist. Started with graphic design - the programmers wouldn't implement my designs as well as I wanted - so I took up coding them myself. Eventually the bosses liked my code more than my designs and the design was offshored and I was placed in a developer role, which I fought tooth and nail. Eventually I gave in because I made money doing it.

&#x200B;

I don't retain anything. Meaning learning new languages is almost as easy as working in something I've worked in previously. I work best in an environment where one day I'm writing Visual Fox Pro and Windows Batch and the next day PHP and Bash shell.

&#x200B;

What I've found is if you fight what comes naturally, you'll fail every time. Meaning, if you can't "code in your sleep" perhaps you might be better suited for other pursuits. Not saying you can't, just know your brain will be fighting you everyday for the rest of your career with or without medication. I definitely think that my excitement will dwindle over time, especially as the negatives of the position begin to reveal themselves. My goal is to prevent my work-life balance from getting screwed up, and to try and put myself on projects I genuinely find interesting. 

Aside from that, I've just gotta build myself up to be strong enough to deal with the unexpected twists and turns that'll happen. A large portion of this will be to eat healthy, replace drinking with piano, and improve my social life. My therapist has definitely been helping with making all of this possible, so I might end up making the sessions weekly instead of biweekly.

Anyways, thanks for the caution! I've been slowly dealing with it, but haven't really looked it in the face till now.  UGH JOURNAL ARTICLES! The least interesting part about grad school. I just wanted practice and play music, not read 60 pages of dense scholarly writing every week. 

Meds helped so much with the reading! Before, it would take me at least a couple hours to finish reading a dry journal article and have a vague idea of what it was about. With meds, I could actually focus long enough to grasp everything a bit more and the task of sitting down to read was no longer like dragging fingernails on chalkboard.  Yea! Go ahead. It’s funny because your post, I can totally relate. Once first year is over it gets better! Uh... thanks?
Actually I've been thinking about how I act on the world for the last few months. I've been consuming lots of philosophy and psychology materials in order to decide who exactly is the person I wanna become (potential) and that requires careful analysis of who I am in the very present (what am I doing right? What brings me joy? What sort of day makes me feel like time flies and leaves me satisfied in the end, both in the workplace and in leisure time? But also, what am I doing wrong that I know I'm doing wrong, stuff that I'm able to perceive as detrimental, stuff that immediately triggers *that* voice in my head? How am I wasting time with stuff that doesn't even bring me any kind of satisfaction, such as mindlessly web browsing or stupid group chats?)  I highly recommend reading and actually reflecting on the speech by David Foster Wallace "This is Water".


I read it almost every week, as of it was some sacred text.

You know, we actually need to learn how to think and learn how to watch our thinking, thinking about what is that we are thinking about. That's not taught to us.

It's been years since I first read it and it did not exert much impact on me the first time. But something about it started growing inside of me. I became more and more obsessed with it, with David Foster Wallace life and work and eventually I found myself in this kind of "journey of self-awareness", one may call that.
I just hope to not become too self aware to the point of similar demise. But I'm fine.  I completely get your feelings and thoughts, and I’ve also spent most of my life getting down on myself, still do sometimes. I also highly recommend this article - [Darwin was a slacker and you should be too.](http://m.nautil.us/issue/46/balance/darwin-was-a-slacker-and-you-should-be-too). It really inspired me and put the work ethic of the most brilliant minds into perspective. 

The longer I’ve been in the workforce has also lowered my expectations towards myself and other people in the sense that we’re all struggling, some are just good at constructing good optics and those people get ahead professionally. Sports doesn’t necessarily fall into that category but there is a reason there are hundreds of pro athletes but there are only a limited few that are on the tongues of popular culture - charisma, good looks or juicy drama gets people talking. I really enjoy How I Built This, Tim Ferris’ podcasts and the CEO series on Freakonomics while doing boring chores because it gives me that perspective of how most don’t really work that much, and those who do are freaks of nature - I would literally fall apart on less than 6 hours of sleep consistently.

I feel like everyone needs a good motivation/interest in what they are doing and a little fire under their ass, people like us more than others. But that’s also what makes us insanely good when the stars align. Find out what makes you tick and what kind of work/environment makes you excel, and try to engineer your life to give you the balance that you need - it’s not easy and it’s a lifelong process for everyone. Also keep in mind THAT YOUR MIND IS TRICKING YOU. I’ve had months slogging through, feeling like nothing’s getting done, but if you keep doing even the tiniest bit, it adds up. Looking back, I’ve finished entire projects and accomplished a lot in the long term even if I feel miserable and feel like
I could have done more. Just know that no one is ever happy with their work except that those that don’t care at all. It’s having that motivation to do better and actually putting in sincere effort, even if it’s a tiny little thing, is what makes us better in the long run. Thank you, it’s taken me a while, working with a lot of different people and speaking very frankly about our different struggles to get to this point. I’ve also thought about how maybe this perspective is holding me back recently (I certainly don’t bite off more than I can chew these days!) but it keeps me healthy and that’s good enough for me right now. I didn't even find the right table😐 Don't think of medication as a sign of giving up. It's not like anti depressants where it takes a month to start working and takes trying different kinds to find one that actually works for you. ADHD meds work right away and vastly improve the lives of many ADHD people. I have heard so many success stories on here from people who are going back to university now that they are medicated! 1. Don't make the mistake of spending the rest of the day making your playlist - you have something of priority to do today
2. Once you have your playlist, you should probably stick it on an alarm because you're highly likely to avoid starting the playlist if it's likely to make you work for the next 10 hours. The struggle is real, keep going Them meds are addicting as fuck can con firm I really have. Don\`t postpone the process, go see a doctor asap. It will feel like you can finally breath again.   


Just don\`t overdo it in the beginning. Take baby steps even though you will feel like you can walk across the entire planet it a few steps. Get into the rythm and the routines =)   


I wish you the best of luck! I’m a pastry chef, and I 100% agree with the kitchen being hell with un-medicated adhd. Honestly before I was on adderall, I more than likely wouldn’t have lasted another few months. I’m fairly new (only two years in), but now that I’m on my medication, all of that attention to detail that I need is all there. And I’m kicking butt at my job, which makes me so happy (and my boss, too!). 

I won’t be in this field much longer, as I’m going to nursing school. But I’m definitely going to miss the rush.  It is a huge difference and totally worth it. Different meds affect different peoples bodies in unique ways so if something makes you feel like shit try something else and it may not! Good luck  Set a clear expectation of what needs to be done, and then take some instant release medication to ensure it gets done. I still struggle tbh. 

So much time spent looking for tools that are lost in that mess I call a van, or on another site. 

Best option is to work with others, some of my best work has been done in conjunction with others, everyone has their own strengths and know I'm shit with organisational skills.

Also, work on developing your own system. If you cannot keep to someone else's system, work to your own and work around your own problems with your own work flow. If you have the luxury of an understanding manager or are competent in your job to get away with it. 

Even something as simple as carrying ten boxes of pens/storing them locally as you always forget to bring them back from home. 


Taken up using the phone voice thing, make a reminder - list details.


Since medication my business income literally doubled.

No more long drives to discover I forgot something critical. Or double/triple booking jobs. 


A big thing is not to tell too many people about your medication, and don't make the mistake of blaming your add. I believe even timberlake has a song about it.

Adhd is a part of you, it's a frustrating thing but it's also you. And to be fair, it can be valuable to see things from a different perspective to others.


Final edit. We all screw up. It's a human thing. It can be harder to get over mistakes, and rejection dismorphia is a common trait found in adhd. Don't let the screw ups get you down, if a problem happens it can be solved.  I understand what you're saying, but you're still not getting what I'm really saying. Sometimes an ADHD adult needs to go through those experiences in the process of finding what they love. That's what happened to me. I just kept trying things until I was like, yep, that's the one. Before I discovered I have ADHD, I used to do contracting. Contracting is great for ADHD because you get twice the pay and they only hire contractors when the shit is hitting the fan. So there's tough stuff to do, and you get to be the hero.

Another major benefit of contracting is you're external to company politics so you don't have to worry about that crap or anything.

If you're staying inside the SAME company, and going for different projects, if your bosses don't know about your ADHD, I'd recommend saying to them something along the lines of:

> I've conquered everything there is to conquer here. There's nothing challenging remaining in this project. Can you please put me on the most difficult project you have? Everyone else on this project can handle support and the remaining snags.

It's how I use to explain my 'personality' pre-diagnosis. Why do you do contracting dave? Because it gives me new and tough problems to solve. Man, that would make a YUGE difference in my life. The road to being a good professional unfortunately goes straight through Journaltown. How long did it take you to find a medication regimen that worked for you? So I read this. And was flabbergasted. Then I read Hunter S Thompson’s letter on finding your purpose and living a meaningful life. And again, flabbergasted. Both articles I needed to read right now — and I bookmarked them to my phone’s home screen so I can read them again and again. Ty for the recommendation! >I feel like everyone needs a good motivation/interest in what they are doing and a little fire under their ass, people like us more than others. But that’s also what makes us insanely good when the stars align. Find out what makes you tick and what kind of work/environment makes you excel, and try to engineer your life to give you the balance that you need - it’s not easy and it’s a lifelong process for everyone.

This was a fucking excellent paragraph. Thank you. I've copied this entire thing word for word into my journal for today. Phew. Thank you. That sounds about right too 😂🙄🤦🏼‍♀️ Piggybacking on this—it often does take trying different ADHD meds until you find one/a dose that works *best.* But even before I found my correct drug/dose, my life was vastly improved from week one.

(Also definitely get a therapist in addition to medication!) I do miss the rush. I certainly miss the time of the night when the weeds are finally wacked and the only work left is the pile of dishes for the dishwashers and a general clean up / wipe down. That moment when you all look at each other and grin, giving a deep sigh that you got through another night.

I dont' miss my chef's shouting at me to pay better attention ;) Figuring out medication took about two weeks. (Remembering to schedule an appointment for the initial evaluation/diagnosis took almost two MONTHS lol)

Once I agreed to try medication, the dr prescribed a week’s worth of low dose instant release as a trial. I found it was pretty effective but only lasted about four hours before I crashed hard, so I got prescribed an extended release on top of it all so the come down is more gradual.  Yeah I guess I didn't explicitly say it but since ADHD meds work so quickly you can find the best medication for yourself much more quickly than with antidepressants! And agreed- I love my current therapist. He's actually a PhD student in training, but he's much better than my last therapist which was a pleasant surprise.
