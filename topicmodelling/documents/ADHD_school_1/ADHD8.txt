Relatable: Dear Prudence sets "unreasonable parent" straight Original: https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/10/lazy-kids-who-claim-they-have-adhd-and-more-advice-from-dear-prudence.html

>Q. Daughter on drugs: My daughter is very bright. She constantly tests in the top 10thpercentile on standardized tests and was reading at an adult level by age 9. However, she is lazy. Her grades were constantly mediocre because she just didn’t do her homework. I tried to encourage, punish, and inspire her, but nothing seemed to motivate her to just do her homework! She left for college last year, and once again, her grades, while not bad, were well below her capability. She was in danger of losing an academic scholarship that has a very strict GPA requirement, and I told her I would not pay her full tuition if she lost it. So what did she do? She got some quack doctor to diagnose her with ADHD and give her an Adderall prescription. I am beyond livid. Why can’t she just do her work?

>When I tried to discuss this with her, she blew up at me. She claims that I put undue pressure on her by never considering the possibility that she might have a learning disability. But she doesn’t! I’ve seen her sit down and read a large book from cover to cover in one sitting. She can play video games for hours. She clearly does not have an attention problem, she’s taking the easy way out by taking dangerous drugs. My husband is no help. He claims that since she brought home straight A’s last semester, we should let it slide. But I don’t want to encourage this behavior. How can I get through to her?

>A: This reads like a parody of an unreasonable parent unwittingly describing a workable solution! I’m not sure what kind of behavior you don’t want to encourage in your daughter—an increased sense of independence? Getting straight A’s? Finding a doctor who listens to her and a medication that helps her effectively manage her time and energy? Telling you long-overdue truths? Having ADHD doesn’t mean a person is incapable of reading a book or playing video games for hours, and a doctor who prescribes Adderall for a patient with ADHD is not automatically a quack. You’ve spent years trying to punish and manipulate your daughter into performing according to your exact specifications, and it doesn’t sound like that’s worked. Why don’t you take a year or two off, if only for the novelty? She’s an adult now, and she’s going to spend the rest of her life making decisions in her own best interest, whether you like them or not. I feel like this could be so many of the people here!  You're not alone if your parent(s) are unsupportive or trying to sabotage your treatment.  Remember the reasonable people out here are rooting for you. I was a parent guilty of this. My problem, like this parent, was that I had a very wrongheaded idea of what ADD was.

Fortunately for my child, I got my head on straight before my kid entered middle school. Stupid mother. “Dangerous” drugs. She must have drank the DEA kook aid. When I told my dad I was diagnosed with ADHD (at 18 years old) and was starting on medication, he just said “Be careful with that” and never talked about it again. My mom doesn’t know because she’s the type to push vitamins in cases where medication is necessary  I was once introduced to a group of people by my old maths teacher as being "the brightest and laziest pupil" she ever taught. When I was called in by my youngest son's principal to be told that there had been a staff meeting about my son - "a perennial underachiever" - the  warning bells started. Once you get lumped with a label like that by a staff body, it sticks. As another comment said, we STILL doubted it and sent him to an educational psychologist who diagnosed him as ADD-PI. We even went for a second opinion! My eldest was never given anything higher than a B by his history teacher, even when he started taking Ritalin at age 17. When he handed in his final history assignment, the teacher asked if a university student had written it for him, because he didn't believe him to be capable. Another teacher had moderated the assignment and given him a high A. How is it that educators cannot spot ADD, but would rather call a child lazy? I’m still trying to undo the years of hearing my father say “You’re lazy!”  I heard that from the time I was 5 or 6.  I’m 44 now.  

I think my parents know they were wrong now.

Girls/ladies - if you think you have ADD/ADHD, talk to a counselor, therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, or even a doctor.  We fly under the radar far too often. Jesus fucking christ. This is my mother. To this DAY.  I literally never understood how people could just sit down and do their homework. I just didn’t get it. I also had the misconception that having hyper-focus meant I didn’t have ADHD. After I was diagnosed, my boss was like, “Wait. You DIDN’T KNOW?! You’re the most obviously ADHD person ever.”

But my parents missed the memo for my entire childhood.  My teachers told my parents I'm a classic case of ADHD, but because I could spend hours building perfect Lego structures, my parents didn't believe them. I was in a gifted class when I was in grade 4, yet I was terrible at school. I barely made it through highschool. When I moved out of my house, I saw a psychologist after years of talking to my doctor. I was treated, and things have been much better. I wish I was diagnosed earlier. I want to do great things, but I'd have to do years of upgrading before I can go to a good school.  Damn, imagine how much futher kids with this kind of parent could have gone if they were given the opportunity to thrive at an early age? This is how I feel about my youth as well. Honestly I wouldn't be too surprised if my mom wrote this... She claimed that I developed ADHD as an adult/am faking it, and my dad got pissy because "ADHD drugs are dangerous for kids anyways". 

I don't care about the drugs, I just want to be accepted. Damn. Oh my god does this make my blood BOIL A lot of it also comes from the antivaxxer BS-if the kid is lazy, it’s their own fault. If the kid has a cognitive disorder, it’s genetic/biological and it could mean there’s something wrong with the parents’ precious sperm/eggs. Damn. My mom and I no longer talk about my ADHD, but there's several reasons for it, many of them stemming from a culture of not talking about mental health, but also because I'm basically a mini-me of her and she's in massive denial and has gotten this far through superhuman willpower, so I think admitting something like that about herself would do more harm than good at this point. And in spite of all this, my mother is a warm and loving person and respects my independence and is happy that I'm doing well, even if she doesn't approve of me taking medication. Also she would *never* have threatened to stop paying for my education, that is one of the shittiest things you can do as a parent for the sake of teaching your child a lesson. Fuck this bitch. That article was hard to read. ADHD or not, this parent is being an ass. Even if she does not have ADHD and is just not smart enough for the level of education her parrents tried to force on her that's not her fault. 
  Gosh I want to give whoever writes dear prudence a hug.  My high school kept refusing to give me accommodations because I was in AP classes. In their minds, a disability meant you were at the bottom of the barrel in school. I did well, but if it weren’t for my mom pushing them to give me a couple accommodations, it could’ve been a lot worse   Honestly, this sounds like my wife. I was diagnosed in middle school and for some reason decided I didn’t want to keep taking Ritalin in high school. I did pretty good anyways. 

Anyway, it much worse now. I can’t seem to get anything done. When I’ve talked with my wife about seeing a specialist again she just shuts down and won’t talk about. I’m nearly at the point where I go in anyway and just deal with the fallout later. God.  My mom refused to believe I had something wrong with me.  I got told so many times, "What's wrong with you?  I know you can do it.  I talk to one teacher and I hear what a great and attentive student you are, and I talk to another and I hear the opposite, why cant you just try for all classes?"  When 

I got diagnosed as an adult she kept trying to say, "Maybe it could be this...," and it didn't stop until finally I snapped at her, "Mom, I know it's ADD because when I'm having sex I can't have the radio or TV on because I'll start zoning into it and completely forget about the sex I'm having!"  

She just got real quite for what felt like 30 seconds and then never brought it up again.  I think the shock finally shattered her preconceptions and she could finally see it. "why not take a year or two off, if only for the novelty?" Hahahaha > I’ve seen her sit down and read a large book from cover to cover in one sitting. She can play video games for hours.

Literally describing hyperfocus, a fucking symptom of ADHD. What a clown. I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/narcsinthewild] [Relatable: Dear Prudence sets "unreasonable parent" straight](https://www.reddit.com/r/narcsinthewild/comments/9ulo56/relatable_dear_prudence_sets_unreasonable_parent/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* This makes me feel very fortunate to have parents who understand mental illness and are genuinely supportive of me working to deal with it. That lady just makes my blood boil. I love reading Dear Prudence because she always sets people like that straight. I want to send Dear Prudence flowers, now. Oh man, this might be the most satisfying verbal smack down I’ve ever seen on a dear so and so. I really hope that response finally got this parent to stop and reconsider her actions. Holy hell. INSTANT destruction. That parent is going to be pissed for the rest of their life. No parent I've ever seen has taken "you're doing your job poorly," well, no matter how true it is. Prudence should have gone a little further by explaining what ADHD is (the short version) and telling parent to take the time to actually LEARN what ADHD is.

But it is a good piece. It scares me to think of what my life would have been like and how i would have tirned out if my mom wasnt an early intervention specialist social worker. I had IEP after IEP and mom always advocated for me.

Prediagnosed at 4, diagnosed fully at 6, meds by 8. Mom encouraged me and listened when i researched and asked for adderall by 12.

 Adult adhd is manageable most days, now i have vyvanse I didn’t tell my mother about my diagnosis for almost a year and then it managed to come up. She seemed skeptical at first, even though she was diagnosed as a kid (didn’t continue being treated though). When I said I wouldn’t be surprised if my father also had it (given his habits) she was interested. 

Two weeks later I visited for dinner, and she chastised me for not eating a bunch (I was dieting) and said, “I know what the adderall is for, I’m not stupid.” I don’t know if her friends were skeptical or what. 

Thanks mom. I’m glad you think it’s more likely that I wanted to lose weight with drugs than the fact that I might have had an untreated actual issue.  This is why I don’t talk to my parents about this. They don’t know I’ve been diagnosed or that I’m on meds.  this is ridiculous. Is this real? Poor girl.  The daughter in this situation sounds a lot like me. I showed similar potential as a child/young adult but was horrible at getting my work done and my grades suffered because of it. I managed to make it through College with high grades while still undiagnosed and untreated, but only after barely scraping by for one or two semesters where I was kicked out of the honors program due to poor grades,  in large part because I couldn't manage to keep up with the amount of reading I had to do.   


While I'm more than happy with the outcome of my college experience, it was far from easy, and having been diagnosed and starting treatment at the age of 35, I really wish I could go back and do college over again. I don't think it would be any easier, but I think I could have gotten a lot more out of it.   


I'm glad this woman's daughter that she has the courage to take a stand and demand treatment in the face of external resistance. Hopefully her mother comes around at some point. This could’ve been my mom 10-15 years ago. I was always getting fussed at for being “smart but lazy” or “not working to my potential.” Matter of fact, I hate that phrase now. I wasn’t diagnosed until last year, a month before my 30th birthday. And because my mom still holds this kind of viewpoint I still haven’t told her about it and don’t plan to.  I want to hurt this parent for being so horrible :( I needed to read this today. Thanks . Reading things like this makes me so grateful that my mom was a nurse & she believed in learning disabilities!!  This is the most validating thing I've ever read and I'm taking it to therapy next week. BOOM! Tell em, Prudie! When I was diagnosed about 3-4 years ago I told my mom and she said “I know, your elementary school told me but I didn’t tell you or take you to the doctor for it because I didn’t want you to get labeled”

...oh okay... Am I the only one who just doesn't feel the need to tell their parents everything? I'm 26 and I know my mum won't understand though she loves and cares about me and I talk to her about all my self-improvements and coping strategies. I just leave out the diagnosis and medication bit! What she doesn't know won't hurt her and so won't hurt me. :D  18 years of obvious, untreated ADHD. 18 Years of guilt tripping, patronizing discussions, and a toxic environment. 

I moved overseas. I'm thriving now. I wish I could see my family as my family.  Oof. That hit close to home. So many self-esteem issues from years of broken expectations. "But you're so smart! Why don't you just apply yourself instead of being so lazy all the time?"

😞 This is scary accurate to my life. I seriously feel like one of my parents could've wrote it. Thank you.  This could be me next year. Low-key tried to tell my dad twice and all he does is.rant about the difference between hunters and gatherers and how his dad didn't think he needed it so why should he get it for me.  Back when I was in high school, my stepmom could have written the letter.  When I finally was diagnosed last year (I'm 36), she read up on it and then gave me a big hug and apology.  She's always been in my corner, but back then she just didn't know about this as a possibility. <3 I missed diagnosis by an "expert" as a teenager because I read a lot. But if something was a fantasy/horror/sci-fi novel or a video game... I couldn't pay attention if my life depended on it. I read something the other day that said "give yourself a pat on the back every time you admit you were wrong and changed your mind". Something to that effect anyway.
   
It's not always easy to change your mind. But now you can look back and say you did the right thing. My mom once told me "No way you had ADHD in high school. I mean you could sit down and play video games for hours!"

My sister in law was with us then, she was finishing her master's in childhood education with an emphasis in learning disabilities.

She chimed in "well that's actually not true. It's a really big misconception, but studies show that a lot of ADHD people also suffer from *hyperfocus* where something they find stimulating can draw them in for hours on end"

I love my mom and she's like 98% supportive of me when I talk about ADHD, but I really just wanted to high five my sister in law and drop a "in your face!"  My husband and I are both ADHD, so we have always looked for the signs in our kids. Even with 60 years of combined experience we still aren't sure if the problems our 10 year old is having is a LD or just being lazy. It's tough. But good on you for being supportive once you understood.  Thank you for recognizing this and moving forward! I'm sure your child will appreciate it with great sincerity. I can't thank my mom enough for her empathy and understanding through my struggles with ADHD. I don't blame parents for failing to recognize a disorder they don't understand. Heck, growing up even I thought I was really just lazy, because it's the only way I knew to interpret the situation and nobody ever offered an alternative view.

But when I got diagnosed by a specialist in university, my parents were fully supportive of my treatment. What really bothers me about the parent who wrote the letter is that she immediately dismissed a professional opinion as "quack" because it didn't align with her views. It's okay to question a diagnosis, but not based solely on personal opinion. I'm sure if she actually did some research into the matter she would agree with the diagnosis, as my parents did. Thanks for being big enough to admit that, and to change course before it was too late.

I'm an adult now, and it would blow me away to hear something like that from my mom. I think a lot of people in general have these misconceptions about ADHD. I wasn’t diagnosed until college and my mother was just about as supportive as the mother in this article. Luckily, as a neuroscience major, I was able to school my mother with facts and research and she eventually changed her mind. I’m glad you were able to to the same.  Do you have ADHD?  Thank you. The mother is absolutely stupid, but adderall can be dangerous. It’s a lifesaver for a lot of people, but it’s not without its risks. I took it for a couple of years and had serious side effects, which doesn’t at all mean that it’s a bad drug, just that it is dangerous. Proper and attentive monitoring by the patient, their family/friends, and their doctor is important (just like with most psychoactive drugs).  That was my dad too. He was curious how the medicine worked and just advised, “make sure you read the notes they give you at the pharmacy, there might be something important in there.”

So, measured caution. I feel like that’s a sensible approach.  I never told my parents either-they think I got "more mature"/"finally got it together." Yeah, by finally getting the treatment I need! god my mom is the same. pushed herbal adhd remedies and now that im actually on meds, constantly pushes vitamins on me. Honestly it's good to be careful with everything especially medical stuff. I mean you can die from drinking too much water so just about anything can do harm if you're not careful especially if you're not paying attention to what medical professionals tell you to do. I've told my mom that I'm on medication... but not that I'm on stimulants (vyvanse).  I started off on just wellbutrin, and my mom felt ok about that, so when I told her I switched drugs to something that was working better, I just didn't go into the details (my mom and I are pretty close - so this is actually a pretty big thing for me to keep quiet) Because teachers see the behaviors of adhd all day long every day spread across an entire student body. They are looking at too many kids to spot the indicators of actual adhd, which are effectively an entire student body worth of these behaviors in a single person.  

My wife is in education and I can tell you based on the way she and her mother talk about work, a teacher is the least empowered person in the chain to impact a kids life, and the worst positioned to spot something like a learning disability or adhd. Teachers are broadcasting a lesson plan to a large audience and hoping it sticks enough to get the kid through. They have zero time for the one on one attention required for that sort of catch. The para pros who handle the kids falling behind one on one or in small groups are the people positioned to impact individual kids, spot home problems, poverty, hunger, and of course learning disabilities and adhd. Ask your local para who the student advocate is, it’ll be one of them, they are the ones that spot this stuff and they could use help, either school supplies, or some canned food or kids jacket for the closet, maybe some wipes and some deodorant. Help the para’s and you help the unspotted adhd kids get discovered.
 It's a difficult balance to strike. We're not doctors so we can't diagnose a disorder, and, we're NOT allowed to suggest that a parent has a child tested for a disorder. If we do, it makes the school liable for the cost of the tests.

It creates a balancing act where I tell a parent that their child has a lot of trouble managing their attention and staying on task.

Also keep in mind that ADD diagnosis was demonized in the 90s as over diagnosed. In our more modern times people will still tell you, even with a diagnosis, that they just need to buckle down and work hard.

Education is like any government institution: slow and conservative.  My mum ran into my *preschool* teacher who remembered me as a kid with my head in the clouds who couldn't focus if her life depended on it. Can't believe it took me so long to figure it out.  Lol this could be about me. The first thing my fifth grade teacher said about me was that I procrastinated. I didn't even know what the word meant. In middle school most of my teachers would reject work because didn't try hard enough, and my math grades plummeted while my history grades were crazy high, all because I don't give two shits about math and couldn't focus on it. Still can't either.   Sorry what is PI?  So true. I'm 43 and just got diagnosed THIS YEAR. Same story, my parents were teachers and were constantly disappointed in me for not working to my full potential and calling me out for being lazy, and no one ever noticed my lack of focus / hyperfocus. I finally had to ask for a TOVA test and was ridiculously clearly in the "she needs meds" zone. Now I'm on Intuniv and Ritalin, going back to college and NAILING IT and all I can think is how badly I'd like a do-over for my first college experience.

There is so much guilt and shame that builds up over the years when people call you lazy, doesn't work to potential, spaced-out, ditzy, insert-your-epithet-here. You actually believe it and it takes YEARS to work it out in therapy. Me too, but it was mostly from my mother. It was hugely devastating to my self esteem for years and years and I never dared to challenge myself or make major decisions on my own because I thought I was incompetent. Therapy has helped but there's still a ways to go. Being female with a high IQ and ADHD is such a frustrating combo! We are the most under-diagnosed population for obvious reasons. I had to seek out help in college because I knew something wasn't right. I knew my combination of overachievement in some areas (specifically those that I cared about or challenged me) and poor work elsewhere wasn't caused by "laziness" or a lack of effort. I cared deeply but my brain just didn't process things appropriately. I was brilliant so teachers liked me and I could usually compensate somehow. 

I just wish I could go back in time and help my family see the truth. My mom tried to have me labelled with depression - which I did not have - and forced medication on me for that. That was horrible! Antidepressants and I do not get along. If she hadn't been fixated on that particular diagnosis I might have gotten help sooner. Yeah it sucks having to unlearn labels you were called. I know I'm not stupid now but believing something for years when you're young is really hard to fix. My therapist has told me (when I tried to bring up ADHD-PI) that I don't have ADHD and that there must be a reason that I put off doing things or haven't pursued dreams for the past 10 years and that taking drugs is "the easy way out". When I talk to other people they're like "maybe, these are all really common symptoms". I just want to be able do things and not live in disaster of a room and find a job that I actually want to do. I should probably find a new therapist, right? Or emotional, or sensitive! I'm 32, diagnosed at 14/15, and to this day I have to tell myself that it's okay to cry and be upset. My grandfather passed away last week, and I still had to stop berating myself and telling myself to calm down. Growing up, mainly my dad, but sometimes my mom, would tell me to calm down and that they wouldn't talk to me about something until I had pulled myself together. Thankfully, I have a saint for a husband that will sit with me and tell me it's okay to cry. Same.    It's why I never told my parents about my diagnosis and pay cash for psych visits/meds. Your boss seems so chill  Same though. Like, um, guys? I know I'm a girl, and therefore way under-diagnosed, but like... seriously? > You’re the most obviously ADHD person ever

is your boss my therapist? dang My (ADHD) brother and I have a long-running joke of blaming all of our problems on "them darn vaccines" and our parents ;) Dear god I relate to the mother thing. My mother never could focus on school, last minuted everything, went to university twice and had massive difficulties overall in school, yet she refuses considering if she's got ADHD. She's even saying that for years she's seen me falling into the exact same pitholes as her.

Also, my sister is exactly like me except she had a breakdown every time she does her homework and needs constant help to get it done, and she **literally** spends her entire day watching YouTube while spinning around on her chair and never sitting still. Even when we watched movies together, all her life, mom has complained that she rarely sits still Twice exceptional is a thing. Ugh. Fuck your school. [deleted] Go. Do it for your own sake. If she's worth your time, she will understand. 
Just a random stranger's opinion My other half was not fully on board with me getting diagnosed and starting treatment. He even went so far as to "forget" to get time off work for the results appointment I waited like a month for, and suggested I cancel it (I don't drive). I got a different ride and went anyway. He's much more positive now that he's had a chance to see that I haven't really changed and haven't suddenly stopped needing him.

Just go in. Maybe her hang up is rooted in insecurity or fear and she'll feel better about it after she sees the actual results of treatment.  You can send in a comment here! [https://slate.com/prudiechat](https://slate.com/prudiechat)

I just did myself :)  That’s what I did! Same here but 30 years. I moved to USA 10 years ago, but always thought I am not trying hard enough. Finally diagnosed and on medication. Also doing lot of lifestyle changes because we need more time than we estimate for even simple tasks. Like keep clothes ironed on Sunday evening for the week because I always do at the last minute before I step out of home in the morning 😀 Tell him hunters and gatherers didn’t have electricity, indoor plumbing, or access to grocery stores. Society progresses, and if everyone went “I didn’t, so why should they?” We would get no where. Alternatively, keep this in mind when he needs you to take care of him in his old age. Remember when television did or did not exist. Or better yet, tell him that most kids in the past didn’t have to take care of aging parents because they died- so why should you?  “Because you actually love me?” Admitting you were wrong is as important a life skill as it is difficult.  Yep. That was what we needed to learn. ADD doesn't mean a lack of focus; it means a lack of an ability to *direct* one's attention.

And don't even get me started on the misconceptions behind "hyperactivity." Once I understood it, explained SO much... Tldr: my mom never "believed in" mental illness until my sister then dad had pretty significant mental health issues come up. And she still didn't believe in learning disabilities until recently since her niece got diagnosed with a reading disorder and I got diagnosed with ADHD and was able to inform her of the educational background of it!

The best is that I'm currently doing my masters in elementary ed with an emphasis in learning disabilities and when I got diagnosed I had just finished the class on the basics of them, specifically the misconceptions and laws surrounding what teachers have to do regardless of those misconceptions or beliefs. 

So when my mom and aunt who are both nurses brought this up and the fact that I had nearly all As in elementary, middle, and high school but lost control of it all in college and tried to say it was laziness and lack of structure and while yea the lack of structure that come with college didn't help, they refused to admit that it could be ADHD. 

But on the flip side, my mom said my dad and I both have ADHD because we're so spacey, distractible, and forgetful, and yet doesn't effect school? 

After my diagnosis when they tried that nonsense again, even though I knew I was right and they were wrong before, I was now able to prove it and explain in detail why I was right! Afterwards I raved to my sister and she did high five me, because my sister has always supported me and I've always supported her with her depression even before my mom admitted it was a real thing also. 

My mom is coming around though, she believes in mental illness after my sister dropped out of school, quit work, and had lost 30 lbs because of her depression, and then a year after getting her help, my dad had went to Iraq for 6 months and had a PTSD-triggered episode and ended up committed to a military mental facility for a year. She doesn't question anyone's mental health anymore, now we're getting her on board with the idea that learning disabilities are just as legitimate since I have ADHD and her niece has a reading comprehension disorder. Literally every dumbass parent says this. Sorry to all dumbass parents but it's true.

Yes ADHD kids can focus on an entertaining task. What a novel idea. Guess what, tasks that are not entertaining your thinking brain gives you a kick and let's you do it. Meanwhile ADHD can really screw with that and leave us unable to do it. It's not like someone is choosing to be lazy. What you call "choosing" is literally chemicals in your brain that function and are released correctly for you and incorrectly for the ADHD person. Yeah. I wasn't. I never could grasp why my son couldn't... just... Focus!

I get it now. Even worse.

I (-C, despite I would have assumed -PI; diagnosed mid30s)  see that one of my sons has ADHD with maybe 97% probability (undiagnosed because too young -- they won't diagnise before 7, which I understand).

Even so it's hard, even impossible to act correctly. I catch myself so often doing ineffective things when trying to manage him. It's so deepl ingrained what I experienced as a parental template.

I catch myself often enough, and it is still hard to not behave exactly the same the  next time. The earlier you can get them diagnosed, the better off they will be. My 10yr old is diagnosed, as well as my 7 yr old.  Not in the slightest. That was part of the problem. Couldn't fathom why my kid couldn't *just do* the things that for me were as easy to do as walking. In retrospect, it was like criticizing a child with no ears for not being able to hear. I had trouble with adderral too. Switched to vyvanse and it wasn’t much better. I might try vyvanse again soon though.  [removed] Same! I started treatment in college after I moved out of state. I was finally able to force myself to give a damn about boring and meaningless classes (I had always excelled at challenging courses because I actually cared - which "proved" to everyone that I was fine, just lazy.) I finally became the person my family wanted me to be and they didn't ask questions. 

I went unmedicated for over 7 years while pregnant and/or breastfeeding and lived off of the coping skills I finally learned while being treated.  Erm...Not from your neck of the woods here. What's a 'para'? Some kind of teacher's assistant? Well your wife's school is not the norm everywhere. At my wife's school they changed entire focus of the science program at her suggestions, for example. 

Some teachers are a lot more in control of what can happen at school. At her school all students are also assigned a mentor teacher and in very small groups, plus one on one time, the mentors keep track of the mental health, stress, and educational achievement of each student. 

They discuss these with each other to improve educational outcomes, (where confidentiality is not more important, of course). Totally me but switch courses! Got 90's in math while failing English classes. My parents also made fun of me for failing an art class. I didn't give a shit tho. I was forced to do art classes... Primarily Inattentive I hear my own voice in my head saying it sometimes. “If you would only...” And it does this several times a day.  My therapist and I haven’t figured out how to undo this negative thinking yet.

I dropped out of college when I was about a semester and a half from finishing. And I had changed majors twice by that point.  I didn’t go back until I was 35, and again with a new major.  This time, I chose something I loved and was finally diagnosed with ADHD right before I graduated.  (Yes, I graduated.) I always wonder how I would have fared if I had medication my first collegiate go-around.  

Oh yeah, the kicker??  Now my dad says “You should go to medical school! You’re smart enough!” (I’m an RN.) I do seriously believe I could have gone to medical school and have become a doctor if I had that kind of encouragement earlier.   I’m too old to pursue it now and those med school years/residency years are brutal.

 I'm 44 and was only diagnosed last year - I'm on a combo of Brintellix and Ritalin. Waiting for Vyvanse to be registered in our country... If you have the time and inclination, please PM me with how therapy works for this, and how you rebuild yourself. Trust me, taking medication is NOT the easy way out.   You have co-pays($$), refills, med appts every 90 days, side effects, and the reminder that you have to take them in order for them to work.  I now have hypertension and trouble with grinding my teeth at night.  Sometimes I’ve had my meds held until I got my blood pressure under control.

The first psychiatrist I saw for ADHD said “the nice thing about Adderall is that it is so quick to show if it works for you or not.”  There are lots of other medications out there but I doubt anyone with ADHD is thriving on medication alone.   Having some sort of therapy or regular support group in conjunction with medication is the best combination. 

You might see if there is a therapist that specializes in ADHD in your area.    I love how "so chill" in this day and age translates to "not a complete asshole and shows basic human decency". What a time to be alive Oh damn. I never got below a C, and that low wasn’t until senior year. Hence why the school was a bitch  That's what I want to do. I'm hyperactive, and my biggest problem is impulse control. I fidgeted a lot as a kid, but I don't so much now that I'm an adult. I make quick decisions and get impatient when others are slow at something, which is problematic because my husband is inattentive :) >  ... it means a lack of an ability to direct one's attention.


Holy shit, I’ve never heard ADHD described like this, but it fits me to a T.  This. I am actively afraid of getting into new games/television shows because I can’t do things lightly. I struggle on writing emails to people, but also have read a wiki article on every skyrim npc.  Couldn't agree more! My parents never did get it.  I'm 58 now. My wife and I talk about this a lot.  Kids don't learn from what their parents say, they learn from what their parents model. Which is why I find myself badgering my son the way my dad did, even though I know That won't work... 
 Yeah it was.  Vyvanse has been a lifesaver for me, mostly because it doesn’t increase my desire for stimulants. When I took adderall, I wanted to drink a bunch of coffee and chain smoke all day long. I was also not very fun to be around- basically like someone on coke. With vyvanse, I was able to quit smoking, and I drink a normal amount of coffee. I behave like myself and don’t actively enjoy taking it, which I did with adderall, so that’s a lot less worrying. 

That said, vyvanse isn’t *that* different from adderall. If I hadn’t quit smoking, I don’t know that it would be as effective for me as it is.  Try Ritalin if you haven't. I fought with Adderall and drugs similar to it for years, thinking I'd just have to live with the miserable side effects. Someone here suggested Ritalin and it doesn't have any bad side effects for me at all. Stimulants like Adderall, Vivance, Ritalin, etc. are not “medical meth” just because they are amphetamines, although medical/prescription meth exists and [can be prescribed](https://www.rxlist.com/desoxyn-drug.htm) for *treatment resistant* ADHD, among other disorders. If you want to compare Adderall, etc. to a street drug, “medical speed” would be more accurate. 

There is enough stigma and misinformation already floating around (not to mention some general hysteria) about ADHD and the prescription treatments for attention disorders without people casually referring to them as “medical meth”. 

That being said, I think it’s important for an individual (or a parent, in the case of minors) to monitor the effects of any drug that works by altering the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and to be on the lookout for any adverse side effects that these drugs may have on an individual. 
 “Paraprofessional is a job title given to persons in various occupational fields, such as education, healthcare, engineering, and law, who are trained to assist professionals but do not themselves have professional licensure.” Paraprofessional, teachers aide/assistant, instructional aide/assistant .. they're all the same thing in most cases! Thats good to hear! it breaks my heart to see what these kids are dealing with around here.  I am a nurse as well. I actually started pre-med in college and switched to nursing before I got treatment as well. My family gave me a really hard time about the switch (medical family) and the guilt still haunts me. But I am finishing up my MSN/MBA with plans for a PhD after that! It doesn’t matter if you could’ve been a doctor. Nurses are important and needed and a good career choice. Glad you chose it! Constant reinforcement that you ARE okay.  Sometimes, something a therapist says (a good one at least) will click in your head and resonate for a long time.

Sorry, you didn't ask me, did you? [Cognitive behavioural therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) , or CBT - literally retraining your brain to think a different way. It encourages you to pay attention to every thought that goes through your head and "reframe". It felt like total bullshit at first, I was pretty resistant to it but suddenly one day I noticed how vicious my internal monologue was. Sometimes it can feel a bit like arguing with yourself haha but this is by far the best tool I've been given to help with my various mental health issues (dysthymia, GAD, cPTSD and ADHD, for reference). Although I'm not entirely sure I understand "hyperactivity" right, either. People seemed to relate when I explained it like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9o2t6x/my_three_month_report_of_being_on_medication/e7r5e5t/)

EDIT.  

People with ADHD make decisions very differently than others.

We tend to make decisions concerning wether we will do something or not based on:
* 1) is it interesting?
* 2) is it fun?
* 3) does it NEED to be done right now? (as in last minute realisation that it is due )

So we can always play for hours :P
 Poor regulation That's different from me. I used to chain smoke and have 32+ ounces of redbull every day.

While on my meds I still smoke, but not as much and I drink an 8 or 12 ounce can every day. Weirdly enough, I stopped drinking when I started stimulants, even though it’s a depressant. I went from 2-3 glasses of wine a night (a lot for a small woman!) to nothing overnight. I realized it about 3 days later. I went from being crabby about not having a drink to not even noticing I hadn’t had anything. It was odd. 

But it was becoming a problem, and my family has a long history of alcoholism. Stimulants may very well have saved my life from going down the same path.  I will try it  My bad there, ive just been told from a friend who got his medicine that it was like a medical meth. Didnt mean to try and further the stigma. *Thank you*. Ugh. Without my meds I am basically incapable of holding down a job. I don't need people casting me as a damn drug addict and so many people do.  Apparently I didn't, but thanks for the answers!

If you want to wax lyrical with examples and lavish details, my inbox awaits! **Cognitive behavioral therapy**

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psycho-social intervention that aims to improve mental health. CBT focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors, improving emotional regulation, and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. Originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its use has been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety.The CBT model is based on the combination of the basic principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology.

Yup, this is my life. My brain does this neat little trick where it just blocks out any task that I really don’t want to do. I just completely forget that it needs to be done, even if I woke up that morning determined to at least do that one thing. x10 without meds. I tried to keep everything written down in a notebook, and I did well for a few months, but eventually I started to forget to check it or add to my to-do lists, and now I think it’s on my desk buried under a pile of mail. Basically, my ability to rationalize procrastinating is unparalleled. 

About the comment you linked to, it’s funny, because I was browsing r/ADHD a few months back, and in one thread people were talking about songs getting stuck in your head, which led to people saying that they always had something going on in their heads, whether it be a song or an inner monologue or whatever. And I was like, “Uh, that’s not normal???” Because I’ve always been like that. My head is never quiet. It doesn’t bother me, probably because I’m used to it, but I can definitely see how it would make it hard to stay focused.

 Care to elaborate? No worries :) I probably came down a little hard on you this morning. My coffee hadn’t kicked in yet.  I didn't ever feel that it was overwhelming or that anything was wrong with it.  If fact i would say I relished being able to track so many things going on at once.

The downside took MANY years (diagnosed at 49) for me to start to feel overwhelmed and defeated (although still functioning well) to a point of resignation about life.  This  was caused by my coping mechanism, which while worked very well to help me function fairly decently, it definitely was taking its toll on my psyche and my happiness.

Now my boardroom has about 6-10 people in it and they wait their turn to speak.  Which leads me to not getting to them till too late, and missing things.... but life is a learning project and I am still learning how to be happy AND do things :) Its all good my man, though honestly i just cant imagine what effect adderal has and other medicines like them.
