I had my first university exam two months ago. Today I got my grade This is my second attempt at university.
The first one failed horribly due to undiagnosed ADHD and a heavy depression because of it.
Always failing to meet your own expectations takes a toll on your mental health...
After getting therapy, meds and ADHD training I wanted to prove to myself that I am not a failure and can do it.
So I enrolled in university a second time.
I noticed a huuuge difference compared to the last time at university, still in was very nervous for the exam.
That grade would determine whether or not everything was worth it.


And it was.
I got a B.
I am beyond happy and wanted to share it with you guys :)  Congrats!!  So happy for you!! Congrats on your personal success! I totally understand where you have come from. I have been trying to complete college off and on for 15 years. I have two terms left and am so excited! Make sure to meet with the disability services department if you haven't already. This and finding a planning system for me have made a world of difference. Meds help too! Keep up the great work! Internet stranger believes in you! That is fantastic news! I’m on a multiple attempt also. Unfortunately due to economic circumstances I always have to do school and work simultaneously. As I’ve gone along I’ve added birthing my babies in there as well. It frustrates me to no end that I’m actually a success in life ( ie gainfully employed , currently pose no immediate threat to self or others ;-)) But SCHOOL!!! Argghh. Diagnosed- medicated - adhd coach in place, accommodations all set up. Still . . . Can’t. . . Do . . . it. But I push on. I love the good news stories. Keep em coming. It motivates us all! 😊👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Fuck yeah, bud!!  ust failed out. currently getting therapy for the terrible depression my adhd and school contributed to. i was always going to go back but i was scared i wasn’t gunna be able to do. you’ve given me hope my friend thank you University can be particularly difficult for those of us with various attention disorders, but an advantage of my ADHD, I have found, is that the psychological reward of meeting goals is all the better :) congrats on taking another stab at it OP! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Wow that's amazing congrats ! Same thing happened for me... First year in Uni was a failure, almost got expelled even though I passed all my classes. My grades were just not good enough. I met the rector and told him about my situation, which included me starting my meds this semester. I now have grades from B to A- in all my classes :) It's not even like cheating and becoming smarter, it's about the fact that I can finally focus in class and while studying, which feels so good. Congrats! This is great news! I finished my Masters and Bachelors and would like to offer some advice. Half way through my Masters, I had a huge case of "burn-out". I was so done with school and craved to have a personal life outside of school. 

My now husband, (then boyfriend) saw that I was struggling and in a supportive way, helped me break down my school load in my head so it wouldn't be so overwhelming. Any time I got an assignment back and it needed to be resubmitted, my bf was there to go through it with me and help me focus on the parts that didn't satisfy the requirement. This organized approach saved me a lot of heartache and further burnout. He was always encouraging and supportive and reminded me how close I was to graduating every time I wanted to just push another semester. 

It’s imperative to have someone that holds you accountable and talks you off the ledge when you're feeling overwhelmed. You should also try to create a schedule of designated study/homework time and free activity time. The more breaks you take to burn off energy or clear your mind, will help you focus when it’s time to study. I recommend for every hour of work, half hour of free time. 

Finally, take sticky notes and write the reasons on them why you are going to school and what it would mean to graduate. Stick those sticky notes to your bathroom mirror and read them when you're not feeling motivated to finish an assignment. I hope this helps. This gives me a lot of hope. Right now Im having a lot of trouble with college due to depression, anxiety, and untreated ADHD. Hearing that someone made it out on the other side feels great to hear. I’m really happy for you and hope you’re improvement continues:) Keep it up! You're doing fantastic!

I struggled with ADHD all throughout college but hey, now I'm a professor who 'struggles' with ADHD :) Definitely chat with the University's accessibility office if you haven't. Best of luck with your path of ADHD management; it sounds like you are doing a GREAT job with it! Hey man that's awesome. Congrats! I'm just another person about drop out of university because of depression and ADHD. Good to know at least one of us can make it   Congrats!!
As a side note, HOLY SHIT it took your professor 2 MONTHS to grade your exam?!?!? Why didn’t you do better?  

You’re just lazy.

Doesn’t it feel great to not have to hear those two things anymore?  Good for you!  Congrats.
 Congratulations! Hard work pays off! Stay strong! You got this💪🏻🙏🏻 Congratulations!!! Keep up the good work!!! Congrats! That's great to hear! Congratulations! One small question though, what do you mean by adhd training?  I’m happy for you!!! I’m in the same situation 🎉🎉 Well done! 

Victory! That's solid! I'm happy for you. That's awesome! Congrats! Undiagnosed ADHD in college is super tough! Keep the momentum going! Congrats!!!

Its all about following a plan and seeing it through! (for me at least!)

Cheers to many, many more passing grades!!  Thanks for sharing! Congratulations!! I failed university for the same reasons you did the first time, it's great to see a success story!  🎉 Woohoo!!! 🎉 <3 <3 <3

We're all gonna make it bros Congratulations!   Glad to hear! Keep it up and make all ADHD people proud! congratulations! Congratulations! Im really happy for you!  Congratulations!!! I am in the same situation.
Trying University the second time. 
But your grade gave me hope and motivation :-) I'm glad I read this, I'm still waiting to hear back on if my university will let me back in after I failed for very similar reasons. I think the answer comes next week and I just have this gnawing thought st the back of my head that im gonna repeat the same mistakes, despite all of the progress I've made...  Congrats! How long was your first attempt? I dropped out four years ago after trying for 6 years. I might consider going to university again but start over when I move to the US. You’re giving me hope! Dude congratulations!! You inspire me. I tried community college 3 times (before diagnosed and treatment) and I’m considering going back. Thank you for sharing, and keep rocking the year!  how long did you take between each go? I've done poorly twice so far and I'm super discouraged, and my depression is out of control, and I'd need to make some changes to myself but I really want to know if it's something that took a long time or not.
congrats by the way  Congratulations I'm glad you had enough faith in yourself to try again! Keep going you can do it. Failure is just a stepping stone lesson to eventual success I know exactly what that is like. Congrats on getting through it, and even more importantly getting back to school. You're off to a great start. Congrats!   Have you gotten ADA accommodations for your exams?   I'm definitely going to get exam accommodations for my upcoming third attempt at higher education, now that finally I'm diagnosed and treated. My wholehearted congratulations! I got therapy and treatment, I just never went back. I’m proud of you for giving it another go. Nice.

But it took 2 months to get an exam grade back? Holy fuck.  I’m curious what specific ADHD training you had. Do you mean you went to a coach or something else? >	Always failing to meet your own expectations takes a toll on your mental health.

This sums me up perfectly and I’ve never heard it crystallized so well. I’ve always struggled to define what causes my depression but this is it. Even now that I’m medicated for ADHD and depression this still gets to me.

Huge congrats to you though man. Getting treatment made a huge difference for me in terms of productivity in grad school. Yay! Great job! Thanks for the inspiration. CONGRATULATIONS! So stoked for you! You worked hard and you earned an awesome result! Yes!! But even better is that you have within you the courage and persistence to try again. 

It's never about falling, it's about getting up again. 

Go you! May you make a great career for yourself.  I'm glad it went well for you! Congrats on your grade! 🤗 don't be too hard on yourself! So proud! I have had similar success recently because I have all As this semester and have brought my GPA up from a 2.8 to a 3.1 thanks to getting all Bs last year! Your awesome keep at it. Im on my second attempt at university. And geetting ready to graduate soon. Tookme a littlewhile but im gonna do it damnit. Understand the struggle. I seem to cope with Uni in terms of passing, but I find it really hard to focus when working on assignments and usually begin them 3 days before they’re due. I’m worse at work I fluff around most of the day my mind wonders.

Undiagnosed ADHD (I have an appt in Jan) so hoping to get it sorted out (if I actually have it, seems likely).

I managed to pull a Credit (65/100) and Distinction (72/100) out of my ass somehow overall for the unit, so I was super happy I almost cried with excitement. It felt very downhill so I must have aced the exam. Congrats!  My man(or gal) 🙏 My grades ranged from Passes (4) to high distinction (7) without any rhyme or reason.

University made no sense to me. Same amount of effort for each class - different outcome. Way to go!   Wow, congratulations! Keep persevering--this is evidence that you were meant to succeed! So proud of you!!!!! You did it!!!!  Nice! It took your instructor 2 months to grade your first exam?  Maybe they have ADHD too. So stoked for you! And thanks for the reminder that this doesn’t need to be a sentence to underachieving! CONGRATULATIONS!!! A lot of people don't understood just how big of an achievement something like this. I was in a similar boat to you, I dropped out once and failed my second attempt at college (both were before I was diagnosed.) Just getting into second year is a huge achievement, and a B is a really good grade. Well done again!! Congrats champ! I could relate to the feeling of having ADHD + depression in University it sucks, I ended up leaving for similar reasons. Hope your 2nd chance is going great! Holy crap dude! The trials of life are many, but you're knocking then down like they're nothing! Good on you b! On a side note, I've heard that raw milk also helps with ADHD (I don't have ADHD, so I can't say if it works or not, but I do enjoy raw milk regardless lol)! I'm not sure if it does or not, but just wanted to let you know! Once again dude, your making great strides that most would be jealous of! Congrats! 🎉🎊🎉 [deleted] Wow, your endurance is awesome! I am sure you will ace your last two terms, kind internet stranger ❤️!
I already met with the disability service department of my uni. I have been given extra time and they were not that hard on my spelling (thank God for that).
 I want to give you a hug right now. I have been waking up sweating with anxiety about University, as this is my third attempt now. Being 21 and still doing entry level subjects with 18 and even 17 year olds and seeing your friends from school graduating is a horrible feeling.  I haven't been on meds since high school, which really helped me get through my final exams with marks that got me into the uni I wanted, and stopped soon after because it was effecting my social life. However, I've lately been reconsidering the idea of ritalin or even a non-stimulant medication as the depression and anxiety of feeling like a failure 24/7 has caused me to be even more reclusive than ritalin did. Sorry for rambling, but this is the first thing I saw this morning after a horrible night of not sleeping, thinking about this exact topic and knowing other people have experienced something similar almost brought a bloody tear to my eye, I tell ya. Thank you for this. I sooooooooooo know that feeling! I am working too, but thankfully it's a job where I am allowed to learn if there is nothing to do.
I am sure sooner or later you will finish school too, I believe in you ❤️❤️❤️ I know that feeling, it is really horrible. I had to go to a mental hospital (is that what it called in English?) for 4 month before I had enough strength to go on. 
But I know that it will get better ❤️ once You get your depression under control and your ADHD too things will become so much better and you will start to see that you CAN do it after all.
You can massage me anytime if you want, I will help you ❤️❤️❤️ oh my god, I'm almost in exactly the same boat. it's not a pleasant boat to be in, but this is so comforting to know that I'm not the only one. It's hard to think or remember it, but I think we gotta remember that life is playing a long game, especially for the likes of us, so we can't rush it or be super afraid of it.  you've made my shitty day feel a little better, feeling like I'm not a lost cause.  Oh yes, being able to read for longer than 5 minutes... Now learning became fun!  Your husband sounds amazing, you are so lucky to have him!
For me it's my little sister. We live together and she pushes me everyday to do my best and gets angry with me when I don't do enough or start to trail off.
I also write down every important deadline or what ever, not only in my calendar that I put on my front door so I see it every day, but Also in my mobile phone and my laptop!

I do the same thing with my breaks. But I make it a point to do the break in a completely different room than the one I learn in. Either I go an a walk or in the living room (I learn in the dining room where I have a desk).
For me it's important to separate learning time and free time.

The sticky notes sounds awesome, I will try that immediately!  Thank you so much!
I am sure you will be able to get through it too!
Best thing is to get your ADHD diagnosed, once you get it under control your depression will become better too! At least that's how it was with me.
I believe in you ❤️❤️❤️
 Dropping out isn't the end of the world.  I dropped out too my first time around. I went back in my thirties, graduated with my bachelor's cum laude, then got an assistantship (got paid to go to grad school and free tuition).  Graduated with my masters, and have been promoted twice in the 3 years since.  Meds make a huge difference. (Note that my experience is by no means typical, just saying what's possible) I am sure you can make it too! Just get your mental health under control first.
It doesn't matter if you make it today or in thirty years, life is too short to be angry at not being 100% when 85 % is pretty darn good too  in the same boat, but you can't give up, if you take time to rehab yourself and get shit in a line, and exhaust every possible resource, the chances are so much higher a second or third time around  Yeah, the new semester already started without me knowing if I passed or not.
I have been on edge the whole time!  A local psychiatry is specialized on ADHS. They offer "classes " or "training" on ADHS, like what's is it, what does it do, what other illnesses can be caused by it, what does each medicine do, how does it affect your social life, what can you do to get it under control, what benefits does it give you, etc etc etc.
It's super interesting and it helped me to understand ADHD better and also took away a lot of the fear, doubt and any other negative feelings I had towards it!  I am sure you will rock it😄👍
The second time is easier XD I am sure you will rock it😄👍
The second time is easier XD Good luck! Positive thoughts going your way!  I am thinking of you and I am sure you will rock it!
I believe in you, if I can do it, you can too ❤️ My first try was also 6 years, tho I stopped attending classes after 5.
During the whole time at university I maybe attended 20-25 classes? After the 3 year I started to fall deeper and deeper into a hole and it took me a lot of time to get back out.
The good thing is, now that I failed once I know what NOT to do 😅
I am sure you will make it if you try again ❤️ don't do it here, the debt is insane  I think it was about three years? During the first year I just kinda try to act like nothing was wrong and looked for work I could do without university.
During the second year I found a place where I could work long time, before it was just 3-6 months for each job, but after I signed the contract and got in to my car I suddenly cried non stop for at least one hour because I was just so unhappy. That was the moment I decided I had to do something. I went back in, said I couldn't do it after all, drove to my doc and got help.
This year, after therapy and with help of my little sister, I worked up enough courage to try again.

So yes, it took a long time, and maybe it takes even longer for you.
But that is OK too! It's better to fail three times and take 10 years or what ever but then do it while feeling good about yourself than trying and trying and forcing yourself but failing and being unhappy again.

You don't have to do anything 100 % perfect. 85% is pretty good too!  Yeah I got more time and they weren't as strict on the spelling. Both helped me a lot, because I didn't need to rush so much and could do it my own pace, even if that meant that I stared at the wall for 30 minutes lol There is a huge psychology hospital where I live and it is specialized on ADHD. They offer classes or training on ADHD. There you learn everything about ADHD you need to know, like what neurological effect it has on your brain, what each medicine does, how ADHD impacts your social life, what other illnesses can be caused by ADHD, what benefits ADHD can have and how to deal with it in general.
It was super interesting and very helpful!  I think so too 😂 I just hope it doesn't Take so long this semester as well  Thank you 😄😄
I never tried raw milk and I am not sure if it is sold where I live 🤔... My country is kinda strict with food safety and stuff.
But I noticed that drinking a lot in general helps me... I think.  But well, drinking enough is never wrong 😄 I took two years off and helped manage a craft brewery- it was soooo helpful. I’m back in college now with proper treatment and support and it’s so much better. As long as you keep lookin for opportunities and are willing to take the plunge and go again it’s worth it in my opinion  This sounds like me two years ago. I was having a rough time with my sleep disorder (bless my brain) and ended up dropping out due to health issues. I took the summer off and went back in fall. The entire time my most important asset was my husband...but my second most important was my therapist. 

Seeing a therapist really helped me realize during the hard times what I was doing to myself to worsen my own predicament without realizing it. We worked through self talk. We worked on identifying anxiety. It was a godsend. Once I went back I was in a better place...and have been since.

I don't have the best grades...gpa is 2.68. But as a favorite classmate said...C's get degrees. I have retaken several classes...one of which I am in for the third time. You just have to remind yourself that this is something you are doing to improve yourself and your loved ones. 

Side note...recently I admitted to myself I have a phobia of paper since I am so horrible at time estimation. I invested in a rocketbook and it has been life changing. It is basically a quick-erase smart notebook. I have the everlast which just wipes clean with a damp cloth. I like that I can plan my "ideal" and snap it to evernote and then if I fail to meet it...i can write another...no waste. 

Side note 2...I am terribly behind this term and it happens every term. I am a horrible procrastinator. But...i speak to my advisors and am open and honest about what I deal with. This has helped a lot on top of having disability services involved.  Acing is a bit positive and unrealistic haha. As long as I get C's I am happy. I gave up on the perfection grades a long time ago because otherwise I wouldn't have made it this far. Make sure to check out the reply I just did to another comment. More useful info if you want. You are welcome. I was in your shoes once. And back then Reddit was not a thing lol. I am 34 and wish I got things figured out sooner but oh well! That is life! Luckily there isn't a right or wrong way to live it. Just gotta do your best. I am happy to help! When I first discovered this subreddit I cried a lot because I had no idea I had ADHD. I was 30. I was in school and struggling. I just happen to be doing better and have meds that work...okay enough. Not perfect...but I don't think there is a perfect solution. :’-) Thank you. It's been particularly rough lately. I'll do my best! Havent come across anything like that where I live, didnt even know that existed! Thanks! I hope so 😉 Yes I totally know what you mean! I also suffered from anxiety which masked my ADHD and stalled my diagnosis for so long. I couldn’t attend a lot of the time because I was so ashamed that I didn’t finish most of my assignments. Even though I was one of the smartest students. Now that I finally know what’s been wrong the whole time, I wanna try again! Maybe even study psychology. Medication has made such a difference. 

Good luck!! Keep it up! I don’t want to do it in Egypt where I live right now AND I don’t want to be stuck here for another 4 years. If I want a decent university, I’d have to transfer to AUC which will get me in debt anyway.  Thank you :) No problem b! Tbh we had to get raw milk from an Amish community! They sold it to us for our "pet's consumption" buuuuut you know we enjoyed it ourselves lol! 😂 I will check it out, thank you 😄 I believe in you ❤️ feel free to massage me anytime you need some help or someone to vent to
