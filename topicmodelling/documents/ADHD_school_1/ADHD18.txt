How I Got Better: 10 BRIEF Tips From an ADHD Vet. On Improving Your Life (Easy Read) 1. **Don’t Beat Yourself Up So Much.**
Each day is a unique struggle for people like us. 

2. **Learn Your Side Of The Spectrum.**
Understanding our unique ADHD struggles helps us be more forgiving when we screw up. 

3. **Communicating “You” Better.** 
Significant others don’t understand “_Sorry, that’s just my ADHD._” Learn your quirks, get comfortable reflecting on the way your brain works, and be detailed in explaining them to partners/people who need to know. 

4. **Disconnect/Unplug.**
Commit to an hour of quiet a day. We need to decompress, and doing so regularly will greatly help with anxiety.

5. **Write It Down.** 
Just do it, you will forget. 

6.  **Food/Water.**
Don’t take meds on an empty stomach. Set alarms for next meal/hydration, you will forget. 

7. **Exercise.**
Don’t discount the anxiety reducing effects of physical activity. Make it a regular habit, you WILL feel better. 

8. **No One Understands.**
Your ADHD struggle is your own, don’t expect sympathy or extra help. Ask for it when you need it, and take responsibility of managing YOUR disability. You’re in control. You can be better.

9. **Your Disability Isn’t A Social Topic.** 
Unless expressly necessary, keep it to yourself. ADHD still carries a stigma and is wildly misunderstood, don’t let friends/extended fam/coworkers label you based on their misunderstanding of ADHD. 

10. **Breathe.**
This doesn’t go away or get better, we just get better at managing it. Happy Sunday, I’m gunna get back to cleaning the kitchen now. 







**Bonus For The Interested**
I’m 25, diagnosed at 17, medicated since. I used to get really frustrated at the world for not understanding me. Teen years were extremely rough. I couldn’t articulate what was wrong with me. Once I was diagnosed, I wore the badge of “I’m fucked up” for a really long time. That was my excuse for everything. I gave myself and everyone I knew that excuse and expected the world to accommodate. 

Please. For the love of god. Do not make this same mistake. The world doesn’t give a _shittttttt_ that you’re mentally disabled. Learning that early will help you accept that taking control of your disability is all you can do to improve your situation. We are responsible for getting better. Support systems are great, but life throws curveballs and support systems fail. The only one who can ever possibly fully understand you, is you. 

Reflect. 
Evaluate. 
React.
Repeat.

Ok now I’m seriously going to get going on those dishes. 

 Shouldn’t we share our stories about ADHD to remove stigma around it? Something worth mentioning is that if someone is talking about adhd in a misinformed manner and you feel like it can be a teachable moment you can still speak up about it without saying you're adhd if that's a concern. It really comes down to reading the setting and people but it's totally worth it if they'd be open to discussion. You could say you had/have a family member or friend with the condition and go from there. 

Personally I don't bring up my adhd unless it naturally comes up in conversation, normally with close friends, but I'm always open about it to people if they're curious.  i saved this post to read it later... we all know how that ends dont we Holy shit I needed this.

I posted earlier today after it hit me how much my ADHD actually affects me. Sure I'm forgetful and struggle to focus, but there's so much more I attributed to 'personality quirks'. I've been browsing this sub at work for a few days now and it's been interesting, but I hand't connected any of the interesting 'dude same' moments to the fact that it's **because** I have ADHD that I agree.

The post got removed because I didn't read the rules before posting. I haven't reposted because I lack the energy and motivation for it. This really reaffirmed in my mind that I'm not the only one who struggles.

Thank you. I have ADD and sometimes I forget to take my meds in the morning, so I have some at school, one day during 3rd period, I realized I hadn’t taken my meds. So I went to the nurse and she had to call my mom, since she didn’t say I needed them, and my mom said. “If she came to you and said she forgot, she probably did.” Last paragraph remind sme of what I said in another post

>Regardless of how you feel about it, **adhd isn't a choice.** I feel like thinking about the negatives are just a waste of time at this point. Its a disability, yeah, but we don't get any brownie points in life for it. We still gotta carve our own path. Letting my adhd bring me down got in the way of that and led me dark places. Now I focus solely on the strengths it provides me, and that's proven the best decision I've made in my life. You’re so kind! Thank you so much for this! :)  Thank you, I needed this today. 10/10 for the clickbait title. Genius.

So true about self-awareness and how we have to cultivate it. Why shouldn’t you take meds on an empty stomach? I’m kinda new to medication and when I asked they said taking it with food is no different except it kicks in slower Did your high school know about your ADHD? Just wondering because I'm struggling with this rn I know this sounds horrible but it makes me really upset that adhd is a mental disability.. makes me feel really bad. How can i get over this? I love Number 1 is Number 1. It is the HARDEST thing for me to remember and the most often repeated piece of advice I have been given. Be kind to you. Forgive yourself. And just remember to try harder and be better tomorrow. For someone who is only 25, you have obviously come a long way.  It is a very mature and admirable perspective and understanding on something that can be debilitating to many.  Congratulations and don't stop learning more about yourself. That you so much for making this bullet points, I just spent 15 minutes trying to read a similar post that was just one big text Thanks for posting this, I've been diagnosed for 7 years now but I still struggle. Bit of a side note though, I saw the title and thought it was pet-related cause of the word 'vet'  Great article, thank you! You might want to remove the "mentally disabled" mention on your second to last paragraph ; ADHD as I'm sure you know is not a mental illness, but a learning disability.

So, I expect the dishes are done by now?  > you’re mentally disabled

I still grimace a bit hearing/reading this. I get that for some of us here, the symptoms are so overwhelming that functioning day to day is difficult, but I've personally never felt disabled... It just feels like a weird label to have and triggers some imposter syndrome, like maybe I was misdiagnosed or something. Yes and no. Here on this subreddit where you’re anonymous? Of course. To the ones who you are close with and trust, yes. Sharing your experiences will broaden their view of ADHD. That alone will begin to curve the stigma. 

But to anyone else, it’s not worth it. Don’t post about your ADHD moments on social media, don’t share it with employers (unless your condition is debilitating enough to warrant it), & don’t tell anyone who isn’t of significant importance to you. No matter what you say online or to these people, their view will always trump your experiences. 

Is the world becoming more accommodating and understanding? Sure, but slowly. We will be walking a tight rope on the subject for a very long time. We just have to be cautious.  100% this. Thanks for adding that. Nothing sets us back more than misinformation being spread. But yes, as always, read the situation.  At least do #5 right now. Thanks for reading! :)  It’s a lifelong struggle but that’s okay. At least here, we’re all in it together.  I know my people lol. But the intentions were good, I just hope I helped someone today.  I like to take it immediately before eating. Stimulants are an appetite suppressant, and you have to eat. If you don't eat, the stimulant wears off eventually, and that hangry feeling you would have been experiencing suddenly arrives at the same time that you come off the stimulant. It's like getting a double dose of "fuck-everything-damnit."  At least have lots of water if you can't have food. As well as being a appetite suppressant on a empty stomach it can sometimes give you a bit of a head spin or stomach ache if it comes on quickly  My high school did not, but my teachers reached out to my parents essentially saying “something is wrong” repeatedly as a struggled in hs. I was a junior when I finally got diagnosed.

My parents are very traditional people. Work hard, don’t complain, earn it type people. They loathed my laziness. Blamed me for my own lack of success in school. I finally got them to take me in for an evaluation and it took the psychiatrist all of an hour to tell them I should have been medicated years ago. 

What I didn’t realize is that if I had said something to the school, they could have given me assistance in my classes. Lots of schools will offer extended test times, quiet test rooms, extensions on work, etc. If you are young and struggling with ADHD (or what you might think is ADHD) 100% let the school you’re attending know and ask how they can help you. 

Hang in there & good luck! Think of all the medical diagnoses there are out there. There is COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), for example, that doesn't define the person as who they are but explains they might need special considerations. There are rescue inhalers, maintenance inhalers, and other medications they depend on, for example, but don't HAVE to use. They can choose to not use meds, have a poor quality of life, not be able to breathe, and/or die. My long-winded point?  It's a chronic disorder we have that we can choose to treat with medication and therapy or we can not. We too will have a poorer outlook trying to manage alone and miss out on life's greater things. Our ADHD isn't going away and our brains are just different. It's only an "illness" if we ignore it and allow it to take over. Otherwise, we have the power to do our best to overcome these challenges. Somedays we'll lose but most days we'll win, but we mustn't dwell on the bad and forget all the good days. This is my peace I've made with my brain. My brain is atypical but it is mine.  I appreciate that. I just hope my experiences can help others. And of course — always learning, always growing. Have a great day!  ADHD is not a learning disability, it's a neurodevelopmental disorder. Yes! The dishes have been completed. I made sure to put my phone in my room to get it done lol. 

I appreciate the input on that. I actually chose to use that specific phrase instead of learning disability. In my opinion, ADHD extends far beyond just “learning.” In fact, I’d equate the inability to function cognitively across many executive functions to be just that, a mental disability. 

Now of course I’m not a psychologist or psychiatrist and that line of thinking may be entirely my own — but as an adult with ADHD, I can tell you at times my lack of functional cognitive ability sure seems like a mental disability in its own respect. Learning is 100% at the forefront of the disorder, but there is just so much more to it.

Moreover, the term “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder” is practically archaic at this point. We’ve been in need of a rebrand for a long long time, something that more accurately describes the broader spectrum of “ADHD.” **tl;dr - No disenfranchised group has ever enacted meaningful change by staying hidden. The stigma and shittiness will continue until more people with ADHD stand up against it. It's fine if you don't want to take that risk, but telling others to do the same only sets us back as a group.**

>Yes and no. Here on this subreddit where you’re anonymous? Of course. To the ones who you are close with and trust, yes. Sharing your experiences will broaden their view of ADHD. That alone will begin to curve the stigma.  
  
With all due respect, fuck that. This type of slacktivist approach is exactly why the stigma against ADHD has remained largely unchanged for so long. People with ADHD have been sharing their experiences with close friends and family for decades now, and it's failed to "curve the stigma" in any appreciable way.  
  
The reason why it has failed and will continue to fail is simple: people are intellectually lazy. When someone's views (e.g. ADHD stigma) are challenged by only a handful of counterexamples (e.g. knowing a few people with ADHD) at most, they are substantially more inclined to treat those examples as exceptions to the rule than to revise their views around them.  
  
This reality is baldly apparent when you look at the history of pretty much any social movement ever. Women are 50% of the fucking population, literally crucial to the survival of our species, and even *they* had to make a stand to get the rights and respect they deserved. If talking to close friends and family didn't work for a group that includes literally half of all people, why would it work for a minority group? The answer is that it wouldn't, hence why every minority group has had to fight for their rights and respect too.   
  
>But to anyone else, it’s not worth it. Don’t post about your ADHD moments on social media, don’t share it with employers (unless your condition is debilitating enough to warrant it), & don’t tell anyone who isn’t of significant importance to you.  
  
Everyone should weigh the costs and benefits for themselves. You know what's not worth it to me? Feeling like I have to live a lie, to hide my condition like I'm a goddamn werewolf, to stay silent when bigoted idiots talk shit about people with a neurodevelopmental disorder.  
  
There's certainly something to be said for tact and for knowing when to pick your battles. However, there's a vast middle ground between complete transparency and total secrecy. It's not a single binary choice, it's a bunch of sliding scales.  
  
>No matter what you say online or to these people, their view will always trump your experiences.  
  
It's funny that you see this as a reason to stay quiet, because I see it as a reason to speak up.  It actually fits in perfectly with one of my earlier points. People only do this *because* nobody speaks up, which means their bogus views are rarely challenged. As such it's easier for them to write you off as an exception than to change their views. If people were constantly speaking up against their views then they might actually reconsider them.  
  
>Is the world becoming more accommodating and understanding? Sure, but slowly. We will be walking a tight rope on the subject for a very long time. We just have to be cautious.  
  
At this rate we'll all be dead in the ground before the general population sees ADHD as more than "oh look a squirrel!" The reason the world is becoming more understanding is because more of us are standing up. It would go faster if people would stop encouraging others to stay silent. It's fine if you just want to fly under the radar, but encouraging others to do the same only sets us back as a group.   > But to anyone else, it’s not worth it

That's subjective, and each person gets to decide for themselves if/how/when to disclose. It's a case of **Know Your Audience**.

My focus when I'm sharing my experiences with ADHD isn't so much on how I mess up because of it, but educating others about ADHD.

Drinking coffee with friends, and I'll say *'I can drink two of these coffees and want to sleep.'* 

People naturally want to know why, I explain and inevitably this comes up: 

*'I would never have thought you had ADHD'* or they'll talk about the stereotypical Bart Simpson trope, which is when I turn up the teaching mode, making the most important part of my 'lesson' that it is not a 'mental health' issue in the same way a personality disorder is, but rather a neurobiology issue and that it just means my brain is wired differently and that I excel in running through ideas. I'll even share the weird/rarely known elements of ADHD, like the novocaine resistance and more often than not- they're fascinated, not combative.

***People are far more receptive to learning and reevaluating their views if you teach them, rather than blaming the disorder.***

OP isn't strictly wrong, there are a bunch of people I know who are both diagnosed and self-diagnosed ADHD who I feel set everybody with the disorder back by talking about it, purely because they actually adopt the stereotype even if it's not their true self, however that means that real ambassadors need to step their game up. [removed] I saved this post so I can look back at it for reference! Lol  And don't forget: even if you're not getting the "hungry" and "tired" signals, your body and brain are still hungry/tired. You will become more agitated, your thinking will slow or become distorted, and you'll get actively worse at managing tasks. You still experience the same setbacks of being without energy, your brain just isn't receiving the signals for it. You can be sluggish without feeling sluggish.  Thanks so much for the reply... I'm a junior and got diagnosed in September, and I'm trying to get my parents to agree with telling my school. I don't know if I'd be able to get accommodations but I think I'd just feel better if my guidance counselor (and probably teachers) knew. Oh, I didn't know that, I was sure it was a learning disability. Thanks! The stigma exists because rich people profit from it. How many people constantly talking about their struggles does it take to reach the same audience a single well-timed tweet from the head of the NRA did? And its not just him it's the entire Newscorp Empire.  Getting yourself fired over and over by placing yourself into their crosshairs won't stop the stigma. If you want to create change you have to find a way to affect the economics of the world so the stigma can't be used for profit by people who are too old and tired to find a new source, or so the lack thereof is even more profitable for many people who are still building their own income streams.

Since you brought up the suffrage movement, that would never have happened with just a lot of noise. History is full of examples where there was noise and no change. What actually caused change was the fact that much of the manufacturing workforce was quitting their jobs as their husbands came home from the war and another chunk was desperate to work as their husbands didn't.  The powers who profit from manufacturing were facing a huge loss of trained staff for the old workers who lost some of those skills they stopped using for a few years.

That wasn't the first or last time women demanded equal rights but it was the time when that demand lined up with economic upheval so that's why it worked that time.

Similarly on our case slackivism is all it takes when the money aligns, and no amount of going beyond that will be enough when the money side doesn't align. As is life my friend. I only warn against it because I’ve seen members of the ADHD clan (friends of mine) lose the confidence of their peers/employers once they out themselves. 

One guy I worked with (we’ll call him Greg) chose to be open about his diagnosis and has worn the label since. He’s scrutinized more when he screws up because now management _expects_ him to. Coworkers make remarks (that they think are harmless) like “All there today Greg?” if he looks like he’s spacing out while thinking or “He’s in Greg land today” if he’s not quick to an email response. 

So tell whoever you want to, but remember it’s something you can’t put back in the box once it’s out.  I think this is the most important thing. I talk about my ADHD pretty openly, but I'm in a comfortable and safe enough place in my life to be able to do so.

&#x200B;

However, just like any/all other disenfranchised groups that have the choice of disclosing their status or keeping quiet about it -- **it is always your choice and you should never feel bad for keeping it to yourself if you don't feel comfortable talking about it.** **Yes, it's often up to us to change the world around us, but it is not our fault that the world is hard and cold.** Sometimes you just gotta get by and if that means taking a break from actively removing the stigma around ADHD, that's okay. We're all just living our lives and we get to decide when and how we can realistically make the world a better place. No. That's 100% false. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder. You can't spontaneously *become* ADHD. Under a certain age, you can't diagnose ADHD, every kid "has ADHD". So I think on some level it's lacking that ability to grow out of it.

Doesn't answer your question, but yeah. At most they've linked it to a family members giving higher odds of you having it, so genetics a definite factor and "difficult pregnancies" like myself, so I guess the brain having less than ideal development in the womb.  School guidance counselors are very discrete and the school knowing of your diagnosis wouldn’t be a bad thing.

Side note: My parents definitely wanted to keep my own diagnosis hush hush because THEY were embarrassed over it. That sucked, but let me tell you something. You aren’t broken. If your parents or anyone else has made you feel that way, they’re misinformed and that’s on them. Don’t for a second let anyone make you feel shame for being a different shade of blue. I made it through HS and just recently finished my bachelors degree. If I can do it, you can do it. 

Good luck! Oh god that would drive me insane. So patronizing. Leave me be I'll get the work done!!! (Eventually) Totally - it’s each person’s choice and we can’t give blanket advice.
