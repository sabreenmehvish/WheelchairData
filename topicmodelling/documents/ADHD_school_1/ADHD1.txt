While preparing for an eventual assessment, I’ve found some of old my school reports. I can’t help but think why didn’t my teachers or parents see there was something wrong. The system ruined my potential and I can’t help but feel resentful. (32m) I’m almost positive I have attentive ADHD and I’ve started the process with my GP for an assessment, it may take awhile due to me using the NHS (I live in the UK) rather than private methods due to lack of money. 

I’ve always struggled in most aspects of my life, always felt odd and different, and have spectacularly failed academically throughout school and college (didn’t get any GCSEs and slept through most of my exams) despite people throughout my life complimenting me on my apparent intelligence and ability to articulate. 

In my late 20’s I decided enough was enough and went back to college to learn to read and write correctly. I then went to university and overachieved, this was due to my ability to knock out projects quickly (I knew that if I I left it any longer, I would soon lose my motivation and my lack of discipline would fail me) So for one project, I would hand in four smaller projects. I ended up getting the highest grade given by the course in over 20 years!

This obviously was great, but it also taught me that my potential was greater then I would’ve ever thought. I assumed I would always be a failure, and I was the lazy, selfish, slow, strange guy my family, teachers, colleagues, partners described me as. 

However, I was obsessed with self improvement. I believe this was due to me trying to make up with all the things society told me I lacked, and I wanted to prove everyone wrong!  However time after time, my motivation would atrophy and I efforts failed me. 

I noticed my weight started to pile on, my friendships slowly disappeared, my energy levels drop further due to lack of self care, and most importantly, I was struggling to fulfil my potential of being a father to my 2 year old son. I started to feel like a failure on lost time.

So, after researching, I feel like I have ADHD-PI, and after finding my school reports for assessment, I can’t help but feel terrible for the little boy I was. 

“Louis only got 11% on his test score, he drifts far too much, he needs to try harder”

“Louis appears bright but has no ability to concentrate, he needs to pay more attention if he wants to succeed”

“Louis initially appears interested but loses focus quickly into each session, this is not good enough”

Every report said the same shit!

Why wasn’t this obvious to my teachers and parents? instead I got screamed at, constantly disciplined, constant after school detentions. 

Every morning waking up for school was like torture, knowing I had to face the shit storm.

I learned to withdraw inside of myself, and suppress all emotions. 

However, at least I can say, I didn’t fail school, school failed me!

Sorry for the rant, this week has been a tough one. 

(Update: Wow, I posted this as a way of unloading some frustration, and never expected such a large amount of feedback. All of your advice, stories and empathy has really warmed my heart. To know that many others have been in very similar shoes both feels nice, but also compounds my frustration, why wasn’t this obvious? 

I’d just like to add, I love my life and I’m generally one of the most positive people in the room. I have an incredible wife and a beautiful family, despite my struggles I deal fairly well. Things just got in top of me yesterday and my frustrations splurged out. This community itself is a blessing. Knowing me, It will take a couple of days to respond to all your reassuring messages, but I’ll get there! Thanks everyone.)  Oh, I can completely relate to what you’re saying and feeling.  I was constantly told I wasn’t making an effort,  wasn’t applying myself, lazy and everything else that comes along with ADHD.  It didn’t help that my mom constantly told me I would be in jail when I grew up, and the physical abuse I suffered from getting poor grades.  I had to let go of that, as you can not change the past.

People here give very helpful advice on how to handle your life and to provide support.   So, you can mourn the child you once were, and the missed opportunities for a diagnosis.  At some point you need to give that child a hug and move on.  You should consider letting go that resentfulness of what should have, or could have happened in the past, as the past will never change.  I had to do that too.   Teared up reading this. I can relate. Every teacher/mentor I had came away with the following: I'm intelligent, but will never amount to much if I didn't stop "dreaming" and "focused more". This resulted in me going through five schools in about 10 years at different levels with only a basic high-school diploma to show for it afterwards.

It kills me to think there are children right now who feel so misunderstood because the professionals/parents who raise them have no idea the problem even exists or how to deal with it. Makes me angrier to know AD(H)D has been documented since late 18th century and there is no lack of educational resources in professional communities. That being said, I haven't seen the inside of a high school in over a decade, so there might be changes I'm not aware of.

In any case: there's more of us than you might think and we'll be fine as long as we stay true and honest to and about ourselves.   
You're dealing with this (sharing it openly, no small feat) and still pushing through the shit show life can be, even raising a son. I love you for all of it (no homo). I totally relate, it's hard not to feel resentful and upset about teachers/parents/whoever missing it but I think it's also due to ignorance on the subject. Especially since ADHD has only recently gained more widespread attention, so a lot of adults are now being diagnosed because when we were young it just wasn't understood. 

I too feel like literally all of my problems in life were due to my ADHD (inattentive) brain and I could've saved myself a lot of heartache and liver ache due to substance abuse etc if I'd known earlier. But oh well, just gotta look forward and feel relieved that it's not because I'm a failure or broken in some way. I try now to think of ADHD as a kind of super power lol.

Good luck on your diagnosis journey! Hope you find some relief soon. I'm so sorry for your experience with ADHD growing up and I'm glad you've been diagnosed now but here's what I'm going to do; I'm not justifying any of the mistakes that happened to you, but I am going to play devil's advocate a bit so that you can hopefully let go of some of your anger about what happened in the past.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing, not everyone understood or even knew about ADHD 15 to 20 years and so they just assumed that some children were just not trying hard enough. Teachers knew the kid was smart but for some reason just didn't show it on tests or assignments. As a teacher (and someone with ADD) I can tell you that kids who talk out and dont finish their work and aren't focusing or listening to instructions really DO look like they are making a choice to act this way. And they can be difficult to manage in a classroom. If I feel this way as someone with ADD who understands it's not a choice, how would other teachers perceive these children? It's hard managing 25 kids and covering all the curriculum and it IS very annoying and frustrating and stressful when kids talk out or act out. I know some of them aren't doing it on purpose but that doesn't change how irksome it is, lol. The school system itself just isn't set up that well to teach everyone the way they need to be taught but, most teachers, are trying their best and the education system has come a long way from where it was when we were kids. (Yay for differentiated instruction and accommodations for kids!  Though it's way more work for me as a teacher...still great progress, though it would be better with smaller class sizes so I could give each student more attention and focus.)

&#x200B;

Furthermore, teachers (at least where I live in Ontario, Canada) CANNOT diagnose children. We cannot tell parents we think their kid has ADHD or autism or aything because we are not trained psychologists. We just can't do it. All we can do is tell parents things like "Johnny has a lot of trouble focusing...are you noticing this at home too?" and hope that parents pick up on the clues (especially if teachers have been making the same comments in interviews and on report cards every year) and get Johnny tested themselves. I can't say that I think Johnny might have ADHD so please get him tested. And if parents refuse to get their child tested there is not much I can do. I can't modify the curriculum without an IEP, though I can try out some accommodations (sitting closer to the front of the classroom, getting more time to write a test,,,maybe, though where is this time supposed to come from?!....etc.) So maybe your teachers did talk to your parents but they didn't get you tested. I'm just saying, it might not have all been on the teachers, though it very well could have been, not all teachers take their job as seriously as they should and not all teachers care about students as much as they should.

&#x200B;

The best thing you can do is learn from their mistakes, your teachers and your parents, and advocate for your own child as ADHD is often hereditary. Also, don't be afraid to educate and inform those around you, like your friends with kids, about ADHD so that more kids are diagnosed sooner rather than later. Again, I feel terrible for the little boy you were too and I wish so much that you had gotten the help and support you needed instead of being made to feel like you were stupid and lazy. As a techer, I just hope that you can let the anger go so that you can foster a love of learning and the importance of education in your own child.  :D

&#x200B; When I told my mom I was diagnosed with ADHD at 26, her answer was "Oh, yeah I always figured you had that." like it was no big deal. That really pissed me off because I could have done so much better in school and life in general if she'd done something about it. But as I examined my life I realized that I've always been my own best advocate and champion, and I've really taken control of things after diagnosis. My life is finally something I can manage, and I've made huge strides in the last four years. I finally finished my bachelor's degree, I have a good job, and I'm looking at pursuing my masters degree. So, it totally sucks that nobody noticed or cared, but you can't change the past. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. I first had a resentment for my parents, but my understanding is that ADHD treatment was very new back then, and societies general perception (in the US at least) was very binary on the matter. Parents didn't want to give their kids drugs similar to meth to treat a disease that wasn't well understood, and to many, believed to be a "personality traits" rather than an illness. I was diagnosed my a child psychologist at age 6, never treated, failed at everything I've ever tried, and just last month began taking concerta, I still feel like my regiment could use fine tuning, and I'm going back to my psychiatrist in a few days to talk about it, but for the first time in my life, I feel capable of success, and I'm hoping to put it to the test by taking a single community college class next semester. I'm also ADD-PI, and so are my 3 sons. I was only diagnosed when my eldest son had a concerned teacher call me in when he was 17!!! I do feel that everything was a lot harder for me than it should have been - school, studying, working. I'm just thankful that my sons don't have to struggle as much... My 1st grade teacher told my mom I had some kind of learning disability and my mom ignored it. I got held back a grade and suffered for it. Barley graduated high school. I got diagnosed at 38 and I'm back in school tomorrow to get my AA in computer science. The best thing you can do is move forward and do the best with what you got. You got this! My reports said the same thing. "She's bright but doesn't try hard enough." Like, since I wasn't an idiot, I couldn't possibly be struggling with an actual problem that could deserve treatment and care. Grrr. I feel this, no one figured out I'm dyslexic. They literally thought I was both farsighted and nearsighted and gave me two pairs of glasses that I never wore. 
I had a really hard time learning to spell so they would make me sit at a table and write out the same word over and over until I completely filled both sides of page of loose-leaf paper; then they would get mad that there were inconsistencies and that I still generally couldn't get the word right... Came here expecting to say that when you’re performing adequately academically, the school won’t usually step in, but clearly this wasn’t the case. All I do have to say is that the way society views learning disabilities, mental illness, and any other subtle disabilities has come a long way in the past 10 to 20 years. Special education is a lot more efficient now. Unfortunately, it seems like a lot of people used to just slip through the cracks if it seemed like their problems were behavioral and they didn’t have another obvious disability. 

It was also before the age of information when parents had a world of knowledge at their fingertips from the internet. Now, parents are better at researching symptoms and advocating for their children. 

I did okay academically but always scraped by doing everything the last minute, motivated by fear of failure or punishment. No one ever thought to suggest I had ADHD, I was just kind of lazy and a daydreamer. I didn’t really know think about it until I became a Speech Language Pathologist (college was my actual worst nightmare) and started working in an elementary school, where I’m part of special education. Hearing about all the kids symptoms finally made it click, and I got diagnosed this year and started taking vyvanse. Work is way easier, and I no longer feel like I’m chronically underachieving. I also maintain a somewhat clean house and don’t forget to pay my bills. I’ve started to enjoy things that I’ve been previously interested in, but had difficulty sustaining attention for.

It sucks that you had to go through all that, but it’s not too late to make the best of your life. Knowing how to deal with the problem effectively is the first step, and you have a lot of years left to work toward your goals.  Smart people get later diagnosis. Hope you are ok now. Good luck with assessment.  I was a quiet, stressed kid too. It's been important for me to move past that resentment though. Part of truly maturing is realizing that those adults are and we're always only human. People overlook things and don't make good decisions; me included. It's a waste of energy dwelling on the past my friend. You deserve to be happy. I feel you, I'm constantly swinging back and forth over hating myself and trying to improve and feeling drained and like society has failed me. I figure its a little of column A and a little of Coulmn B. Still feels like im going to die poor, alone, and still working a minimum wage retail job. Im 27 :( I'm planning on getting some of my school reports ready soon too. Mine were always "a delight to have in class, but never completed work on time. Always seems distracted."

Do you know what my parents solution to my inattentiveness in class was?? 

Put me in French immersion!! 

It honestly helped a lot with my attention because I had to actually learn a new language while learning new concepts. So, in a weird way, they helped me short term to get thru high school. Now I struggle to remember garbage day every week even tho it hasn't changed in the last 10 years...  It can be a hard process to mourn for the years you consider lost.
I'm your age, also from the UK and diagnosed in the past 2 years.

Try and be calm, be rational. It simply was not a "thing" when we were at school just the same as autism and other disorders weren't. You are not getting those years back.

You may find comfort in blaming "school" but you're perhaps less inclined to blame your parents because you love them and you don't love school.

Focus on what you are going to do to make the most of what is ahead, what you can do to make peace with the past and become the best person you can be.

We are here to listen, we are here to help and support and if you ever have any UK specific question my inbox is ready and waiting.

Be good to yourself :)  Yes! I am *exactly* in the same boat of you. I hated school. I'd say that at least 90% of my memories there are negative.

Year after year after year, all that was in my reports were "He frequently needs reminding to stay on task" or "Regularly shows little to no interest in some of the subjects" yet after 13 years in school, *nobody* thought to say to me or my parents "Maybe there is something wrong with him, maybe were dealing with him all wrong".

I'm also from the UK and I definitely get the whole waiting game is a ballache, I eventually did go private myself, yet I do feel sad for people who can't afford to do so. I hope you get an assessment sooner or later and I hope its what your asking for. I feel the same.  I was diagnosed at 30 and Always wondered why my mother never realized I had adhd- she was a special education teacher!  

Then she came and stayed with me for a week-long visit and I realized she probably has it too  Look at your life now.. Where you are. Are you happy with how things turned out? (not comparing to how they might have been but the actual current situation of your life) Do you have a loving family and are in a place you enjoy?

That was my secret for getting past the regret and resentful thoughts of what could have been. Sure I could have been much better than what I have now but I'm happy with what I have so... It turned out OK huh?

This is a common reaction I've seen in older people getting diagnosed or discovering the issue for the first time and realizing it has a name and possible help to deal with it. You are not alone in this friend, and you can come terms with it. 

Hope that helps put it in perspective for you.  I always got the same stuff on my report cards "smart, but doesn't apply himself" and variations of that

In early elementary school my teacher actually told my parents that they think I have ADHD but my parents didn't do anything about it ❤️ I always heard the same thing about being clever but not focussing and daydreaming. I managed to get an adhd diagnosis & a script in my last year of uni, was given Ritalin but honestly it didn’t help loads as it made me feel shit despite giving me better focus. 
My dr refused to let me try other stimulant scripts due to my side effects. So I was only medicated for about 5 months.
Back to square one. Also should note I’ve been jobless for 6 months out of uni and starting to lose the will to live. God I'm so sorry, you deserved so much better. School really did fail you. I wish people were motivated to assume that kids do want to do stuff and ask why theyre having issues rather than jumping to blame and write young people off.

 I'm your age and just got diagnosis ... I actually just finished undergrad and I acheived really highly there too! But it took so much effort and time that I had nothing at all else in my life and seeing the difference between myself and other students who just sat down and wrote stuff without drifting off every ten seconds helped me realise there probably was adhd going on. I was lucky enough to get through earlier school okay but my home life fucked me up: I was constantly, all the time not doing things I was meant to or going slower than I was meant to  and it was always because I drifted off or I forgot. I couldn't control it!! Always, every day, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot. And they always assumed it was because I didnt care, was lazy, didn't want to do it, being naughty, etc. Never felt sure that my parents loved me. Of course other stuff caused that too not just their attitude to my forgetfulness but I was a sensitive child (which ... comes from adhd too it seems) and I can see now how deeply those experiences have affected me - I will probably never be able to stop being afraid of being in trouble and insecurely and pathetically desperate to please everyone around me. Age is helping but some scars get ingrained deeply. 

From 20 to 30 in many ways I feel like my life has been wasted because I havent been able to do things like making art and writing that would have made things feel worthwhile. Struggling to keep on top of a job and other basic life stuff took all my spoons and left nothing left, and just didnt have concentration or motivation. I think Ive found the meds that work for me - dexamfetamine - and I think it might change my life but I'm nervous about hoping too much. So far so good tho. I've been drawing again, sorting my room, writing a story. It's not perfect - especially as i can only get short acting dex here - but I feel hopeful (and it seems to help my depression, which helps with the hope lmao).  One thing my struggles have given me beside exhaustion, eternally perpetuated anxiety and depression is that I'm incredibly fucking determined. SO determined. I've had to be. With that determination and meds to help, who knows? I might be unstoppable. I hope the same for you too. 

Good luck with the assessment. I'm in the public system in my country too (new zealand) and highly advise talking to other adhders and researching what is available in terms of meds, etc. Idk what your system is like but I know public system in nz is pretty bad for adhd - theyre not experienced with it and tend to obsess about abuse of the meds -  and knowledge i got from other people with adhd who'd gone private to competant professionals was crucial cause it meant I knew things like yes everyone does react differently to different meds so it IS worth it to try different ones, and actually ritalin is NOT the only stimulant med, and allowed me to ask (very carefully) for other meds to try, so I actually got the ones I needed.  In school I got to hear ”why do you think you have have problems with this? And say you don’t understand? You are doing great!” 

So instead of investigating what I wanted to communicate I basically got gaslighted and it was brushed off as a ”low self-esteem” which it of course lead into eventually.. thanks a lot. Also, I lack a lot of important steps in math so most of that is poorly built..

But I -myself- decided that I would NOT be tested, when at 6y it was up for discussion. I knew very well that such a thing would not make anything better, I would just be even more of a burden. Little did I know the consequences of that in the years to come. Not sure it really was the wrong decision but I will have to live with it either way and I made huge progress that I might not have otherwise.  I’m right there with you dude, it’s almost like mourning .  I’m kind of pissed that when I was a child, it seemed that only boys who couldn’t sit still were diagnosed.  As a quiet girl, who still had inattentive symptoms, I’m sure it never crossed anyone’s mind that I needed help, too.  This is how my husband feels. He has been treated like he is a failure his whole life. His dad used to throw that over his head all the time. 
I had a dad who tutored me, gave me a lot of habits and routines,  and helped me do really well. My husband got none of that. Now that we have a son with ADHD as well we are doing our best to help him succeed as much as we can and we are really involved.  I remember having all those things happen to me, my parents and school would talk to me about my "learning disabilities'.  I fought them tooth and nail because I was in highschool, thought being a Teen was difficult without being thought or treated as too different.  Shit, I got diagnosed with ADD when I was 6, put on Ritalin and put into ESL for two years, I feel you, I stopped taking meds when I was 12, my own choice but it shouldn't of been now as an almost 30 year old I'm struggling and can't find a doctor to put the time into me.  Yes my substance abuse was just with alcohol and not super severe.  It is truly amazing that a person on the internet can describe my own life.  From the UK too, actually diagnosed in France. Great post. My thoughts on this are that this disorder was (and still pretty much remains) completely unknown to the lay population. It never comes up as a possibility. It is even worse here in France.

My advice would be to read up and then advocate for yourself, be prepared for a big wait if you go via the NHS and prepare to be fobbed off.

I wish you the best of luck, you got this!! It breaks me to know another person suffered the torture I experienced. How couldn't they tell? Why I did I have to feel so alone, the black sheep of family disappointment, for so many years? From another one of the lost-boys to another: I'm proud of you for all the suffering you shouldered in spite of the adversity. 

I'm thriving now too. It had taken 5 years to somewhat bandage and heal the scars of a broken and franklg neglected childhood, but thank you for helping me feel not so alone.  I feel like school failed me too. I got the same observations from all of my teachers - notes essentially saying that I’m not living up to my potential, I talk too much during class, I make careless mistakes, I don’t pay enough attention, I don’t turn in my homework, my desk is a mess. 

I’m a couple years younger than you, I think the reason those things weren’t noticed is because it wasn’t as widely known then. I was diagnosed at 15 just because I’d heard about it from other friends - I went to my mom about it and she took me to the doctor. After I was diagnosed, my mom was like “oh shit, this is a real thing” and finally had something to point to for her own ADHDness. Come to think of it, I should probably be mad that she reamed my ass so hard for the things my teachers were saying - especially because she has the same issue lol but I guess moms just want their children to be better than they are, I dunno.

I also know what it’s like to try super hard at self-improvement, only to inevitably fall short. That’s probably the worst feeling there is. It makes you feel like a fuck up or like you’re lesser than. I dunno about anyone else but I still haven’t quite come to terms with this lol maybe one day. Sounds very similar to my childhood situation. You’ve done well to let go of the past, and I think my frustrations were an inevitable part of the process, thank you. I’ve been a mild lurker here for awhile but as I’ve become more self assured of my problem, I’ll be spending more time interacting in this lovely community. Nice to know we are not alone in our frustrations.  Where was it documented in the 18th century? Not doubting you, just curious. Sorry for how you felt as a child, my heart goes out to you. The fact that kids right now are suffering is hard to think about, but yes things have improved, I see good things in the future for ADHD kids. 

Thanks for your kind words, my son is my world and I suppose every parent feels guilt regardless of having ADHD or not. I hope he understands that, despite my struggles with the routines parenthood requires, he is cherished. I'll never let him forget that.

Love you to bro! Sorry for my late reply. [deleted] Sorry I took this long to reply, all of the these messages kind of overwhelmed me and it took awhile to settle down and individually reply. I'm sure you can relate to me!

You are correct about the lack of knowledge on the subject of ADHD. I realize this now, and I'm much more optimistic. I feel I had to go through the process of resentment, to get acceptance. Thanks to my ADHD brain, I'm now over the resentment and I'm super excited to figuring this shit out! I've managed to raise the funds for a private diagnosis thanks to my beautiful family, and I'm getting assessed in March.

&#x200B;

You are not broken, and indeed you have a super power. It's an erratic laser that is hard to fire on target, but once we do, magic happens. This is interesting about teachers not recommending testing. 

I also live in Canada and my mom was told to get my brother tested as a kid by a teacher, or at least someone from the school. Would guidance councillors have been able to do This? This was 12-14 years ago.  Thank you for your story! This is incredibly inspiring for me. My dad's a "hyper airhead" and so is his mom and so am I. At least, that's how they describe what looks like ADHD in eastern Europe. I'm about to take an ADHD assessment as a 32 year old and I damn well hope I can achieve what you have.  Hiya. 18mg or 36mg? I have ended up on 36 + two more little ones one each in afternoon and evening 5mg + 5mg = 46mg total. 

I can totally tell when I need more - fidgets, stares, drifting.  The whole thing seems new internationally, however I know that europe in generally are behind the US in regards treatments and overall acceptance. However, I've noticed we get much less backlash in the whole "our country is drugging our children" debate. Glad you are on your way with finding your perfect dose, I'm eager to get my assessment and start on this whole journey.


Thanks for your reply :) I read somewhere that girls, especially gifted/highly intelligent girls, are MUCH less likely to be diagnosed because they're quieter than boys with ADD/ADHD. They fly under the radar, especially when they tend to get some really good marks, just not consistently. Yup, I was one of these girls, too. 

I'm really resentful of all the time I wasted, but I've come to believe that there's just no point in being pissed at the past and the stupid ways the adults in our lives tried and failed to deal with us. Personally, I am focusing on learning as much as I can about myself and my potential and how to achieve it -- and remembering that one day when I have kids, I will treat them as individuals and NOT ASSUME that they are trying to "be bad." They probably really just need help and understanding. 

I wish you the best... the struggle to forgive and move on is real.  ADHD I can maybe understand why people don't get because it's outwardly quite subtle (despite my own very bad experiences). But being dyslexic is like ... you can't read! Maybe there are really ignorant parents out there, but how does that get past trained educators!?! Regardless of what we knew when, parents are supposed to curious and focused on helping the child solve the problem, not focused on their own frustration. So you’re right that a lot of responsibility lies with the parent. It certainly doesn’t belong to the child.

However, this approach is easier said than done when the parents both likely experienced abuse and were certainly dealing with unprocessed and unresolved trauma. It’s a cultural, systemic, and generational problem that’s bigger than any one person can fix on their own. Undiagnosed adhd May also have been a factor.

u/lou323, the body keeps the score is a great book on this. If you’re still interested in learning more, I highly recommend it. Thank you for your kind message, I apologize with my lateness, I got a little overwhelmed with the feedback. 

You are absolutely correct about the diagnosis, I have now changed my stance on everything and I'm now eager to get diagnosed. My parents are very old school and wasn't clued up on mental health, they are lovely, compassionate, yet ignorant, and they just thought I was unique. I can't point the blame anymore, the world was different, actually I'm thankful that I wasn't born 50, 75 or 100 years ago when things were much more rough for people like us. 

Regarding the UK advice, I may have to take you up on that. I have now managed to get the funds together for a private diagnosis in March. 

&#x200B;

Thanks again, this community is really lovely.

&#x200B;

&#x200B; I told my Dad and he said "everyone's a little ADD". No Dad, no they're not. He totally has it. >Look at your life now.. Where you are. Are you happy with how things turned out? (not comparing to how they might have been but the actual current situation of your life) Do you have a loving family and are in a place you enjoy?

Depends on who you ask, I guess. I'm not happy with how *anything* in my life has turned out. Couldn't hold down a job, couldn't stay in a relationship because I always got bored, constantly tired, too 'lazy' to do even the most basic household chores, constantly forgetting even the most basic things like paying rent or parking fines (which would then blow out into hundreds of dollars owed), etc.

 I genuinely thought I was brain damaged. Turns out it was just ADHD. I'm turning 30 next year and it has been really difficult getting my life back on track. It's like trying to piece together a broken vase...except the vase is covered in shit.  this one hit close to home I don't actually really blame anyone for not picking up my adhd as a kid - I know inattentive can be hard to pick up, and my hyperactivity was expressed mostly through fidgetting or talking endlessly, which ppl dont tend to realise the significance of. I went to a little 7 kid alternative school till I was 10 which was a perfect environment for me, and from then on I coasted on writing ability, so it didn't stand out at school. But I do think, label or not, adults need to be much more fucking compassionate towards kids and when the kids are being "naughty" ask why and how they can help, when kids have persistent issues with concentration, memory, energy etc that punishment doesnt work on they should react with problem solving not by adding more punishment. Hell they might try not reacting with punishment in the first place (not gonna lie, my current love for positive reinforcement dog training that is based around rewarding good behavior, setting the animal up to succeed no matter how small the steps are that need to be taken, and redirecting to a different behavior rather than punishing an unwanted behaviour? is ... probably very linked to how I wish very much I had been treated with as much support and compassion as a child and young adult. if it couldn't happen for me, i can at least give it to my dog). 

And god damn i wish there was more real knowledge about adhd out there. Recognising inattentive type and different ways hyperactivity can manifest to actually pick up kids earlier to needed help would change so many lives and stop so much suffering.  Sir Alexander Crichton in 1798. Shouldn't be hard to find more about it Not the one you asked, but I was (Adderall XR). I had to agree to random drug tests but never got one and switched psychiatrists after three months. I'm an alcoholic and was 10 months sober at the time, plus admitted to past weed and hallucinogen use. 27 actually. Generic methylphenidate hcl er.

My most pronounced symptoms have always been over-talking, nail/cuticle picking and chewing, and excessive motor habits, and a massive lack of attention.

The juice has made my attention much better, and I actually trimmed my fingernails with clippers for the first time in about 5 years a week ago, but I still have trouble with over-talking and tapping my finger/feet. 

I'm thinking those habits that are uncontrolled may have more to do with anxiety, but I'm going to see what the doc says about it, first go around, he also gave me some propranolol to control symptoms of anxiety when I know I'll be entering a high stress situation, but i was instructed to only use it as needed for situational anxiety, so I'll see if a higher dose of methylphenidate might be better to control those constant symptoms. My guess is that because I came from a not so good home, I didn't know how to open up to my teachers and explain it. I would just not do school work and say it's because I didn't want to.
There's also different variations of dyslexia. I can read now, it just took a lot of effort and I'm a lot slower than most people. 
 I understand your feelings, I've been through them and sometimes still have to work through them.

I understand you're projecting your situation here, of which I have no background information to offer much comment, however it is a peaceful mind that will allow OP to move forward with the situation.

I can point to many signposts in my life and tell you how I think things would be different with some intervention.

If I'd been diagnosed 3 years ago instead of 2 I might still be married instead of divorced, I might be putting my kids to bed every night, I might be living a fulfilling life. Instead I work, I drown in debt, I spend 2 days a week with my children, I put them to bed once a fortnight and pretty much every moment I am not working or with my children I am at home. Alone.

If I'd been diagnosed 10 years ago I maybe would never have been married and has kids.

15 years ago and maybe I goto university.

How many times should I repeat those thoughts before I make peace?

Instead ive learned to take the blame for my mistakes. I was a bad husband towards the end of my marriage. Not "I was bad husband towards the end of my marriage". The second sentence doesn't make my ex wife forgive me, it doesn't make me forgive myself.

What I am doing to become a better father matters. What I am doing to make myself emotionally ready for a future relationship matters.  Wow, you hit the nail on the head. My dad (who also I believe has undiagnosed ADHD, his symptoms are worse than mine) received the belt and horrendous mistreatment for his behavior. My mother also was beaten. I've added that book to my list, thank you. I'm sure have some unresolved trauma that could be hindering me.

Sorry for the late reply, I got swamped with lovely comments and I got overwhelmed. :) 
 Mine does, too, and says the same thing.  *nods* That was how I felt about 10 years ago (at 26). In that time I went through a really bad and abusive relationship, changed careers, struggled with my parents and my life and where I could have been if I had only been able to -stick- with anything (This was all before realizing I had ADHD)

I also eventually met a wonderful woman who understands my quirks, treats me good, and is willing to openly talk with me about her issues along with mine. We got married, we have a 9 month old. I've had the same job for 5 years now (don't exactly like it: its not a forever job, but still) and we live a comfortable life.

I say this only to say... I've been there. I got past it. It sure as hell wasn't easy, and it sure as hell didn't happen over night.  I had a lot of bleak and dark days. I had a lot of bad times where I was alone, in a crappy apartment in the bad side of town with gunshots every night and people screaming for help every week. I had no money to my name and no friends. 

But ... it can get better. Hang in there buddy. It can get better.  Thanks. Cool. Hope you are doing well. I love it here.  With all due respect, I think you're actually putting me at a different stage of therapy than I'm at. It's possible that you are in fact projecting your situation as we all tend to do--including me--so this is not a judgement against you by any means. However, I feel that I have been where you appear to be now. Critically, responsibility is different from blame.

I now study the neuroscience of child development, trauma, and ADHD. No person is an island. We are all affected by the interpersonal relationships we have in our lives, and we are all empowered and disempowered to varying degrees by the many-layered systems we operate within.

The idea that things are any other way is a result of two things mainly (if you can forgive a vast oversimplification): moral judgement in our society, i.e. the protestant work ethic, and the fact that what's \*conscious\*--cognition and behaviour--has historically been more empirically measurable than emotion, which to a limited extent can be cognitively regulated, but to a much greater extent is driven by unconscious processes.

Being able to truly take personal responsibility comes from understanding our relationships with others and with these integrated systems. What can I reasonably expect from myself, from others, and from the various systems I access, work within, and move between? How do I improve my capacity to bring my thoughts, behaviours, and emotions into alignment with my values? How do I fill my gas tank so that I can be in a responsive rather than reactive state? How do I strike a calm and self-assured balance between being flexible and taking a stand? How can I develop the courage to discover and live my authentic self? If you can step outside of yourself long enough to look at the big picture, you begin to readjust beyond blame--whether that's blame of yourself or blame of others.

The key to all of this understanding use-dependent brain development, associative learning, and the pervasive effects of trauma in kids. Understanding the limitations of executive function. Understanding that our cognitive processes often mask what's happening beneath, because we are organisms who have evolved through natural selection for physical survival in a much more life-threatening world than the one we have now. None of these are matters for debate within the social developmental neuroscience research community. But it's a hard pill to swallow when the cognitive defenses are up.

Yes, you were a bad husband toward the end of your marriage. It was your responsibility to be a better husband. It's very tempting for the inquiry to stop there--because beyond the surface lays the really tough stuff. But if you're able to muck through it and really understand your "bad husband" behaviour as a focal point for exploration within a constantly fluctuating system of interconnected factors, you can begin to meaningfully identify avenues for increasing self-awareness and physical, cognitive, and emotional capacity. In other words, you can improve your capacity to remain present and mindful.

Hurt people hurt people. When people disconnect or lash out, it's because they're out of gas, not because they're bad people. It's a paradigm shift for sure, and an uncomfortable one if you're used to comparing yourself with others. But it's a paradigm shift based in neuroscience that can help you to emotionally let go--because that's the only kind of letting go that actually matters. Thanks for that! Sometimes it can be really hard to imagine things getting better. Like, in my head I know it will eventually happen, but because it's going to take a while to get there, I sometimes freak out over how daunting it's going to be and completely shut down. It really sucks. I've had a mix of ADHD and depression for about 5 years now, so I'm starting to feel a lot better now that I'm being medicated. I'm actually making long-term plans for the first time ever, which is a pretty big deal for me because I used to struggle to even think a few days in advance D: Yeah I think you are right and I can see that I wasn't offering a very wide perspective within my post. I think thats probably because much of my focus recently has been on having good days instead of bad.
For me to do that it requires me to lean heavily on my stoic nature, which I feel does great things for me in coping with day to day life.

The angle you are coming from can certainly offer great things in helping people process their struggles and keep fighting the hard fight to work through our deficits and keep driving uphill... Perhaps mine is more like putting the handbrake on once I've found a part of the hill that doesn't look so bad and just making sure I don't have to revisit that shitty part of the hill I've already gone past.

I appreciate your feedback and the time you've taken to share.


Mild hangover so apologies for anything that doesn't make sense.  Any time. Thanks for the awesome, open response 😊

With rest—physical and psychological—the hill begins to look a lot smaller and easier to tackle. Maybe because the backpack were carrying isn’t so heavy. 

Having adhd in a neurotypical world is beyond exhausting. It’s exhausting to hold all of these expectations of yourself—it feels like a juggling act wearing a backpack full of rocks.

Your body can only lift so much. Your strength is a precious resource—this is true for everyone, adhd or not. Digging deep isn’t the first step. First you take out the rocks at the top. I give you permission to take a nap—if it’s at all possible. 😊
