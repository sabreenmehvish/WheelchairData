I finished all of my finals and grad school apps!!!!! Guys I did it. Hell I had a few close calls in there turning in the Berkeley app at 1155 and it was due at 12 . And I may have just stayed up all night teaching myself quantum, but I think I did OK on my final. So I will mark it in the win collumn Submitting at 11:55... Too real Congratulations! You did it! My motto is if you dont turn it in at 1157 is it really living
 I did a 11:56 yesterday.. I got super anxious so hopefully my brain cuts it at 11:55 next time.
