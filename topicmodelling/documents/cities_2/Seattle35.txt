Some (helpful) tips for riding Metro buses.. I am an avid Metro bus rider. Here are some of the tips that will help you in your commute.

1. When you are running for the bus from behind, run really close to the bus on sidewalk so the driver can see you. If you run little farther from the bus 
    you are in the blind spot and you will miss the bus.

2. If you hate waiting at bus stops like me, there is an awesome  solution. First find the stop number of your bust stop. You can find them on top of the posted schedule. There are three sets
of numbers separated by "**-**", you want the middle number. It will either be a 3 or 4 digit number. Or if you are at a stop with shelter, just took at the
top of the shelter there is a number spray painted on it(Generally Yellow but sometimes White). Call (206) 456-0609, now press **1** and type in the bus stop number followed by "**#**".
You will here the expected arrival time of your bus.  Find out when your bus is arriving and leave accordingly. You can play around with the menu and bookmark the stop for future use.

3. Alternatively you can also go to trackermap.kingcounty.gov and wait for the popup window and type in the route number you want. Select two stops and see where the bus is between both the locations.

4. Generally avoid the two long front seats facing each other unless you don't mind getting up for Seniors of wheelchair person or sometimes white trash or really obese people. Some people avoid the first seats, though they have the most leg room.
Some people also avoid sitting in the back where lot of kids or people in groups talk really loudly and it gets obnoxious really fast.

5. If you have a bike on the bus and you are getting off, make sure you tell the bus driver about it. Once it happened that a driver almost started driving while I was unracking my bike.

6. If you see the stop is too crowded and you still have time, walk to the previous stop to get a seat. (More like GK)

7. If you have an Android/Iphone install the [onebusaway.**org**](http://onebusaway.org/) app. Thanks *PancakeHouse.*  

8. [*catguy*'s technique can get you a free ride.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/dmzb9/some_helpful_tips_for_riding_metro_buses/c11fd5f)

9. *BarbieDreamHearse* has written a  [kind article on public transportation etiquette](http://www.platkat.com/2008/04/learn-how-to-ride-a-bus-you-fucking-moron/)

10. Also if you are on a crowded bus and don't like to keep moving back and forth along the aisle, then stand on one of the back door steps, you may have to get off to clear some space, but it will avoid most of the hassle of holding on to the rods and not touching or falling on anyone.

 
Anything more you would like to add? When I'm at a stop and another bus (not mine) arrives, I'll ask passengers that are getting off that bus if they have a transfer they're not going to use. Sometimes they will, sometimes they won't. But when they do I get a free bus ride.

On the flip side, if I no longer need the transfer I got from my initial ride, I'll offer it to passengers waiting at the stop I just got off at. You know, to spread some of the love around. Don't put your fucking backpack/groceries/whateverthefuck you got in the seat next to you like its a fuckin child - the bus is crowded and people are standing when they could be sitting in that seat you dick.               

Get off your fucking phone.  Nobody wants to hear about the shitty movie you saw last night.            

MOVE for the disabled people if you're sitting up front - what the fuck is wrong with you?           

If I'm sitting in the seat right behind the long sideways bench, I'm not trying to take up all the leg room - honest.  The seatbelt thingy gets in the way of your leg so you have to sit tilted.           

Don't talk to people with headphones on.             



Yea I'm an angry metro rider sometimes. Be careful who you engage in conversation. On Metro, the odds are very good that someone who wants to talk to you is highly nuts.  When you are crowded in front of the door when it stops.  Hop off the bus, let people out, hop back on.  Don't make me jump over you, the dog, and luggage.  The OneBusAway app is outstanding.  It's almost always very accurate.

Edit to add: Annnnnnnd.....I get downvoted.  Wha?  The app is awesome 97% of the time.  3% of the time you're wondering why you've been standing there with the bus late and nowhere in sight with the app telling you it's there "NOW". I just pasted the whole damn thing from notepad and the formatting was so much easier/quicker. TIL If it after 7PM, you can request custom stops from the driver as long as it's on the physical route. Ignore #'s 2 & 3, get one bus away app (onebusaway.com).   No fatties. Yeah, that's classy. BarbieDreamHearse is kind of a bitch, sorry. Most important thing about riding KC Metro: know when and how much to pay. The ride free area is in effect downtown from 6AM to 7PM. During these times, trips heading outwards from downtown Seattle are pay as you leave. All other trips—all trips into Seattle, trips leaving downtown Seattle when the RFA isn't in effect, and trips that don't enter downtown at all—are pay as you enter.

Also, learn about what buses are interlined; that is, they begin their trips as one route and continue as another. The most useful for me is on late nights and Sundays the 43 and 44 are interlined. The second most useful is when he 31 becomes the 68. But be careful, only some individual trips participate! Check the schedule or One Bus Away. Google Maps is really the best way to navigate the bus system.  One Bus Away is good when you're at the right stop and want to double check, but Google Maps on a smart phone will tell you how to get from A to B easily. When riding out to the last stop on a heavily occupied bus, try and sit towards the front.  This minimize time spend on the awkward un-boarding period. If you ride the bus a lot, get a pass on your Orca card.  I pay $81 a month to ride unlimited, it's great. 1. Many of the buses change numbers. E.g., if you want to catch a 5 uptown, it's almost always a 54 or 55 from the west side, so you can catch one of those inbound before it changes the route number. More importantly, this means that you don't get off to transfer! Before I knew this I would get off of the 5 (thinking it was a 54, which is what I had boarded) and wait for the next 5 to come along. 
2. Do not run in front of a bus that you're about to miss. The driver will likely tell you that they aren't going to board you. Also you can die.
3. ORCA is as temperamental as can be. For some reason it works best if you press and hold the card to the reader rather than swiping it past. 
4. The drivers can't hear what's going on in back, so if people start getting rowdy back there don't just assume that the driver is going to do something. 
5. Regarding when to pay, there's a discouraging chart [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/MT_payment_flowchart.png). I ride mostly Sound Transit so I see this from time to time. Sound Transit doesn't accept paper transfers. So if you only really ever ride Metro (or Pierce Transit and maybe Community Transit?) don't try to use a paper transfer when riding Sound Transit. The driver won't take it and also don't try to argue with the driver about it either.
 Light rail question!

Am I really supposed to tap my ORCA card when I prepare to board the light rail, and again when I leave the light rail, effectively paying either two full fares or a full fare and a transfer rate? I swear, every time I tap as I leave, it just charges me again--but is it *supposed* to, in order to be a real fare or something?

I am just too confused. I want to pay my fare, but I don't want to overpay my fare. > Anything more you would like to add?

Well, since you asked... :-)

[Learn How to Ride a Bus, You Fucking Moron](http://www.platkat.com/2008/04/learn-how-to-ride-a-bus-you-fucking-moron/). If you have web on your phone (not just android/iphone) you should be able to bookmark onebusaway on your web bookmarks.  I have a Palm Treo 700p and I type in the bus stop number.

Oh and you can text your stop number into onebusaway to get your bus's ETA even if you don't have web on your phone. I actually need some help with the Sound Transit buses, don't know if any of you know about it. I tried to catch an express at a stop that google told me they stop at and they blazed right past me. Need I hail them? Is there a trick to being noticed? I swear the driver did not even glance at the stop... As stated before, have your fare before you enter/leave the bus.  If you're loading your bike, take you panniers off BEFORE the bus gets there.  You've got plenty of time to prepare, why delay everyone and have to hustle?  If you have a smartphone get the OneStopAway app. One of the most indispensable ones I've found. "Some people also avoid sitting in the back where lot of kids or people in groups talk really loudly and it gets obnoxious really fast."

It's all those white trash people you were talking about. I have happily received a transfer from someone like you. It made my day. This is amazing advice. I will use this when visiting!  I generally don't have a problem with this. But it should be noted that transfers are not transferable. 

That being said, I think it's awesome when people do this. Cool tip -- I've never encountered anyone asking/offering transfers before.

Unfortunately, with ORCA in place, it's only a matter of time until paper transfers are eliminated. ST has already done it, Kitsap did for a short time. I'll jump in on the angry rant :D :D I agree 100% about the bag thing.

On the 545 leaving Seattle what really bothers me are the people that don't have their money ready when it's time to pay up. It especially makes me crazy when we get to Overlake at Microsoft and tons of people are exiting. Most are tapping their Orca card and it's pretty quick and easy. Yet then the whole line has to stop because some guy needs to get his wallet out, find his money, count his change etc etc. You've had the whole ride to get your money out and you're just now getting it ready? Also, DON'T PUT YOUR FUCKING WET UMBRELLA ON AN EMPTY SEAT!!! This is never acceptable, but especially not when the bus is standing room only. You mean batshit crazy. Related golden rule: Never hit on someone on the bus.  It's not fair, they can't escape. >Ignore #'s 2 & 3, get one bus away app (onebusaway.com).  

If you own a smart phone I use GoogleMaps app on my dumb phone. [deleted] You gotta double dip with onebusaway using google maps.  The times listed on the google transit directions often do not actually line up with the real metro times. Or if you are a student then your college already offers a quarterly discount passes valid everywhere! Yeah, I hate this... why do they change numbers? No other city I lived in, does the bus change numbers. It's damn confusing. ORCA cards will provide free transfers between all the agencies in the area. Yes, it calculates your fare based on when you tapped on and when you tap off.  It also shows charges when you transfer from the bus to light rail, though it subtracts your previous bus fare from your rail trip.  I use this all the time, as I transfer from bus to light rail and only get charged once.  
 Two possibilities:   
1. The bus was full. Buses often stop picking people up if it is full of standing people.    
2. Express buses usually don't stop at every single bus stop on their route. They mostly stop at major intersections and transit centers. Sometimes there are exceptions near the beginning and ends of the route. Look for the route number on the sign. If it says "Express" or "Local and Express" (or something similar) beneath it, the express bus will stop there. If it doesn't (ie "Local only"), or the number isn't even on the sign, it won't.  Google Maps has now integrated the Sound Transit bus schedules, so you can use it.  Just click on the little "transit" button and put in your point A, point B, and time. you forgot stinky.  I wipe a little mint Chapstick under my nose and that helps in most cases. Thank you! I am going to start doing this from now on. there will always be a cheap/easy way for the poor and/or disorganized to access public transportation. if you eliminate paper transfers then the bus would have to be free because we're not paying twice! Yea, and speaking of that, especially if you're a bigger person: don't spin around with your fucking backpack on - you're hitting people in the face. You can also use it via txt messages! This version should work on any phone with WAP

http://onebusaway.org/where/text/ if your phone can use an app it's not really that dumb. Yes. You ask for a transfer when you pay your fare as you board, and then you use the transfer when you disembark.

Yet another reason to ditch the money-losing Ride Free Area. Or if you're in the Seattle school district, you can get a free unlimited orca card that expires upon graduating.  I know, that's why I said paper transfers. all this time we thought it was an ironic stash... Uh, no.  They'll expect you to use your ORCA card to show your transfer status. Otherwise, you'll pay full fare for each leg of your trip.

Community Transit, Everett Transit, and Sound Transit work like this **now**.   DO you text the same number? What do you text? Or you use an ORCA card and just swipe it at the card reader anytime someone tells you. It keeps track of your 'transfer' electronically for 2 hours after you pay. Yea, my cousin didn't get it because she lives within 5 miles of her school. Text "onebus stopNumber" to 41411.

You can get the stop number a few different ways. Here's a guide: http://onebusaway.org/p/FindingYourStopNumber.action  Except if the driver has neglected to properly reset the ORCA reader for the RFA, in which case the system will error about a passback rather than recognizing the trip as consuming a transfer. ...in which case the Bus Driver says "eh, dumb system" and you get off anyway. I hate that you can't use yor orca balance to pay for more than one fare per ride The ORCA site says you can if you tell the driver you
are paying for x  number of people, but I've never tried it I have seen it been done before. before you scan your card you announce that you would like to do just that to the driver. Really? That's awesome! I have an Orca card and when my boyfriend and I want to visit downtown he has to pay. I will see if that works but since mine is a card issued through an employer my card might have some restrictions and may not let me do it. It wouldn't hurt to try it though.
