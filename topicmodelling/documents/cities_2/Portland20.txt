It can take a person in a wheelchair nine hours to get an Uber during weekdays in Portland  If you use a wheelchair and have Medicaid, you have a Non-Emergent Medical Transportation (NEMT) benefit, so if you are needing transport for a doctor's appointment or getting a prescription, call your health plan or American Medical Response. Free trip. So in other words, it's more efficient than Trimet's LIFT service Makes me want to sign up with my van and help some people out!  > it’s difficult for Uber to compete with that demand [for accessible vans].

Or, in other words, shit starts to get real expensive when you have to obey accessibility laws. It's almost like that's exactly why Uber is so much cheaper than a cab... we *literally* got Uber a couple weeks ago and people are already bitching. wheelchair access is not exactly a defining sales point of Uber or Lyft.

I don't know anyone that owns a wheelchair-lift van, do you? Then how could you expect Uber to have very many wheelchair-accessible vans at the ready? There are other services for wheelchair accessible vehicles, many interoperating with healthcare benefit programs.\

>“They admit that they have no capacity to meet our need, so I wasn’t surprised,” said Joe VanderVeer,  former chairman of Portland’s Commission on Disabilities. 

A "need" was not suddenly created by Uber or Lyft coming to Portland. What, people in wheelchairs never went anywhere before a month ago? Obviously people with disabilities need ways to get around (which already exist) but this is really whiny behavior While ideologically I'm not super comfortable with forcing this on Uber, I think I have to side with the city.

City code is pretty clear here. " At least 10 percent of every taxi company fleet must be wheelchair accessible. " While distinct from a taxi company in most ways, in this instance, it's a fair description of Uber.

The fix is pretty obvious for uber.... incentivize wheelchair van owners to sign up. Pay them 1.5x, or double, (and maybe relax vehicle age restrictions) or whatever it takes to bring the overall number of drivers up to 10%. Either pass the cost on locally to all PDX users or take the hit and absorb it nationally.  The contract thing is clearly a "fuck you" from uber at worst, and at best a bandaid.  > But while the couple has proposed the idea to Uber, they have yet to figure out how to make it work. They have concerns about whether Uber’s collision coverage would be adequate for their van, which is worth about $80,000. And the company doesn’t yet have a system for letting private drivers like Pam use its app to provide wheelchair-accessible rides. 

And this is the real problem.  Uber apparently isn't even trying to make this work right now.  I certainly hope that changes.  But Uber fixes all problems!  My athletes foot is gone and my erections have never been stronger. Oh First Transit. You fucked up the UK railways, now you're fucking shit up here too. You mean... Uber rode into the city with promises of improving mobility for disabled people as a wedge, and then reneged? Shocking! Who could have predicted such a benevolent benevolent company would do such a thing... This is a none-problem. If Uber wasn't available or didn't exist, it would take forever for a person on a wheel chair to get an Uber ride. Unless the presence of Uber somehow makes people in wheel chairs more in need of transportation, then it's still a net gain for everybody. Mandating equal service from private companies, especially a company whose service isn't providing rides but coordinating paid ride shares between individuals isn't helping disabled people. Why am I not surprised? So? It's an unregulated private service with no accountability.  So don't use fucking uber. If you don't like something or it doesn't work for you then don't use it. You don't need to get things shut down or taken away because an individual had a bad experience. Further demonstration that the profit motive shafts those not as economically advantaged #profitUberalles  I support Uber but if they are not providing adequate wheelchair service with what they agreed to then they need to do better. People will use this as an argument and say, "see this is why we shouldn't have Uber" but that's not how anyone should feel at this point.

It's something that can and should change once the kinks are worked out. Additionally this is one person's experience. Did he have issues with the app perhaps and his phone? We need more than one anecdote and case study to draw a definitive conclusion.

It won't negate ride share as a concept though. That's here to stay, Uber et al is only going to add options for people in wheelchairs, not hinder them so let's retain that perspective first and foremost. Or Metrowest. They do more non emergent medical transportation than amr. I'd be surprised if anyone with a long-term disability didn't already know about this benefit. The thing is, there are a lot more places people need to go besides doctor's appointments. that said, what uber is doing is illegal. Exactly my thought. And notice how quickly Uber will fix that issue vs LIFT shitting its pants on a regular basis.*
*Yes, Uber & Tri-Met's LIFT are very different, and LIFT has limitations like out-of-date, mis-managed dispatch, and is grossly underfunded - Maybe it's time to change that? According to the article, UBER is contracting with another company for wheelchair accessible vehicles and UBER itself has no way for individuals with those vehicles to list their rides as wheelchair accessible. See, this is the ACTUAL market benefit of companies like Uber existing. Now regular people with the ways but not the means can help out in an official way. Everybody wins Uber's entire premise is profitability by skirting regulations and laws in place to make the public safer.

That is their ENTIRE fucking business model.  Don't pay regulation fees, licensing, insurance, etc... and make money in that margin with the advantage it gives you on competition.

I wish people could just be honest about this.  Let's just all stop bullshitting and agree to let go of the BS and just start having an honest discussion about his from this point forward. Yeah people who are disabled, quit yer bitchin'....

For real though, some of you with black vans need to see this as a business opportunity. Swag that shit out and make it luxury wheelchair limo service. Yet another example of how Uber can only operate if they fail to follow laws and regulations. It's super-easy to undercut your competition when you break the law and cheat. what are the federal ADA laws concerning disabled accessibility in transport vehicle services, I wonder?

**edit** that was supposed to be sarcasm - my point was we don't have to wonder about whether uber is required to accommodate disabled customers, we can just look it up ourselves. >_< >I don't know anyone that owns a wheelchair-lift van, do you? 

I don't know anyone that owns a wheelchair-lift van but I do know a company that has had 1.5 billion in venture capital that could easily afford some. 

>Then how could you expect Uber to have very many wheelchair-accessible vans at the ready?

They've had months and months to take care of this. And again, with 1.5 billion in venture capital they could easily re-invest in that area instead of ignoring and disenfranchising a vulnerable portion of our society.

Stop trying to defend a bad company and make excuses for them. >While ideologically I'm not super comfortable with forcing this on Uber ...

seriously? what the fuck. Surprised this username just started appearing. Can we be friends? We're already neighbors! Better than the reverse! but taxis are perfect! If only they had done something similar just recently, we might have seen it coming... Uber is competing with companies who are require to provide wheelchair services.  > If Uber wasn't available or didn't exist, it would take forever for a person on a wheel chair to get an Uber ride.

According to the article, it takes about 35 minutes.

But you're right, Uber certainly isn't helping disabled people.   So you are also ok with the Gresham people not baking the cake, or you're a libertarian only when it personally suits you? Because of that terrible accident that left you with the inability to be surprised anymore.   it's actually a regulated service under our current legal system. Yes, wheelchair users can just not use the service unavailable to them. Or you know, Uber is required to provide this type of service by law. So let's just ban uber, if we don't like it and it doesn't fit in with our laws in society then let's just ban it. You don't need it, we have Taxi's and we can use them even if some individuals had a bad experience with them. Nobody is forcing us to allow them in the city. How is any other cab service not profit driven?  Physical disability does not equate economic disadvantage.

Uber is a private car service designed for people who can afford it- I don't think anyone is trying to hide or argue that. > this is one person's experience. Did he have issues with the app perhaps and his phone? We need more than one anecdote and case study to draw a definitive conclusion.

Did you read the article?  It wasn't anything to do with any phone or app issues the guy might've had:

"The contractor Uber works with to provide wheelchair vans, First Transit, has no drivers working on the Uber platform during the day on weekdays, and has just one van driver working on call from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. 

On weekends, the numbers are a bit better — Uber and First Transit have three vans available, though again, they only appear to provide service in the evenings. 

“Uber does not own any vehicles, so we are reliant upon existing providers in the market in order to help provide that service,” said Brooke Steger, Uber’s general manager for the Northwest. “Fundamentally, there’s a problem, because we have not been able to find supply during the day.” There's that term again: "ride share". "Ride share" is carpooling to work or renting your car to someone else (maybe). 

Uber is not "ride share". Uber is deregulated taxi service. Their profitability hinges on ducking and worming their way out of the rules that the other transportation providers have to play by.

 > It won't negate ride share

It's not sharing if you are paying for it. I drive for a medical transport company, and since the first of the year I've given rides to dozens of people who either didn't qualify, or didn't know they qualified, for NEMT until recently. It's amazing how poorly informed many of these people are (and not for lack of trying, either). > And notice how quickly Uber will fix that issue

I hope they will, but the Uber exec's vague, hedging comments certainly didn't make me optimistic.  It won't take them very long at all to make an update.  Fuck cabbies,  nothing but a bunch of cunts from my experience.  Now they aren't bitching about downtown only fares.   In the past they would just tell you "no" because they felt the trip was too short.   Now they are begging for the fares.   

Many have attempted to overcharge intoxicated passengers (I have experienced this first hand when a guy tried to say the cab fare was "per person"), they acted like you were a burden because you weren't going to the airport or outside of downtown,  were rude as fuck.... this uber situation could NOT have come sooner.   

Anyone experienced in cabs downtown understands this.  Sure there are a few great guys and gals working the cabs,  but they are rare.   I'm amazed cabbies have held this racket for so long.  

Also,  anyone who understands how the licensing to pick up at the airport or downtown works, in terms of understanding what it takes to get the approval and licensing, would quickly realize a few cab companies held the monopoly on these areas.  They didn't give a shit because nobody could stop them,  until now.  

 Unless you're in a wheelchair  >Uber's entire premise is profitability by skirting regulations and laws in place to make the public safer.

YES, why are people ok with this? What if some other industry started doing this would people be as supportive? NO. We shouldn't encourage this fuckery. Lyft/Uber cover insurance. Even with cheaper fares, the drivers end up making significantly more than they would driving a cab due to all the regulatory fees, etc... Average yearly income for a cab driver in the US is roughly $20k.

Edit: spelling I think you are a little worked up about this. in my opinion Uber is great - its more convenient and cheaper than a taxi, and often cleaner. Uber is based on drivers using their own cars after inspection and maybe only a few of them have electric wheel chair ramps. Thats more transportation options that DO have wheelchair options than before, even if its only one. I know a few drivers, including my brother, and they love it for extra cash. I don't see why people are up in arms about this.  It's almost as if taxi companies have lobbied regulations that make it so that only their pockets can get filled Then just don't use Uber?  I've been considering doing just this, but I honestly don't know if I could find enough of a market to justify purchasing the vehicle. I've been thinking a lot about this. Esp considering robot cars in the near future. How/how long until automation and or direct to consumer options feed niche markets? I have two dogs and love going to the river, so I have a smartcar. Car sharing? Off hour job ubers? Will automated cars just cater to the intels & nikes? Sorry so fragmented, just off work, gtg to bed.  lol, these are the kinds of people who would outlaw the car because the horse and buggy 'works just fine'!

Dont try to stop innovation, just get out of the way if you are too much of a dumbass to jump aboard.  Man, if only there were some way of searching for information on the internet, then we could answer that question.

EDIT: Because I'm not a total hypocrite. Here's the answer to your question (which was the number one hit on google for "ada taxi requirements": https://www.tlpa.org/news/adanotice.pdf But seriously, I was able to find the answer to your question with two mouse clicks and zero typing:

http://www.fta.dot.gov/civilrights/12325.html I could be mistaken but doesn't uber own zero vehicles of any kind? It feels like giving up on the notion that we should have a city where a disabled person can afford to live somewhere that personal motorized point to point transportation doesn't need to be a human right. I agree it needs to be done, hence the rest of that comment, but I just wish that it didn't have to be.  Benson Bubbler. I used to drink from you.

Then I saw a homeless man using you as a bath.

Then I saw a lady wash off her dog in you.

Never again. Fungus erection? That makes sense. How realistic is it that these companies won't be able to compete or that they'll cease to exist? Do those companies benefit from government oversight and protection, other than the government protecting their transportation monopoly (that's not quite the right word, what is it called when a group of companies collectively control an industry/service? A syndicate? Idk).

My basic feeling is still the same. If the state wants to use private companies to provide public service, they should incentive rather than enforce. I don't think you understood my sentence. I'm mostly a libertarian all around. I'm pretty sure those people you're referring too use public water, public utilities, public roads, etc... the fact of the matter is that 'private' brick and mortar businesses rely heavily on infrastructure paid for by taxes, so it seems rational that the business owners prerogative should be limited by the public will when there practices are deemed dangerous to the public interest. If the whole system gave more power to individuals, then I would trust the market to deal with people who can't keep up with public sentiment. There is no need to act like that now uber has been present for a month here people that need a wheel chair are now suddenly unable to get around. I much prefer uber to taxis. I've never had a bad experience with uber in any city, very much unlike cabs. We should change our laws to fit a new and better way of handling taxis instead of pushing them away in order to protect antiquated laws. I just mean that clearly services have to be tightly regulated, or else... This.

Edit: Downvotes should be reserved for meaningless comments, not just because of political disagreement  It's a private car service that threatens a regulated service with all the privileges and none of the burdens. So they're not a public accommodation? They could refuse to serve any group they deem unworthy of their private services for any reason and that wouldn't be a problem? you mean the rules that other transportation providers have manipulated and monopolized for decades? 8 users have asked for a wheelchair ride. As the article states the other wheelchair providers get contracts for medical transport which has HUGE payback from medicalcare. (ill buy a car that does this if you let me charge 100's for a trip to the hospital.)
Its about supply and demand. The POS taxi companies want to maintain the status quo  so are looking for any excuse to avoid competition.  I do think that the offer to provide some income for these people with vans already would be a great idea. Its probably something they havent thought of before .... At least UBER is willing to make changes, unlike the taxi services. That's a problem across all the social welfare programs. What cab company are you using?

If you get in anything but a radio cab that's on you.  I've had good experiences 95% of the time in radio cabs. From looking at your comment history, you are an unpleasant person that particularly loves to insult people along sexist and ablest lines; in short, you're an asshole. So the reason why cabbies treat you like shit is because you're an asshole and people treat assholes in the way that they deserve to be treated. 

The only reason that Uber drivers are nice to you is because the system has been set up in such a way that they'll lose their job if they call you out for being an asshole, so they're forced to suck it up and take your bullshit. >nothing but a bunch of cunts from my experience

ahhh yesss, nothing like some casual misogyny to bolster your point.  How so?  Now there are more options for you - there are still taxis and LIFT.  Now there's Uber as well.   Because nearly all of the regulations that Uber is busting have little/nothing to do with safety and **everything to do with protecting cab companies.**

Cab companies have known for about 60 years that their business was vulnerable to any schmo with a car pulling over to make a few bucks if a fellow citizen walking down the street stood at the curb with their hand in in the air to hail them. So, they started telling nightmare stories about random savages posing as for-hire drivers looking to rape and kill people. The only solution to these endless horrors that could possibly work was the creation of an elaborate regulatory scheme to ensure the safety of the public.

Sound a little too dramatic? Read the 6th paragraph up from the bottom on this Oregonian article - a Radio Cab driver, in an open public meeting, asked people how they felt about letting an Uber driver run around raping a 9 year old child:

http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2015/04/portland_makes_uber_and_lyft_l.html

Some basic taxi regulations are fair and common sense; the vehicle should be insured, the driver should be licensed, a background check should be performed, and the fair should be upfront. Uber was ticking all of those boxes well before they ever came to Portland, because they are self-evident needs for any business. Virtually all the "debate" was focused on bureaucratic paperwork padding that is designed primarily to protect crony taxi drivers from competition, not little girls from getting raped by those goblin gypsy cab companies. Because the cab cartel got bloated, lazy, and expensive for the consumer.

For god's sake, there is a reason NYC cab medallions were being sold for over $1 million each - because there was no competition and the owner of a medallion could make much more than $1 million during the lifetime of the medallion. 

Uber cars are cheap, clean, and usually newer and in better shape than my car. That's why we're ok with it. Except, as the article points out, their insurance doesn't appear to cover (or not sufficiently cover) wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  Which is a real problem.  > fairs

**fare** Because Uber is breaking the law. Should we ignore that fact? > maybe only a few of them have electric wheel chair ramps. Thats more transportation options that DO have wheelchair options than before, even if its only one.

Did you read the article?  The problem is that for huge portions of the week, there are _zero_ Uber vehicles that are wheelchair accessible.  And for other large portions of the week, there is exactly one, for the whole city.  That's a problem, but even moreso, it's a violation of the law.  The city granted Uber (and other similar services) the right to operate here with the stipulation that they follow certain very watered-down regulations.  And they can't even do that.  Still don't see why people are up in arms about this? I hope your at least getting paid for slinging that horseshit. And your response to child slavery is don't own one, right? Your claim is that it's perfectly all right to ignore the law if its done in the service of "innovation". 

Is this an accurate representation of your position? If not, why not? Can you read that website for me and tell me what it says? I could be mistaken but doesn't Uber have 1.5 Billion in venture capital to buy its own vehicles and be complaint with ADA laws? Not so much that it's a human right... I mean, access to laser pointers aren't a human right, but ADA regulations exist so that people who need a ramp to get into the laser pointer store aren't shut off from the economy. Because potentially serving a small segment of the population isn't enough incentive otherwise to install a ramp. transportation and mobility around the city seems like an important thing that needs to be available to *everyone*. that's why the ada even exists. It's okay, they say the copper is antimicrobial. I'm pretty confident I did.  If they can raise $2.8 billion in VC they can figure something out with a better turn around time than a month. Or else what? Uber is an option not the only form of transit in the city. How many people have handicap accessible personal vehicles?!   you mean like taxi's do now? they turn down service all the time. Flag a cab down, if the fare isnt far enough they will leave you there.   > the rules that other transportation providers have manipulated and monopolized for decades

Lol, you think they want to provide rides to handicapped riders? Each one of those lift vans is a $30k+ investment (compared to the typical ex-police Crown Vic that they buy used at auction for a few grand tops). Once a van's converted it doesn't make sense to use it for other / regular passengers because it's just wear & tear on that very-expensive vehicle that the law *requires* to be available for people who need it. So you've got service mandated by the government, a big overhead / upfront investment that's required to run a cab company at all in most cities. But it's ultimately for good, because anyone should be able to get a ride for hire. I strongly believe in that.

Uber just doesn't give a shit-- it's a service that gets ahead by shafting the disabled, the elderly and poor, and it's pretty much exactly what the cab companies were before we began regulating them 60+ years ago-- when you couldn't get a ride if you lived in the wrong neighborhood or had the wrong skin color.

Allowing Uber to skirt these protections establishes a two-tierd system that heavily favors Uber, who already has billions to back its business. I call it what it is: unfair and a force that is actively working *against* equality in our society. I'm in San Diego right now, and there are currently 7 vehicles active that can accept wheelchairs, and a 13 minute wait. So yes I think if the demand is there then more vehicles will come available. I always gotta wonder what compels someone to dig through comment histories.   Did I offend and conflict with your world view?  I take it you are angry at both my Sanders remark,  and you are probably pro cab union and didn't like that I said "cunt".  

What I am very impressed with was your complete lack of rebuttal, besides straw man attack based on a brief view of a comment history.   Nothing says compelling argument quite like nothing of substance.    What does his/her past posts have to do with the points made? Like your first response was to go mining for adhom material? On a side note,  had I said "dicks" I guarantee you wouldn't have commented anything relating to gender.  Let your gender bias and double standard prevail SJW.

Also, very compelling argument. Picking a word out of an argument as opposed to arguing the topic... just brilliant.   I take it you go to public university.   PSU or PCC? lol The SJW in you is strong.  You poor victim of my terminology.   You should sue and maybe slam me on your blog.  No, there's not Uber, as the article clearly demonstrated. Hold on . . . the article pretty clearly explains that there is _not_ Uber as well.  I hope they fix that soon, but for now, the much-maligned cab companies are better for wheel-chair-bound folks. Did you read the article? Between 9am and 5pm Uber doesn't have wheelchair accessible vehicles   > "Virtually all the "debate" was focused on bureaucratic paperwork padding that is designed primarily to protect crony taxi drivers from competition, not little girls from getting raped by those goblin gypsy cab companies."

Bullshit.  This entire thread is about the requirement to have 10% of your fleet be handicapped accessible.  The "debate" you want to throw quotes around is real, and no amount of denial or talk about it protecting 'cabbie cronyism' is accurate. Not only that, your idea of what constitutes fair insurance or background checks is lacking.  There are droves of accurate articles about the shortcomings of those check boxes.

Regulations such as ([16.40.300](http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?&a=529509&c=28593)) are the ones that Uber have consistently skirted, or like the check boxes, have done poorly with no accountability.  These are not meant to protect cab companies; they are meant to protect classes of people with limited access.  Should handicapped people just choose businesses with ramps or elevators?  Awesome....

[A driver hits my car, now I'm fucked because your idea of coverage leaves a gap](https://www.policygenius.com/blog/uber-lyft-and-other-rideshare-drivers-now-have-insurance-options/)

[Here's an example of the 'quality' background checks for drivers](https://gigaom.com/2014/12/10/heres-the-problem-with-the-way-uber-vets-drivers/) Oh my god those cabbies are whiny. Sorry people prefer clean, personal vehicles, cheap fair, and the easy interface of the app! I just used Uber last weekend to get from Beaverton to downtown and it was great! Knowing the cost of a regular taxi (plus the time it'd take to call, find me and pick me up), I wouldn't have gone through the trouble, but Uber makes fun nights out in Portland with my friend even more enticing since I don't have to drive. Those cabbies are salty, and I really don't feel bad for them if they are going to heckle and spit on those who like Uber. the literal definition of tl;dr i thought we didn't have a medallion system in portland... Feel like we went 0 to 60 there pretty quickly. That's a bit of a jump.  "If it doesnt pick my pocket or break my leg"

Uber came about because of smart phones, and whatever laws you think they are breaking are either bullshit laws written by lobbyist and bureaucrats, or  they are not breaking any laws and you just dont know what you are talking about.

Uber is not getting any of my taxes so it does not have to force someone to provide a service they do not want to sign up for.  The city must provide services for the disabled and does so just fine.  no reason to try and go after individuals giving rides to other consenting adults who have reached out to them specifically for a transfer of goods and services. 

Was I breaking a law when I charged kids on my block for rides to and from high school?  What if I put up a piece of paper telling people they could ask me for rides?  At what point am I breaking a law?

Or just re-read what OP comment said.

"we literally got Uber a couple weeks ago and people are already bitching. wheelchair access is not exactly a defining sales point of Uber or Lyft.
I don't know anyone that owns a wheelchair-lift van, do you? Then how could you expect Uber to have very many wheelchair-accessible vans at the ready? There are other services for wheelchair accessible vehicles, many interoperating with healthcare benefit programs.\
“They admit that they have no capacity to meet our need, so I wasn’t surprised,” said Joe VanderVeer, former chairman of Portland’s Commission on Disabilities.
A "need" was not suddenly created by Uber or Lyft coming to Portland. What, people in wheelchairs never went anywhere before a month ago? Obviously people with disabilities need ways to get around (which already exist) but this is really whiny behavior" Complying with regulations would undercut Uber's entire business model. You really like that point, huh? They are compliant with ADA laws - many precedents to prove that. 

http://mic.com/articles/10560/federal-court-rules-new-york-taxis-in-compliance-with-americans-with-disabilities-act Why would a company that doesn't buy vehicles of any kind need to buy vehicles to be compliant with ADA?

I don't support über in any way, but your argument is, in a word, stupid. Should AirBnb be required to purchase accessible apartments if they happen to have the money in the bank? A cab is not an Uber ride. The cad ride in no way becomes less available because there are also Uber rides available. That was the point of my sentence. Only tangentially related, I recent saw a modified Scion xB with rear airbag suspension and the entire back end just drops to the floor and this tiny ramp flips out so the driver can back their wheelchair right out. It was amazing! I'm hopeful they're more affordable than the classic modified minivan, it seemed like an  excellently executed concept. Regulations are also there to protect the minority.  Your rhetorical question is a great example of that.   But they can't turn down service for any member of a protected class for no reason other than membership in the protected class.   Really? By shafting the disabled, poor and elderly? A. In most areas with an established uber prescense, lift accessible vehicles are moderately easy to get. Uber just started in Portland, and is on a trial period, so it's utterly shocking they've not dumped millions into vans they may not be able to use in 3 months.

The poor? You think taxis accepted fares in traditionally minority neighborhoods? You just not have very many friends of color. I fail to see how cheaper, more responsive rides that also provide secondary income options hurt the poor. About the only time uber is more expansive and less reliable are days when you can't get taxis for hours. 

The elderly? Please. My mom is 72 and has used uber 3 times to get to grocery, and has saved $30 vs. what taxis had been costing her.

You're delusional or a shill for a group that has basically set their own rules. Now they're being punished for their chronically bad business practices and manipulation. Getting a taxi sucked in Portland before uber. Sorry, but it's true. Is uber perfect? Hell no, but is it providing a much better service to 90%+ if the market, and improving, yes. >Nothing says compelling argument quite like nothing of substance.

This is hilarious. Because context exists. People have agendas and experiences and it is important to view them as part of a larger whole. 

As much as people want to act like its not true, arguments don't exist inside of some sort of vacuum. 

For instance, if someone regularly comments on places like /r/coontown or /r/whitepower, I am not going to accept their opinion on race relations in Baltimore as being valid.  >I take it you go to public university. PSU or PCC?

there is almost no way this would be more incorrect both in terms of geography and type of institution. If it's truely just a ride sharing service, and they just introduce people that need rides to people that have rides, I don't see the need for any "accommodation", except having their website be accessible to blind and deaf people. I agree that any company that provides transport services of any kind should be handicapped accessible, but you (unwittingly) cut right to the heart of the matter by noting that the regulations require 10% of the fleet be so equipped...

Where does that number come from? Was a rigorous analysis of the actual service demand from handicapped folks performed? Is 10% of the population dealing with mobility issues that would require the use of an accessible vehicle?

10% sounds too much like the sort of nice, round number that is not rooted in any sort of reality, cooked up by regulators with no data and a desire to present something that sounded "about right."

Let's face it, the real reason cab companies are harping on the accessibility point is precisely because they know Uber's business model is intrinsically ill suited to delivering on this service niche. For Uber to comply with higher insurance mandates or more vigorous background checks is a simple matter of increasing coverage and spending more - easily calculated business expenses that can be factored into the overall financial model. The logistics of getting accessible vehicles on the roads however, is **way** more complicated for Uber. You think the cab companies don't know this?

As to the background check and insurance hand wringing... it's just that, harpy chicken little hand wringing. Uber has now been operating for years, in many cities, with millions of customers taking tens of thousands of rides a day. Are we seeing Uber drivers raping 9 year olds? Are riders going bankrupt after accidents because of a lack of coverage?

Nope. Sure, there are isolated incidents like there are with any activity at the scale of Uber, but the rates of problems seem to be about the same as you find with those highly regulated taxi cab companies, making all the arguments against Uber (in this regard) unfounded. Just read the first sentence, dipshit. Dumb responses garner dumb responses.  uber came around because people are just pissed off enough at bad taxi service to let an illegal business roll into town and undercut the competition. This is the dumbest thing I've read today. Congrats! We aren't talking about two guys in a garage with $50,000 dollars of start up cash here, that probably deserve some leeway when planning out something in their business venture.

You have 1.4 billion dollars, along with an already incoming revenue, there really is no excuse to alienate a portion of the public when expanding into a new market. There is absolutely no reason to defend and make up excuses for them. That is a shit ton of money for a company, as it has already been pointed out, doesn't even have to buy vehicles as an overhead.

If you want to make excuses and pardon the lack of social responsibility of a business that has the funds and the time to correct this, by all means please do.  You are wrong.

Here's the part that you don't understand about that article. The lawsuit in question only clarified whether taxis are public accommodations under federal law, states are still 100% able to classify them as public accommodations. Which is the case in a lot of places, just meaning the jurisdiction for enforcing compliance is at the state rather than federal level. 

There are many precedents to prove that, such as the Oregon Revised Statutes.
 
http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/659A.400 But let's just ignore that while that ruling was in appeals NY City made itself more complaint and settled.

New York City has reached a milestone agreement to regulate yellow taxis such that at least half of those vehicles will be wheelchair-accessible within six years. 

http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2013/12/06/taxi-settlement-increase-accessible-cabs.html Yes to even air BnB. If you are going to be a business, you are going to be complaint with the law even if you don't own the franchises you moderate. If you can't do what everybody else has been doing for the last 50 years with your business model, then it is a shitty business model.

I don't care if they own the houses or apartments or don't, they don't get to have the convenient excuse of, "it isn't our problem, we don't own or build the houses". Yeah ADA is expensive for everyone, so yes they should be building or buying places to have 10% or whatever the number is to become compliant.

If AirBnB can't do it and make a profit, then step aside go out of business and let somebody else do it but you aren't going to say your service of saving money on vacations is open to everyone but the disabled. uber is failing to follow the law as a public service. that's all there is to it. > A cab is not an Uber ride

Only in the sense that Uber apparently doesn't believe they have to follow the same regulations as all other companies that provide rides for money. [Here's an example](http://www.fminow.com/scion-xb-rear-and-side-entry-wheelchair-accessible-car). It's not cheaper than a minivan.

Not sure what happened to [Kenguru](http://www.kenguru.com/) but they never got going. You are funny.  So you needed to check his tribe affiliation before attacking. Gotcha.
 >I agree that any company that provides transport services of any kind should be handicapped accessible, but you (unwittingly) cut right to the heart of the matter by noting that the regulations require 10% of the fleet be so equipped...
Where does that number come from? Was a rigorous analysis of the actual service demand from handicapped folks performed? Is 10% of the population dealing with mobility issues that would require the use of an accessible vehicle?

The burden of proof is on you as to whether that number is some kind of arbitrary number.  If you want to prove cronyism in regard to 10%, you have to discover that trail and show that it exists.

>For Uber to comply with higher insurance mandates or more vigorous background checks is a simple matter of increasing coverage and spending more - easily calculated business expenses that can be factored into the overall financial model. The logistics of getting accessible vehicles on the roads however, is way more complicated for Uber. 

You bring up the exact point that everyone is trying to make:  Uber is breaking the law to profit across the world because it has the financial capacity to do so.  I'd like to believe we live in a society that has a contract between the people and government which provides laws--laws that can be changed through a process called democracy.  It's one of the great things about being American.  You on the other hand seem to have the idea that money should do as it pleases without first using it's free speech to influence lawmakers.  If there is no disadvantage to society, or no risk, then those laws will change, but business should not break the laws for the sake of profit, especially when those laws are there to protect the classes of people who are at the greatest risk. I think the argument is that Uber doesn't count as a taxi service... If it isn't, then I guess this is all fine and if we don't like it we need to change regulations to handle this new kind of "crowd sourced" service. 

But by my reading, Uber counts as a taxi service so it has to be ADA compliant. They save money by ignoring this and other regulations so they can charge less and outcompete cab companies. As I see it, its exactly the same as China being able to make cheaper shit because they don't have to bother with anything like the EPA or OSHA, they can externalize all kinds of costs.

Uber's a great idea but if you're going to provide a cab service you have to follow cab laws. Why should anyone listen to what you say, when it's clear that all you're going to do is trash Uber?

Thank you.  If Uber wasn't using a different business model, one that doesn't work like traditional cab services, then why has it been so popular and created such a stir. Just expecting every business to kow tow to what's come before doesn't make sense and works against innovation. Unless the presence of Uber drivers actually makes it harder for disabled people to get around, I say leave then alone. Why regulate in advance of actual problems? The only arguments I've heard on the pro-regulation side of that they want to protect taxi companies (why?) and that the government, as usual, wants a cut. Thank you for the compliment. 

You see how much nicer things are when you act politely? Do you think context matters? My view of the matter is *far* more pragmatic than you are giving me credit for.

Yes, I think Uber should provide service to the handicapped folks. Yes, I think that there is a general responsibility to do so.

Where our views diverge is that I think companies like Uber and Lyft (or any startup) needs to be given some runway to get the business off-the-ground before we demand that they comply fully with these laws. Clearly, Uber is making effort towards these ends, but their ability to add this capacity is limited by a lack of vehicles and drivers. If we see Uber abandon handicapped access or if they don't improve, I'll be happy to advocate that they be punished right alongside you.

I know Uber is the big evil overlords with lots of VC backing behind them, and not very popular. I get that, but I also understand the realities of running a business and how difficult doing stuff like adding handicapped access to something like Uber really is. Demanding full accessibility for folks, out of the box, before the rest of the market is developed enough to shoulder the costs is simply impractical.  I think that the argument about whether or not its a *taxi* service is a false canard, it doesn't matter. The relevant statute refer to *transportation* services, not taxi. Uber is clearly a transportation service, regardless of the taxi concept. How is it clear? Because I don't like huge corporations with tons of money disenfranchising a vulnerable portion of our society?

There must have been tons of other information I was providing forth without my knowledge in these posts. Is there a list of all the websites banned somewhere? I haven't seen it and I see tons of bizjournal links on reddit, which is sitewide. Different business model?  Hardly.  The only real difference is that, in most places, they don't have to follow the same regulations the cab companies do, which helps their profit margins.  In theory, they're under the same rules here, but as we can see from this story, even that isn't true. I also would like a grace period for following laws for start up companies in general. Developing nations get to do all kinds of crazy stuff and we have lesser punishments for juvenile defenders, so why not easier regulations for start ups? good point. > disenfranchising

/r/iamverysmart  Not to my knowledge. [There is a subreddit that keeps track](http://www.reddit.com/r/BannedDomains) but it is not ran by the admins and is full of useless shitposts. 

The admins have not made a "show" out of what sites are banned from here because they know that spammers will simply use a different hosting site to spam Reddit with if they know their other site is banned. 

It's annoying, but eh. 

I only point out that bizjournals is banned because it's constantly showing up in our queue and the people who are posting links from there are always never legitimate spammers.

>I see tons of bizjournal links on reddit, which is sitewide.

That's because we have to manually approve them, which most do because it's not a typical shitty no-content site. There is a somewhat serious argument that could be made that it makes a lot of sense to loosen regulation for startups. Part of the reason big businesses stay big is precisely because they *invite* regulation - a large scale enterprise that is generating a lot of cash has a relatively easy time complying with regulations. For them, it is a fixed cost that scales very very easily.

For startups and small businesses, complying with complex or burdensome regulations without that pre-existing business, massive revenue generation or scale is extremely difficult. The net result is that the big companies stay big, while new ideas or new businesses are either unable to start in the space because of the regulatory burden, or the regulatory burden is so large, it hampers their ability to grow.
A lot of folks don't realize that entrenched industries often **beg and lobby** for regulation precisely because they want to use the legislature to keep competition from cropping up. What we are seeing with taxi companies across the country is this sort of situation (it's called "regulatory capture").
And no, that doesn't mean that this is a zero sum game where I'm arguing for zero regulation and I want to turn America into Somalia, but I do think that some smart, pragmatic, regulatory intelligence needs to happen (in a lot of industries) to allow startups and small businesses to compete against entrenched players.  You add so much to the discussion. Wow, you went full douche there.  Was that necessary? You would prefer that people talk all *hurr-durr*? This makes sense, thank you. I prefer it when people use words correctly.  Look up the meaning of the word. And how exactly do you think they used the word incorrectly? 

PROTIP: Disenfranchisement has a broader meaning than simply to do with voting rights. secondary definitions NEVER COUNT.
