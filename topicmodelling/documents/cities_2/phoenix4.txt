Strip Club Closes After Bouncers Kill Off-Duty Firefighter In Parking Lot  'Meathead Bouncer Overreacts to Drunk Patron Mouthing Off, Charged With Murder.'

More at 11.

I get it.  I worked in the bar business and sometimes people can be drunk, obnoxious assholes who you want to punch in the face.  But you're supposed to deescalate the situation, not go full Rambo on someone's ass because they said something you didn't like or even if they inappropriately touched a stripper's tits.

If someone is acting out of line, you 1) cut them off on drinks.  If that doesn't work 2) you politely ask them to leave.  No luck?  3) You push them out the door.  4) Nuclear option: you call the cops.  You can't just beat a guy to death.  I mean the guy had his arm in a brace for fuck's sake.  It's almost akin to starting a fight with a blind man in a wheelchair. Holy shit, I always see the manager working out at my gym. Surprised he would do something shady like that but centerfold has always been a shady place.  For a time about 20 years ago, I went to that place every Friday because our ~~scoutmaster~~ manager would buy us lunch there (but not allow alcohol).   Brooklyn Bedding

Truly no middle man.


Meh, I prefer American furniture  Roommate used to play softball with the firefighter. He was getting ready to have knee surgery as well, so he easily should have been in a wheelchair.  Option 3 can result in death unintentionally (all it takes is hitting your head/turning your neck the wrong way) if you have to get really pushy. If they're being a problem you can't wait on cops to arrive to get them out.

I doubt that's what happened here but just saying it's not all black and white what happens.  Probably haven't seem him recently, I assume. Manager is out on bail. 

Source: was at cfolds the Friday before it closed.  Hah he's at the gym now. Just like the other commenter mentioned, seems like he's out on bail.
