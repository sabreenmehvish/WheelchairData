Relative of Home Care Worker Tosses Elderly Man Out of Wheelchair During Robbery  >Costello and Fusco said they're able to keep "in the know" about their case because Willis is related to someone who provides in-home care to Fusco.

I hope that they are looking for a new company to provide in-home care. So not to in any way diminish how horrible this crime is, but the guy who is accused of committing it is like the made-for-TV caricature of what a crackhead is (think Tyrone Biggums but with a pretty obvious violent streak). 

One time I was walking down Broad St (when I lived downtown) and he approached me asking for money. I said I didn't have any and he said "C'mon man, I'll literally lick the sidewalk if you give me $5." I said no but he licked the sidewalk anyway. And that was it. He just walked away.

Anyway, he's probably snorted that whole $700 away by now.  Yeah are they acting like the two aren't related?
