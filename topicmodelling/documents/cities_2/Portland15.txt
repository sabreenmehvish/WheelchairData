I saw this at Woodstock Goodwill. This thing is crazy, I have never seen anything like it before.  [deleted] A unicycle with training wheel? penny farthing gravity bike. That's a tough sell...

It's like a skateboard! *...But lamer!*

It's a bicycle without all the inconvenience of a seat or being able to go uphill! is it from wheelchair rugby? Someone zoo bomb on it As someone who is accident prone with traumatic brain injury, it looks dangerous. So like an impossible wheel, but with a training wheel? Huh. Sweet wheel, OP. You take it off any sweet jumps? Don't even want to imagine what it would feel like to hit a big ass bump on that thing. Good work identifying the magic wheel. Definitely ridiculous and appropriately donated to the Woodstock Goodwill.  whoa good job...  
  
it's called the "Magic Wheel"...link is to a promo video (with ~~Spanish~~ Portugese text!)...  
  
it's sort of like the non-snow equivalent of skiing  
  
Magic Wheel:skiing as skateboard:snowboarding  
  
I hate skiing, but I want to take a few turns on this thing regardless...preferrably half-drunk and stoned I feel like I can trust this product after seeing footage of people using it for no more than five seconds before a cut. [Here's](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Free-shipping-self-balance-unicycle-small-bicycle-specialized-road-bike-single-wheel-scooter-adult-kick-scooter/1851898_32423177308.html) a similar product for only $746.00! it's *ecological* "Carry it almost everywhere!" this is a good guess More like traumatic groin injury *Portuguese  It was Portuguese. How very unglobal of you! thanks i stand corrected
