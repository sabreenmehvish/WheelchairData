Metro Transit officers won't face charges in wheelchair case   What a bunch of ignorant commenters on that news site...reminds me quite a bit of CNN.  Really makes you appreciate the Reddit crowd. Heh. Well if you notice there's absolutely no discussion here on /r/dc. Given that its way more fun to dogpile the MTA for everything, I'm not sure I can agree with your appreciation for the reddit crowd.  In another r/washingtonDc post you said reddit sucks because no one is commenting on this post.  I came here to see what you had to say.  More of the same.  Just saying, if you want people to start talking about something why not be the person who starts the conversation.   Its not an accident that the only thing we're talking about how people aren't talking about this. There was already a conversation starter. See above. Oh and 3 downvotes. LOL. Like, why? Oh right, see my original theory =) Downvotes are not actually an indication that a redditor is downvoting you.  I had heard at one point that the admins wrote an algorithm to normalize vote levels after there was an influx of new users.
