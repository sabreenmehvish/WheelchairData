Here in Toronto  the high school carpentry courses build wheelchair ramps as a individual student project. Its a part of the 40 hours of required community service per school year, per student. Other classes build stairway hand rails, and reach handles for wheel chair users to get things off store shelves. 

Here all commercial/ retail locations are required to have wheel chair ramps. The most common ones are only 6 to 12 inches high, but it makes it a lot easier to navigate entry.  Typically the ramp is made of plywood, and shaped like a wedge. Low end at the sidewalk end, with the top higher end at the doorway.
