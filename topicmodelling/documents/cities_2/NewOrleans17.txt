Best places to go walking around? My friend and I are running away for a few days and don't have a ton of money. So mostly, we are planning to wander around and eat. What places are best for aimless ambling? Also, I'm on a knee scooter, which is more maneuverable than a wheelchair but smoother is better, generally. 

Thanks for any help that is offered! :) semi related http://i.imgur.com/iepcs4f.gif I think our horrible sidewalks might give you some issues Most of the Quarter's sidewalks were redone prior to the Superbowl. Same for much of the CBD. New curb-cuts and everything.
