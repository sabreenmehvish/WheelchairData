We're a new dating startup launching in NYC. It's kind of like Chatroulette meets OkCupid. You can grab a spot on the beta invite list.  When I was a child, a woman in a wheelchair ran over and killed my Pomeranian puppy. Ever since then, I have had a profound fear of people who use wheelchairs and an even bigger fear that someone I am video chatting with may actually end up having shriveled, non-functioning legs, or worse no legs at all. What preventative measures will you guys have in place to combat handicapped persons who abuse the app by fraudulently misrepresenting themselves as functioning bipeds? I can see the value in video confirming whether the other person generally looks like their photos before any numbers are exchanged, but I wouldn't be interested in the audio--is that step optional? > It's kind of like Chatroulette meets 


Yeah, you didn't use Chatroulette beyond the first week or so it existed, right?

 One of the founders here. Happy to take questions. So it's like a way of finding the people that jack off on chatroulette in real life?  Where do I sign up? Try making a post in /r/startups/ too. wat. I'm ugly.  Can your app hide that? fantastically reddit comment.
