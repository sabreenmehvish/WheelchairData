People who use wheelchairs, what are some of your favorite and least favorite bars in the area, in terms of accessibility?  [deleted] I am not in a wheelchair, but my best friend is. We have had good luck at John Harvards in Harvard square. They have a lift to get people in wheelchairs down/up. We also had good luck at The Cask and Flagon and Boston Beer Works right next to Fenway park. Both are accessible and are very accommodating. Just don't go on a gameday because it will be mobbed.  incoming boston.com article about wheel chair bars...  I don't know much about it, but lamplighter brewing Co. on Broadway in Cambridge is all ground floor. I think they took an old garage and renovated it or something.  Bukowskiâ€™s in Inman Sq is pretty accessible.   Must be rough on him.  Yup, I made that mistake ONCE when my stoned self was completely unaware of the game schedule... LESSON LEARNED. Right between those two bars is Game On which is not elevated although I don't expect the lower level is accessible. For Cask there is a side entrance which is not elevated, was there a ramp out front? For Beer Works there is a ramp from the entrance to the main bar area. In the same area just down the street on Brookline Ave there is Yardhouse which is definitely accessible.

 He just rolls with it... Truth be told I don't remember how we got into The Cask, but it has to have a ramp. My buddy is in a motorized wheelchair that weights around 350 lbs without him in it, so there is no way we lifted him in.  I just double-checked on google maps. The side entrance is ~15 feet from the main entrance and that is not elevated so I'm sure that's where you got it. Very accessible.
