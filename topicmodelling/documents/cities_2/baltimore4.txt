Wheelchair Van Defaced and Angry Note left in Fallston parking lot  Have the van lettered right on the windows:

"WHEELCHAIR RAMP - 2 PARKING SPACES REQUIRED TO OPERATE"

In large reflective lettering. 
Either that or electrify the windshield wipers while parked so these narcissistic asshats get electrocuted when they lift it up to put their asshole note under it.  This note was left on my mother's handicap van at the Texas Roadhouse in Fallston. This isn't the first time something like this has happened to her. She is a wheelchair bound paraplegic with many other health issues on top of that. It takes a great deal of effort for her to get up and get ready to go somewhere. It's an ordeal that takes hours just to get out of the house to run errands or go places. She's a strong woman, and my personal hero, and she deserves better than this. So does every other person in her situation.

Here is what she had to say about it...

"After picking up my sister from BWI and meeting her husband at Texas Roadhouse, we had dinner. Parking was not available for my handicap van with ramp, so I took 2 spaces so that I could get in and out. When we came out this letter was on my van. The van has been keyed, dented, and spat on because of the space I sometimes need for my ramp.

"More times than not I just stay home. So, to whomever left this message, maybe you should take a good look at the van, notice the handicap tags, wheelchair on side windows and sticker. I am hurt, frustrated, and angry, but I will not stop appearing in public with my special needs. Please pass this on...maybe the individual who wrote this missive will be able to understand why I parked as I did."

The problems she faces are ones I never considered before seeing her struggle. It's not something we often come face to face with, and I think people need to be more aware. Yes, many handicap tags are used fraudulently, and many of the people using them even rightfully are still able to walk and frequently park in single spaces, but the wheelchairs are different. The ramps have to extend out, their mobility issues are deeper than just aches and pains. It's not an easy life, and people should be aware and not make things even harder for them.
 I have a disabled older brother with cerebral palsy who walks on crutches. When I take him out to go to the movies or eat it has become almost impossible to find a handicap permitted spot; they always seem to be full. I find the issue is an increasing amount of people are getting permanently disabled permits for being old or fat, and the population is only getting older. There really aren't that many people with crutches or wheelchairs, the ones who really need it, for the amount of handicap spots allocated (which would be plenty for that population).

The amount of spaces per parking lot or the amount of permits being given out needs to be seriously reevaluated. If it was up to me I wouldn't be giving them out like candy, which seems to be the problem from my perspective. First off, whoever did this is clearly in the wrong and probably has some mental instabilities. Hopefully the cameras can help pinpoint whoever this is, and I hope you filled a police report. 

With that said, I don't believe that handicap tags excuse you from double parking. I am not sure if it is against the law of not - that can vary based off of the local laws, private vs public property, etc. But if you are parking in a normal space you should abide by the same rules as everyone else. Why not drop your mom off at the door and then park the car ? If you are dropping off and picking up that should be totally acceptable. Any reasons given for double parking in a normal space fall into the same territory , regardless of handicap , huge vehicle, or just not wanting to get your door dinged. If you park in a standard space abide by the rules of the standard space. They will think their reasons for double parking are just as important as yours, and while a moral perspective will draw a pretty bold and easy to read line, double parking is double parking no matter how you look at it.

You could also take it up with the ownership of the Texas Road house to see if they are willing to designate more handicap spaces. 

Best of luck to you catching the person who did this. It's a shame that so many able bodied people are selfish pricks who only care about the disabled when they feel like they're getting some kind of "perk" for having a disability.

"I dun wanna walk to the story why can *iiiiiii* park close???" what a weird target for someone's hostility... Urge to kill rising... [deleted] [removed] Doesn't help. 

My friend is wheelchair bound and people park next to him all the time. Yes even when he is in the handicap space, they park in the striped off space next to it.  I prefer the latter tbqh [deleted] If you're too fucking stupid to notice the handicap tags, the wheelchair  stickers, and the fact that it's a big ass van, you're too fucking stupid to be driving.  And if you're going to leave a shitty note on someone's car, you better stop and make sure you have a *damn* good reason for doing it.

I'm sorry you and your mom have to deal with this.  There are a lot of ridiculous hillbillies in that area who don't have two brain cells to rub together.  In the end, they're the ones who need to learn manners and compassion.  At least your mom isn't a total shit-lord who leaves shitty notes to undeserving people. Here's hoping that walking shitbag gets found and fined.  > There really aren't that many people with crutches or wheelchairs, the ones who really need it,

I have neither crutches nor a wheelchair. But I do have MS. My immune system has left lots of little areas of my brain scarred and useless, including one are the size of a half dollar right on top of my cerebellum. I don't look like I 'really need it', but trust me, I do.

I'm 35. I look like I am in good health. I walk pretty fast for a handicapped person (if I walk slowly I am at a higher risk of falling because my gait is linked to my proprioception and balance - standing still, like in a line or something, is even worse. You'll know it's me when you see me because i'm either shuffling my feet or just sitting down in the middle of the grocery line or whatever). I broke my ankle three years ago walking slowly across a room. I don't look like I need the space. But I do need it.

Don't fall into the trap of assuming that the only people who need handicapped spaces are visibly handicapped. I haven't used my crutch since my last relapse a few years ago, and in that time frame I have been accosted half a dozen times by people who accuse me of not really needing the space. I had a problem at company next to a company I moonlighted at so many times that I marched into their office, went straight for the owner's office (he was the one that was doing it) slammed the films of my most recent MRI down on his desk and pointed out all of the brain damage I have. I forced him to look at every single speck on the sheets. He had just assumed that I only parked in the handicapped space because it was my family's company. 

"You don't LOOK disabled!" Over and over that was his excuse, that's what their excuse always is. Well you don't LOOK like a walking talking MRI machine, so you don't get to make the call - that's my usual response. I agree. It's sometimes hard to say who should and shouldn't be getting the permits, and I've been humbled before when someone who appears fine has a hidden disability and needs the spot. But you're right, getting it just because you're old isn't right.

Maybe there should be different levels of handicap tag and space, like spaces only for wheelchairs and such, and then spots that are handicap but don't need so much additional space on either side for people who just need to be close to the door.

Hopefully this is a problem that will be addressed sooner rather than later. I wasn't with her, she was driving her van. My aunt was with her but doesn't drive the van. She's often by herself, and this is when the problem is most...problematic.

Whenever I am with her and we run into this problem, I do drop her at the door and park, as I'm familiar with how the van works. Side note: I didn't downvote you, but I assume you thought I did and therefore downvoted my reply. I was just clarifying why she couldn't be dropped at the door. I've seen handicapped vans double park/take up two spaces. It's frustrating, because I myself and handicapped and have tags, so I need a handicapped space, but I just grumble and remind myself that they probably need the space more than I do.
 When there are no handicap spaces, should she just give up on having a vehicle, then? [Read his comment. The van was keyed](http://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/39kyjf/wheelchair_van_defaced_and_angry_note_left_in/cs478il)  So all of the stickers and plates and markings on her car, combined with the filled handicap spots aren't enough explanation already? You think it's justified to vandalize someone's property for parking in a way that allows them to actually live their life? 

If you think a paraplegic is "entitled" for parking this way, you're an asshole. That one "entitlement" doesn't outweigh the many other burdens she faces due to her illness and handicap.  I can't tell if you are serious or trolling.  Either scenario is sad. User now tagged as "wheelchair-bound people are entitled"  are you retarded? That happens to me too. I am not wheelchair bound, but I am definitely handicapped, and the striped off areas are generally a tight fit if someone parks there (they are not meant to be a full parking space), so it's either edge through the narrow gap to my side when there is very little room and a lot of ways for me to fall and/or injure myself, or enter through one of the passenger side doors and climb into that driver's seat. That second option is actually not an option, I have MS, there is no way I can clamber around inside my car. 

So last time this happened, I opened my trunk and stepped in (I have a crossover SUV - so there is a nice big place for me to sit and there is no climbing in or out, it's pretty much butt high for me). Then I used my autostart over and over to keep the car air conditioned, and I listened to some music and dicked around on my phone until the tow truck (that I had the grocery store I had been in call) came and towed the asshole's car away. I'm just glad I hadn't bought anything frozen food at the store. You know what would be really great ? A mobile app you can snap a picture of any car in a handicap spot or firelane, and submit to traffic enforcement for some sort of automatic violation.    I'm in some wealthy burbs, I park my car out and walk even when I was wearing a boot on my leg, and inevitably there's be some self important asshole parked in the firelane to drop off their cleaning, get groceries,  handicap spots too - they don't care.  THey're more important than everyone else.  They do have cameras. We're working on getting the footage. I emailed WBAL with this as a story idea, as I think if they were able to show the footage, we'd find who did it pretty quickly. The police can get the footage, but they won't necessarily find the person if they are the only ones looking. I realize they've got bigger fish to fry. Totally understand you can't judge a book by its cover and I'm not in a position to judge your circumstances without knowing more. My point was that there are too many permits right now for the availability of spots. They need to either be increased or they need to start being more discriminatory towards who gets one.

If you look at the standards for what it takes to get a permit in Maryland I would consider revising 3 things immediately:

* Has lung disease to such an extent that forced (respiratory) expiratory volume for one second, when measured by spirometry, is less than one liter, or arterial oxygen tension (pO2) is less than 60 mm/hg on room air at rest.
* Has cardiovascular disease limitations classified in severity as Class III or Class IV according to the standards set by the American Heart Association.
* Has a permanent impairment of both eyes so that: 1) The central vision acuity is 20/200 or less in the better eye, with corrective glasses, or 2) There is a field defect in which the peripheral field has contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye. See Note (C) “Certification Under Maryland Law”.

I'm not a healthcare expert by any means but 1 & 2 strike me as things that are mostly self induced by people not taking care of themselves (I'm aware things such as heart disease can be genetic). It'd be worth further evaluating adding rules on to these such as "for non-smokers" or "who fall within the guidelines for not being obese". For 3, while the blind are permanently impaired they are perfectly capable of walking long distances and as such do not need a handicap permit in the same way as a paraplegic.

edit: formatting
 People don't get them for being old, though. Aging may cause the medical issue, but they get tags because they are fall hazards or have difficulty with stamina (walking long distances). That's why my grandmother has her tag. She's 88. That's not why she got her tag. She got it because if she walks long distances, she'll lose her balance or she will become weak and faint/fall and you don't survive falls very long at that age.

It's not like when you hit retirement they just hand them out. You have to apply, via doctor's note, listing a legitimate medical condition, same as everybody else. I used to have this exact problem (not to mention people parking in the access lane NEXT to my van - it's striped for a reason, people - the big sticker on the van saying "5 feet of clearance needed" apparently wasn't enough of a clue) I often parked in the furthest corner of the lot and used a couple of cones to block off the next space.  Eventually I got a van with a rear lift, which is useless in the city unless it's in a parking garage. I did not actually. I'm honestly not sure why you or I am being downvoted. Even if people don't agree with my stance of us relevant to the thread. Should someone who can't find a standard space at a busy location or time of year give up driving?  [removed] I'm sorry, what solutions do you have that are so much better they make mine "sad." Or is it sad that I'm offering solutions to her problem rather than throwing a pity party? They are, and the law agrees. Do you think disabled people don't deserve special treatment?

I really don't understand why people think entitle is a bad word. Are you unaware that the government literally calls it's welfare programs and such assistance entitlements? Or do you think that's the government taking a jab at people who need assistance?

She can continue to think she deserves to park in two spots and deal with the repercussions while trying to mitigate issues or she can stop doing it. Those are the solutions within her ability to fix the problem. Do you have another one? Please elaborate because it seems you are the retard here if you think that. Not only because you seem to not know what entitled means but you also seem to not understand that even if you don't and use some urban dictionary definition what I wrote would make me an asshole, it has no bearing on my intelligence.  I fucking hate people who park in fire lanes.  Back home in NJ, no one did this (you'd get your ass beat).  But here in Baltimore, it's the thing to do.  Rude. There is a Baltimore 311 app, at least for android.  >  I emailed WBAL with this as a story idea, as I think if they were able to show the footage...

If you can get footage for them, that will increase their interest in the story, because it raw footage draws viewers (which in turn sells ads) so they will be more interested in the piece with footage than without.

A story on the nightly news about this would be a good opportunity for people to hear "two spots are required for a wheelchair access, etc." as well, since clearly lots of people don't know that.

Good luck.
 That's great.  Hope it works out - what an awful thing for your mom to have to go through.
 Lung disease and breathing problems aren't necessarily from smoking or obesity. Severe asthma as well as chemical exposure and things like Wegener's disease can make mobility hard. Obesity can be caused by genetics or another medical or mental issue as well, it's not always gluttony. And even if it is from over indulgence, it's not really our place to punish people for it.

I think that there should definitely be reform, but it shouldn't be to punish people who have issues, it should be to cut out the ones who take advantage. I know someone with a tag because he's old. He's not even that old, and he complained about aches and pains to his doctor to get the tag, and his ridiculous doctor gave it to him. Because some people don't have morals.

Also, I'm not sure how not having the use of one hand is a qualifier for handicap tags. That one seems a little silly to me, far moreso than qualifications 1 and 2. The problem as I've seen it is people parking in those spots without handicap tags.  If you've got the tags/permits, but don't look disabled, I'm not going to judge.  But if you're walking by yourself and don't have tags, you can fuck right off.  Even if you are handicapped, you need to go through the process to get the tags. I disagree on the first two and am unclear on the third. For 1 and 2 as much as it sucks, we can't exclude a group of disabled individuals because due to the cause of their current condition. There are plenty of ways to become permanently disabled due to both poor self care and poor decision making - whether it is the choice to smoke or the choice to avoid the warning at the beginning of the episode of Jackass you are watching and go ahead and try to replicate one of the stunts. As much as it frustrates me to see parking spaces I need taken up by people who are the source of their own problem (I can't literally see them, but I know they exist), disability parking and disability services in general must be determined by **medical need, and nothing else.** We cannot introduce moral judgment into the equation, as much as we would like to. When moral judgment gets involved, you introduce subjectivity, and subjectivity would be disastrous for a system like this. One could argue that my disability isn't self induced, but it self-worsened - I had a son, now 5, which makes me more tired, which can affect all aspects of my illness. I knew of my illness when I intentionally conceived my son, therefore it could be argued that because I contributed to condition with 'poor self care' (parenting is poor self care, period), and therefore I am undeserving of my parking tag. That's pretty ridiculous, but I guarantee you, someone out there believes it's a valid argument, and that person would invariably end up on the deciding committee or what have you (this is based on my 3 year journey to get disability benefits, it's an outrageous process with lots of moronic governmental opinions). I feel bad for that kid who became a paraplegic imitating Jackass, or the person who started smoking at 15 because their tiny teenage brain thought it was cool, and wasn't able to quit before too much damage was done. We just can't introduce moral subjectivity into the process. Our government doesn't seem to manage that very well.
 
As for number 3, I'm not sure how/if that person should be driving. Should we also exclude people who are disabled due to an injury sustained during exercise? That's self-inflicted as well. sorry for the accusation. Trolls probably. Because people in this sub use the downvote button as a disagree button, not to flag things as irrelevant to the thread.   What's she gonna do, sit out there and explain why she needs two spots? If someone legitimately needs two spots then that's fine. The issue is the people who don't feel like walking so they park where they shouldn't be parking.  Are you on drugs, hon? The persons vehicle was vandalized because they had to leave enough space so she could get out with her wheel chair.  And you call her "entitled."

So don't try to put me on the defensive about this. For more than a decade entitlement [in common parlance](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=entitlement) has meant "one who is undeserving of the things which they expect." 

You just said a wheelchair-bound person should "park properly or...[continue] to be entitled and park like that."    

You literally used "entitled" in its disparaging form right there.   Nowhere have I mentioned the word *entitled* or have I referenced urbandictionary. Do you have a reading disorder? Oddly, NJ drivers seem to respect rules of the road better.  Sounds counterintuitive, but every time I'm on the turnpike I love how people use the blinky side light flasher things, and don't hang out in the left lane.   In Baltimore, we don't like snitches, either. I agree there are other things that could cause those issues which is why I suggested adding on qualifiers (in order to qualify you must not have a medical history of smoking for X amount of years) vs removing those options altogether. We have a difference of opinion I think regarding "punishing" people for self-inflicted disabilities but I don't expect everyone to agree with me about it. IMO I just don't think you deserve to take a spot from someone born with a genetic disability like muscular dystrophy because you have breathing issues due to smoking your whole life. I believe you should have to live with the consequences of your actions. I leave notes on cars like that. Sometimes in red lipstick, on the windshield. [removed] Oh, you just don't know the definition of entitled.  [removed] Care to elaborate on what you were talking about then? The "retarded" part of my post. You're heavy on the insults and completely lacking in substance, kind of how retards talk. So I had to assume what upset you. Sorry. Right?  I'm glad I'm not the only one that sees that, because I thought I was going crazy.  NJ people are always really good about 4-way stops too.  Everyone is respectful.  Here in MD it's a total shit show, every time. What? Route 1 is the worst for people camping out in the left lane. I used to have a commute from Edison to Princeton and it would drive me insane. 

The only noticeable thing I have witnessed that is demonstrably worse in Maryland (Baltimore, specifically) is the utter disregard for red lights. I travel all across North America for work and I've never seen anything like it anywhere else In NJ it is [illegal](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/right_on_left-lane_laggards_could_see_fines_double.html) to use the left lane except to pass or turn left.  Because people want to be able to break the law.  No love for that.  We might as well be animals. I like the cut of your jib. If someone ignores the wheelchair ramp sticker then they're probably gonna ignore the ramp. A note doesn't deter dickheads.... Oh, I guess you're right.  Silly me. Sweet ad hominem bro.  > Solutions are your mom either finds a handicap spot

Except that there were no handicap spots available.

> or she continues to be entitled and park like that and leave a note explaining.

So, wait. It's her fault that someone vandalized her van and she should have left a note? You believe that the proper thing to do when someone parks "wrong" is to key their car? aw geez, rt 1 is terrible everywhere.  But on the turnpike folk seem to be very good about  signalling, passing, signalling moving back over.  The lower states could learn something from that for sure. I've done far, far worse, to a repeat offender outside my doctor's office. Look in my post history, I put it in /r/revengeporn  or something. I guess that just leaves parking correctly as a solution then.  Not a fallacy. But if it were so, sick argumentum ad logicam bro. Let's keep the fallacy Olympics going, since it's clear you don't have an argument left.

To be honest it's not even an ad hominem as i address the content of your post. Wow you're either retarded or you didn't honestly read my post this way.


>Except that there were no handicap spots available.

Ever? Ever ever? I'm giving her solutions to avoid this scenario in the future, not to magically fix an event that has already happened. Idiot.


>So, wait. It's her fault that someone vandalized her van and she should have left a note? You believe that the proper thing to do when someone parks "wrong" is to key their car?

Well, yes. She double parked and got keyed because of it. That is her fault. That's not really a debatable point. But why would that ever be the proper thing to do? I said nothing of the sort. Nothing even close. I don't know how you got that retarded idea that I think she deserved it.


I'm almost certain your issue was the entitled thing and you got fucked up before you could even get into it so you made this autistic display up. > Sorry that you're at an intellectual level where your mind goes to urban dictionary

clearly that's not a character attack at all. > Ever? Ever ever? I'm giving her solutions to avoid this scenario in the future, not to magically fix an event that has already happened. Idiot.

This scenario was that there were no available handicap spots. Are you high?

>Well, yes. She double parked and got keyed because of it. That is her fault.

You're one of those people who say it's someone's fault if they get drunk and are raped.

>I don't know how you got that retarded idea that I think she deserved it.

Hm. I wonder....

> She double parked and got keyed because of it. **That is her fault**.

Yeah, I wonder where you could have ever given anyone that idea...

>I'm almost certain your issue was the entitled thing and you got fucked up before you could even get into it so you made this autistic display up.

No, my issue was with your inability to empathize and your decision to blame the victim. Beyond that, you keep piling it on. Oh you're one of those redditors that have a superficial grasp of fallacies but like to yell them loudly every time you are losing a discussion. 

I'm guessing you checked Wikipedia to learn what ad hominem is and picked the first half of the first sentence while ignoring the second half of the sentence which proves you wrong, as well as everything after it.

Anyway even if you were right I already trumped your fallacy card with my argument ad logicum fallacy card. So like I said before, offer an argument or let's keep the fallacy Olympics going.  
>This scenario was that there were no available handicap spots. Are you high?

Leaving solution 2: put a note explaining. You're honestly dumb as fuck. 


>You're one of those people who say it's someone's fault if they get drunk and are raped.

Nah.


>Yeah, I wonder where you could have ever given anyone that idea...

Fault and deserving it are two mutually exclusive things, dumbass.


>No, my issue was with your inability to empathize and your decision to blame the victim. Beyond that, you keep piling it on.

This goes back to my old point of you're a retarded, that would make me an asshole but has no bearing on my intelligence. But anyway, lol you're pulling the victim blaming card and also getting pissy at me for  offering solutions rather than joining the pity party. You're a joke. Tell me more jokes, monkey.  Nope. I took Logic at UMBC under Roye Templeton 20 years ago.  I got a C-  
  
But it's good to see that you have been using Reddit for 4 months and already created a nice portrait of different types of idiot Redditors there are.  
  
Keep on shining, you bright, beautiful star. > Leaving solution 2: put a note explaining. You're honestly dumb as fuck.

So then why offer solution 1? And do you honestly think that people who are shitty enough to key someone's car for parking "wrong" in someone else's private property are going to care about a note when the van had numerous handicap markings already?

>Fault and deserving it are two mutually exclusive things, dumbass.

Actually, the way you used them they are not. You said that what happened to her van (the actions of others) were her fault. It seems in this case, you're the one in need of a dictionary.

>Deserving:

>worthy of being treated in a particular way

##

>Fault:

>responsibility for an accident or misfortune.

So, you're saying that being responsible for an outcome (having your van keyed) and being worthy of being treated in a [bad] way (having your van keyed) are mutually exclusive. Or, maybe you don't know what mutually exclusive is. 

>In logic and probability theory, two propositions (or events) are mutually exclusive or disjoint if they cannot both be true (occur).

Is there another definition of mutual exclusion that you can show me where it means two things can both be true?

>This goes back to my old point of you're a retarded

I'm a retarded what?

> that would make me an asshole but has no bearing on my intelligence.

I didn't call you retarded. I asked if you were retarded because that would explain how you could honestly hold your views in a way that makes sense to you. It was essentially giving you the benefit of the doubt.

> But anyway, lol you're pulling the victim blaming card and also getting pissy at me for offering solutions

The only "solutions" you've offered are either park in a nonexistent handicap spot, or hang a sign in addition to the handicap markings already present, and believe that the type of people who would key what is obviously a handicap van will see another sign and decide not to key the van.

> rather than joining the pity party.

I didn't think this was a pity party. I took it more as an expression of outrage followed by you essentially defending the actions of criminals. Yeah man, I'm with you. Why doesn't his mom just grow legs! Grow useable legs and walk around like everybody else!

We'd also probably agree that the poor people in Sandtown should just be rich. Get up, go out there, and be rich!

Thankfully smart people like you figured this out a long time ago.

Keep fighting that good fight man, we'll show them for being poor and paraplegic for not being rich or usable legs!

Edit: Seriously, Downvotes? So entitled. Well he didn't teach you appeal to authority apparently. Lmao. That or you fail to see the irony of using a fallacy here. Which is also hilarious. 

Anyway, argumentum ad logicum. You're just crying fallacy because you have no valid response. 
I'll sum up the conversation here for you:
You:Urban dictionary says entitled means x
Me: Well I was using the dictionary defense, not that. And also that's pretty stupid to assume urban dictionary over the actual definition.
You: WAHH AD HOMINEM FALLACY AD HOMINEM  Okay. You're mad as fuck lol. By the way full disclosure I didn't read this post at all, still loling at the account you made. I'm honored. Seriously, thank you for this honor. Trolling is fun, isn't it? Oh, nice recovery.

"Oh, btw, I didn't even read it"

nice save, bro. nice save. You two are hilarious. Lol you obviously were trying to get a rise from me, your "tagged" post makes that clear, but you look silly going "I'm not actually a retard, I was pretending."

 Lol you're just mad I didn't even read it and you're trying to goad me into doing so. I could have just given my response without saying anything and you'd be none the wiser. But I wanted you to know, I knew it'd upset you. You're displaying the behavior of a mentally ill person. I'm bored and you're mad as fuck, so there's really no reason for me to continue this friendly debate were having. It's a beautiful Saturday, why are you on reddit creating accounts to try to harass people? Take care, get better. I actually am retarded. uh-huh. Sure. Now I feel bad finally.
