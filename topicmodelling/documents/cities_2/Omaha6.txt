Anywhere I could rent a wheelchair in Omaha? I am filming a short tomorrow and need one for a dolly. Does anyone know where I could rent one? Kohll's Pharmacy will do rentals of wheelchairs or other medical equipment.

http://kohlls.com/ I used to have two but have since given them away.  I found them at thrift America for 10-20 bucks.  Medicine Man Pharmacy on 132nd and Dodge might still rent them out. I worked there a long time ago. how large is your camera package? could you get by with something smaller like a furniture dolly? I work at Kohll's, so I can confirm this. Come on in, and we'll take amazing care of you.

We have tons of locations around town, so I'm sure you can find a spot that will work for you.
