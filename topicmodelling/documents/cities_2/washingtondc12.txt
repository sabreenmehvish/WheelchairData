Advice on hosting an elderly visitor I'm hosting my Grandma for a week or so. Walking an extensive amount is an issue, so a lot of past staples won't work. I'm afraid gems like Dan's Cafe are out too. Curious what others have had on the agenda in a similar situation. Thanks! You could do the Hop-on, Hop-off tourist buses. They are cheesy, sure, but they do a good job of providing commentary to what you are seeing and get you to the tourist hot-spots without a hassle.  If you want to take her around the monuments, you could take a pedicab. I had family visit who didn't walk much and we planned light days with only one or two museums or tourist attractions. When we did museums, they were rather a quick look at one or two exhibits then stopped for coffee and muffins after. We ubered from door to door. I found that they really enjoyed just observing the national mall areas from an uber actually. 

Kennedy center was a hit because there's the rooftop patio that overlooks everything plus we got to see a good show (again with a "sitting" event in mind). We also saw a presentation from Ford's theater (another spot to sit and do a tourist type thing).  Hillwood Estate You can rent a wheelchair or scooter for however long she's staying.  My mother had a stroke recently, and she found DC quite difficult.  It's not only the walking, but the unevenness of the pavement, the older sidewalks, and old buildings that aren't exactly build to modern codes were all hard for her to keep her balance and get around in.  I don't know that much about your grandmother's mobility issues, but we stuck to places well-traveled and certain to have handicap accessibility when my mother was here - Smithsonian, Newseum, etc.  She loves house museums, but they were too hard for her.  We took a lot of cabs that week, too. Maybe you could get a motorized wheelchair rental. See a show at the Kennedy center or Ford's theater. No walking, but they are still historic/iconic DC places. If you have a car, I'd take her to the arboretum.  We did this with my parents when my mom had a ruptured disc in her back.  It was a short drive out there, she could get out and walk around a little and enjoy the flowers and the bonsai, and we could drive slowly through some of the nice parts without having a lot of walking there and back.

The Phillips Collection isn't free, but it's a nice manageably sized museum with lots of elevators and ramps, and a nice little cafe plus other places to sit if she gets worn out.  Especially if you can uber there, it might be a fun outing.

A lot of the museums also have wheelchair/scooter rental, but you'll have to assess her level of comfort with that.  

And movies are always fun!  There's that fancy movie theater by the 9:30 club whose name escapes me at the moment, but it's got super comfy chairs and good snacks/drinks. Hillwood. Botanic Gardens.

I did this with relatives who can't walk much and they loved it. We actually did one full loop, just sitting on the bus and seeing All The Options. Then, on the 2nd go-round onwards, we actually disembarked at various sites.  Yes, gorgeous, mellow, beautiful gardens to rest in. Agreed with this.  I once hosted a person with limited mobility and discovered that the local mom and pop pharmacy in my neighborhood rents out wheelchairs.  This was very helpful, too bad we didn't have temporary handicap parking stickers, however.
