wheelchair-bound man who sues inaccessible shops can walk  The most shocking line of this article is that the man in those pictures is ***24...*** Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker. "Can Walk" =/= Doesn't need a wheelchair ADA compliance has a ton of secondary benefits, so it's good to get businesses to install accessible accommodations.  Just sucks that it requires lawsuits, because the legal system is just asking to be abused.... Wow I didn't know fat ages you that much. He's 24 looking like he 50. [removed] I get it that he's just trying to enrich himself by bribing companies.   

But why is NYC so anti-ADA?  

There's so many properties that are not wheelchair accessible.  Just look at the subway to see how bad things are for people with mobility issues.  I see a lot of people saying that what he’s doing isn’t that bad because it means more ADA complaint buildings. 

The problem is he’s extorting money from small businesses. It’s one thing to want more complaint buildings I’m all for ADA compliance and assistance for the disabled. It’s another to sue and take money that could actually be put forth for the ramps. I don’t care what you believe, what he’s doing isn’t ethical and I’m sure there are more reasonable avenues to getting ramps in for the disabled that don’t involve suing. The logic doesn’t add up, disabled person sues business because they don’t have ramp, maybe the business doesn’t have the funds to pay to have one installed, after they get sued they have less money.  My brother is disabled so fuck this douche. Barely.

Secondly lawsuits such as this are the only way we can be sure the ADA is enforced.  Anyone who thinks the Feds, the state or the county (city) are following up on people is deluded.
 Dude is dick but based in that photo he is literally reaching to someone to help him stand...he don't look to mobile to me. Looks like he invested all the profits from his scam into doritos and Mountain Dew. I represented a couple stores sued by a serial plaintiff based on accessibility, but it wasn't this guy. The attorney I was against was a total piece of shit though. The real life Cartman  wheelchair-bound <> can walk I rather hire a goon 25k to bust his head open and lay him in a coma instead of paying 50k for every lawsuit The worst part of this, for me, is that a lot of people who use wheelchairs can walk--but have things like pain issues, balance concerns, etc that make it safer and for a better quality of life to use a wheelchair. But if you can walk, even a bit, people assume you're faking it. I have chronic pain issues from lupus and for a brief while it was bad enough that I needed a wheelchair sometimes to be able to do even simple things like get groceries, etc. And strangers *will* come up to you and start yelling if you get up for even half a second to get some bread off a higher shelf. 

This guy, and others like him, are the reason people are "on the lookout" for "fake" disabled people.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2018/07/22/wheelchair-bound-man-demands-50k-from-inaccessible-shops/amp/

This article shows that he visited a bridal store and Dior. I’m pretty sure an overweight slob like this guy has no real business there. I'd like to kindly remind everyone that a lot of people in wheelchairs can, in fact, walk short distances and stand for a short while. Popular depictions in media of disabled people are quite misleading about what it means to be disabled: Being disabled can also mean limited mobility. 

As a result, \*\*there's been a stigma for disabled people to exercise what limited mobility they have in fear of being ridiculed by the public.\*\* 🎵kankle, kankle, kankle I make you out of clay🎵 Really his own lawyer didn't know he wasn't fully handicapped? He should be disbarred.  Businesses *should* be pushed to provide better handicap accessibility.  This city sucks for those not able bodied. But it's insane to me that an individual can personally profit because its hard for them to shop clothes at a single store of a chain brand or because they are too proud to accept assistance.  Its hard enough for shops to stay in business here without being extorted for tens of thousands.   HOLY SHIT! I know that guy!

I grew up in Rego Park and used to see him often. This is hilarious.  It's a miracle!

And on a kinder, gentler note: the ADA has been law now for way over ten years - if businesses haven't complied by now then shame on them (and fine the shit out of them) and shame on the building inspection departments for not red tagging noncompliance. Wasn’t this a South Park episode? Not defending this guy, but a lot of people who need wheelchairs can still walk short distances. [Andy? Is that you?](https://youtu.be/CyV7-_Z5Q7Y?t=16s) whos high pitch? Obesity is an epidemic  Of course.  question everything.  Fake News. On the left? I wouldn’t call that “walking”... This poor man clearly suffers from advanced Lucas’ Chin So, because he's standing, he doesn't have standing to sue?  A catch-22! FAKE HANDICAPPED!! [removed] He walked to a car that brought him to a local Jewish center? Hmmm, I think its only fair that he gets to enjoy the fruits of his labor... permanently [\*hint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndeDgR54kIM) About as honorable as any other job in the city. "Drinking has ruined my life. I'm 31 years old!" In dog years  Ugly has no age. It's just ugly. being a fat slob who never takes care of themselves will do that to a person.  Hopefully his heart gives out soon and the issue takes care of itself.  Dude is a fucking parasite This guy fuckin walks.  I've never been more sure of anything in my life. You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an *asshole*. STAY AWAY FROM ME MISTER! Apparently you are the only one who gives a shit about the rules. Right? Something like 90% of wheelchair users have limited mobility and don’t need to use it 100% of the time, but the attitude of “YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR WHEELCHAIR BRIEFLY YOU FAKER” keeps them from doing so.  He's a faker who is just too fat to walk from place to place.  The cane designed for the blind, the multiple law suits, the amazing lack of a need for a wheelchair, screw this dude.  but don't you think that should be done through an administrative process with potential fines levied by the proper agency and not a personal lawsuit where you profit from it? First of all, I bet most of those businesses are grandfathered in before those laws were enacted. When they do construction they will have to bring things up to code.  Yeah if this guy can profit by making the world better then why not the Kings of Scams i'm sure his dreams of becoming a barber or a jeweler were crushed by his disability. I'm VERY surprised someone on reddit knows about Bukharian jews and their...shady practices at times. ADA was only signed into law back in the 1990s and most of the city is much older than that.  

Any new public building has to be made accessible, but it will take a long time before the city's old construction can be renovated to become up to ADA standards.  Much of the construction is also designed in such a way that ADA retrofits are all but impossible without a complete demolition. Yeah I had a friend who broke her ankle a few years ago. She lived in Bushwick and was basically just rendered homebound because she couldn't use stairs.

She was already fairly low-income too and couldn't work while her ankle was broken. It essentially ruined her financially and was the final catalyst in her moving out of the city. :-( I broke both my feet a few years back and was confined to a wheelchair for about three months. I was barely able to even leave my apartment without my wife due to the inaccessibility.

Even a city government building! I was there for a work meeting and was literally trapped in the floor lobby/elevator area because the doors to the office space--big heavy glass ones--did not open automatically.  It usually hits me when I bring out the stroller just how inaccessible the subway system is.  Very few stations have elevators. You'd have to go extremely out of your way to get from A to B using elevator accessible stations.  Reminds me of this hilarious, but also depressing, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhpUJRGrZgc) of Zach Anner trying to navigate the subways to get a rainbow bagel.

I think it's just hard for small businesses (which is what this guy was targeting) to sacrifice the money/time/space to make everything accessible. Apparently, we're still one of the most accessible cities in the US?
Like, if you're a small business and you get a building that is not accessible, it's unfortunately probably not gonna be on the top of your priorities to make it so during your first year of business. :/ To the people who downvoted me so quickly:

Please tell me why you think that NYC business should be exempt from federal laws that require buildings to be handicapped accessible?  It's mostly the city itself that is anti-ADA.

Since a lot of city and it's infrastructure was built before 1990 it wasn't necessarily built with access in mind. The ADA requires buildings to conform with ADA when the building is renovated. And for the most part the ADA is complied with. Almost every set of plans I come across has a page or two dedicated to ADA compliance. 

The problem is of course public buildings and the subways are incredibly inaccessible.  I had to transport a wheelchair from Greenwich Village to the Heights a few years back, and holy hell I wouldn't wish that torture on my worst enemy.  The Fordham-pelham juncture is inexplicably wheelchair inaccessible. The closest accessible sidewalk is miles away. I dont care if this guy is a liar. Fix the roads ADA is great except it didn't include enough Federal spending to demolish and rebuild everything on the island of Manhattan ADA was enacted in 1990.  The city's subway system was built decades before that.  Thinking the subway system should comply with laws enacted so long after they were built is silly. Because it costs $27,000,000 to put in a single elevator on a subway station.  He’s hitting places in historic buildings that just can’t be fully Ada. Same applies with the subway. Most entrances were built before. All new ones are built fully compliant but to modify existing ones is extremely expensive and virtually impossible considering a lot of the entrances.  Because most everything here was built a long time ago.  NYC is anti poor too I mean he got companies to become ADA compliant so I think it's actually I win My sister is disabled and I'm happy that this man is forcing business to comply with ADA It's probable that he has low mobility, but the article makes it sound like he's extorting businesses without real promise of action. There's some presented evidence supporting that claim, but it feels like we aren't getting both sides of the story.

You're right though, ADA enforcement has often been left to those who rely on it for equal access. The City's always been terrible, ADA-wise. The issue is, it seems like there were no lawsuits. It was "give me money or there WILL be a lawsuit". If he was going around forcing companies to actually take action to address ADA issues, fuck it, he's good whether or not he can walk personally.

As it is, if he lets the company slide while pocketing the cash, that literally helps nobody but himself... which is kind of fucked up regardless of his mobility situation (but especially so if he can, in fact, walk). Here he is walking on his own. Just google his name, there's a lot of pics of him standing/walking. I'm not sure why none of the business he sued would just bring those pictures to court.

https://nypost.com/2018/07/26/walking-wheelchair-riding-man-wont-talk-about-alleged-handicap-scams/ The whole 'degree of disability' is some horse shit (although this serial litigation for your own enrichment is too), but the attorney better know the details of the situation to launch multiple lawsuits! And what kind of shitty law school teaches you to immediately throw your client under the bus in an interview when handed tenuous 'evidence' against him?  Was he disabled growing up? Almost 30 years at this point.  It was 1990. Why fine the businesses though? It seems like this would be on the landlords
 Thats not how the ADA/Building Codes work.  I think he has legitimate mental problems dude. Screwing smalls businesses is as honorable as any other job in the city?  I see you've played knifey-spooney before! It's clearly a scam, but aside from this story, just because someone is in a wheelchair doesn't necessarily mean they can't walk. Wheelchairs can also assist people who have difficulty walking. They may be able to walk for very short distances or at a very slow pace, but cannot walk well enough to be mobile without a wheelchair. Walking to your front door doesn't necessarily mean you're not disabled. He looks like he could use a little more of walking. Psh a wheelchair? I can get you a wheelchair. There are ways dude you don't even wanna know. Hell I can get you a wheelchair this afternoon. Fuckin amateurs! Stay away from me mister! Even if people haven’t seen Lebowski, they can’t fuckin recognize when an exchange is an inside joke they’re on the outside of? Jeez This guy doesn't fuck though. It's says in the article he walks He could also have vision issues, like nothing youre saying means he cant also legitimately need a wheelchair He might have diabetes. It can cause diabetic neuropathy which can affect eye sight and make it difficult to walk.  >He's a faker who is just too fat to walk from place to place

So first you say he is faking something, then you say he has difficulty walking?

>The cane designed for the blind

It's also intended for people who have difficulty seeing, how do you know know he doesn't need it?

>the multiple law suits

Isn't the point of a lawsuit to prove if something happened? He's suing places that are not accommodating people with disabilities, don't you you think it would be good if all places followed ADA law?

> the amazing lack of a need for a wheelchair, screw this dude. 

As you mentioned earlier, he has difficulty walking, which would explain why he needs a wheelchair. Why should he be "screwed" instead of shown basic human empathy?

 The federal ADA only has private lawsuits as an enforcement mechanism and the only way to find out whether you're compliant is to get sued. It's not like you can pay a professional to come out and certify that you're compliant.  If the proper channels were expedient, then yes. But the proper channels can take years and years and have all sorts of grandfathered loopholes.

This guy sounds like an ass, but it is in a business' best interest to get ADA compliant so they don't have to deal with 100's others like him. I'm not gonna claim that governmental agencies always operate in the most efficient ways. :)

I am also under the impression that the text of the ADA has some pretty broad language that would allow businesses to make a case that coming into compliance would be overly burdensome.  But that'd probably require lawyers.   Depends how much construction they do.  For instance the MTA has become rather expert at doing just enough refurbishment to avoid having to install elevators. :) What about owning one of those $3M stucco houses in Forest Hills? Isn’t that their primary aspiration? That's because most people are probably more acquainted with either the Hasids in the diamond district or the batshit crazy Satmar up in places like Kiryas Joel. 

(Source: Am a Jew. Reform. Sephardi/Maghrebi.) Born and raised in queens. Bukharian jews and their “practices” are an inescapable part of life here  fun fact ; Bukhari is also a surname found amongst the people of Afghanistan and Northern India( Kashmir )/ Pakistan.    There's a dish called Dal Aloo Bukhara . ADA is also not retroactive.  New construction and alterations are required to comply with ADA but anything that is existing does not. How the hell did you break both of your feet? always amazes me how many people will walk by a tiny mother trying to carry a stroller down the stairs

it takes you an extra minute, you get a little exercise and it helps her out immensely  Most small business owners do not own the building.  If the building is inaccessible, that is the building owner's responsibility. Because ADA was enacted in 1990. Most buildings in NYC were built before that.  ADA is not retroactive.  A lot of these lawsuits have little to no merit in that context. 

Then there is the other issue that tenants are being targeted when it is the building owner who should be responsible for fixing these issues. It should have been built with access in mind even if they weren't legally required to at the time. It's not like there weren't disabled people back then; if anything there were probably more what with Polio and all. The ADA is very specific about what sorts of accessibilty improvements are required when a place of public accommodation is renovated based on the scope of the renovation, burden the improvements would put on the operator, etc.

Just because a place of public accomodation was built before 1990 does not mean it is completely exempt from accessibility improvements, nor should it.

The lack of accessibilty in our transit system is an embarrassment considering how basic a lot of the issues are (like the inability to even keep existing elevators on working order) and the amount of money the agency has devoted to cosmetic and pet projects (like ESI) that provide far less benefit to the public than an accessible system.

All subway stations have undergone some degree of improvement since 1990, and most have undergone a moderately extensive renovation. The ADA requires that 20% of the total cost of a renovation be spent on accessibility improvements, which the MTA has consistently failed to do (and this is a large part of why they are being sued). He really didn't though. It was just to get the cash out of them so he would go away. He didn't even try to get them to come up to ADA compliance. It was literally extortion. Which to a lot of people will do more harm to their views of ADA compliance, either giving them ideas for their own scam or outright thinking the ADA is a scam within itself. He didn't sue them to put in a ramp. He sued them to give him cash. Yeah definitely a win for all the employees they fired / couldn't hire because they're paying off jackoffs like this.  The fact that in many cases he JUST WANTED a kickback makes me so angry.
I'm in Toronto and we have so many NEW businesses that blatantly ignore the need for people in wheelchairs and elderly to be able to safely enter it's hugely frustrating that the government doesn't follow through.   Many wheelchair bound people can walk, or lift themselves out of their chair, and have limited mobility without it. Disability is not a binary, it's a spectrum. Something people have a hard time wrapping their head around.

More importantly, accessibility is for everyone. Sure, you're able-bodied today, but tomorrow you might break your leg and spend a few months hobbling around on crutches. I agree, this does seem possible. This link should be closer to the top. The guy is standing on his own and has a backpack on. That's not someone who "needs" a wheelchair. He has no answer to any questions other than to avoid them. I'm a lawyer and I know a fraudulent serial litigant when I see one. Hint: here's one.  One who will get buried by student loans when they loose their right to practice.   He was always a fat kid and over time I thought he actually went blind. No idea if he's really blind though. I never spoke to him, just saw him around the neighborhood. He has a sister who I think is mentally challenged as well, he might be slightly too.  holy shit... has it really been that long?

Thanks for the information - my bad. I mean, I knew it was a while ago, but damn!

Yeah, there is NO reason for non-compliance, even considering the lengthy 'grace period' they gave, at this late hour.

thanks again. Agreed. However, it would start at the business level because the inspection departments are not going to waste their time looking up ownership, especially considering sometimes ownership can be two and three "corporations" deep. Additionally, the inspection departments aren't going to delve into what may or may not be contracted in the rental agreement... so you go for the obvious and let "them" duke it out.

You fine the people you can see, with the clause they have 30-60 days to comply *or have the property owner comply*, and if nothing is done - the fine, and possible business closure, happens.

Problem is ADA enforcers not using the "teeth" that came with the law as well as they should be. Is it hard to comply... expensive? Usually, so that's why the fine is more than the cost to comply. Please... regale me with how the ADA law works. I'm trolling for downvotes. Thanks for saying that. I came to say this.  (OP quoted a line from The Big Lebowski)  Except in this case, according to several of the news reports, there are a couple of shopowners he victimized, that offered to help him up a step or two, and he told them he couldn’t walk even that short distance. 

Basically, the guy is a lying sack of shit.  If you can't walk because you're fat.. you dont deserve sympathy. You got that way yourself. There are photos in other articles where it looks like he's walking okay unassisted.  Even if it's slow. For 50k though, would you? Are his vision issues mentioned in his various lawsuits?  Unfortunatley you need a log-in for the PACER system to read pleadings, but I'm gonna doubt it.   Basic human empathy ends when he is blackmailing businesses with multi-million dollar ADA lawsuits that claim disability, then hopping into his friends car for a quick ride to his local hangout.  Empathy also doesn't require require that we ignore obvious fraud.   That's my take on it, too. This guy is a scumbag scam artist who happens to be pushing for positive change, lol. > If the proper channels were expedient, then yes. But the proper channels can take years and years and have all sorts of grandfathered loopholes.
  
They aren't "loopholes". Its how building codes work.   
  
You can't expect building owners to to re-comply with each new version of the building code that comes out. ADA is no exception. Its an undue burden. It would be endless construction on every building in the city. 
 At least One had the necessary ramp but he sued because his fat ass required a much wider ramp.  Its fairly simple. When you build new, or undergo heavy renovation (change or occupancy, use, or spending $X dollars vs. the value of the property), you have to comply.   
  
And it makes sense. codes change all the time, and every building in the city would be under endless construction. The only people who would benefit from that would be contractors.  right, all dependent on the type of construction, permits, etc on a .15 acre lot.  > batshit crazy Satmar up in places like Kiryas Joel.

I live in Monroe, it's the only group of people that I can think of that I have never encountered a single redeeming member of. I must say, I loathe them, they only give a shit about themselves. The satmar are all over Williamsburg as well haha yeah, I'm not a huge fan of many of them either. I'm Jewish and Russian myself but their religious practices are aggravating to me, especially with how much they're changing Rego Park and Forest Hills to accommodate the more religious part of them. 

I also find it highly ironic that many of them are so religious and yet so quick to have sex until they get married at a young age. Mainly the guys I know. A lot are nice dudes, but their practices are too polarizing for the most part because so many are stuck in the "old country" mindset.  People say they've had bad experiences with getting the city to agree to any permits without also agreeing to do ADA retrofit

Then again, people love to blame laws/politics for why they never get anywhere with their big plans Rugby, I'm afraid I am not as pliable as I was in my college years. 

But thinking about it again reminded me of other examples. I had a friend from grad school visiting from overseas. He wanted to go out, so we went to a bar (he was kind enough to push my wheelchair). We get to the bar, and are having a good time. A few drinks in, I have to go to the bathroom.

The hallway to the bathroom was maybe 3 inches bigger than the width of my chair. And then, the hallway cut into an L shape with the bathrooms on the other side of the turn. If the chair barely fits in the hallway, it sure as hell cant make the turn. Had to basically jump on my buddies back while he collapsed the chair and reset it up by the bathroom. 

And of course, bathroom was tiny as hell. Chair would not fit. Basically had to push myself up with my hands and use the radiator to get close to the toilet.

I get that it's NYC, but the whole thing really made me sympathize with people who have this problem every day.  I always try to help, and actually always see someone helping. 

The times I see them already doing it alone and ask if they want help, I’m always told no. 

If anything I always feel that NYC is pretty good at these things, getting up for elders and pregnant women too.  What happens if you slip and the kid gets hurt and she sues you? Yep.  I'm a big viking dad and I still have trouble.  NYC stairs are a bitch.  I always see someone helping when this happens, I've actually rarely if ever seen a mother carry a stroller up the stairs. I've helped a few times but I'm pretty sure somone else would have if I didn't.  not my baby, not my problem.  Which is why I included "time" - most businesses, especially small ones, can't afford to lose the days during renovations, so they probably don't actively pursue renovations accommodating disabled people.

Of course, pressure could then be put on the landlord to do it, but I admit I'm not totally clear on how that pressure is best implemented or if the business owners are even able to pass on the responsibility to the building owner? Could these small businesses have just told this guy to talk to their landlord? > The ADA requires that 20% of the total cost of a renovation be spent on accessibility improvements,

Do you have a source for that? Because I've never heard it before.  Are you referring to [this](https://www.ada.gov/reachingout/lesson33.htm)? Because that says something quite different than what you're saying. Hey, NoGoodNamesAvailable, just a quick heads-up:  
**accomodation** is actually spelled **accommodation**. You can remember it by **two cs, two ms**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Any legal attention to the business especially involving ADA will most likely alert the right people to make sure they get fixed but maybe I'm just naive Except this guy isn't suing to get access, he's suing to get money, as evidenced by his willingness to drop his actions for quick lump sum. [Hey, it happens.](https://imgur.com/a/vCrKwCB) Well, if you're like me you have to remind yourself that 1990 ISN'T 15 years ago.... here is the short version: Compliance requirements are not retroactive.  Why? Ah, never seen it. I've heard it's good. Yeah, not saying this guy isn't a con artist. I just wanted to bring that up because a lot of people seem to think that if someone is in a wheelchair, they can't walk at all, so if they stand up for even a second people think they are faking it.

It's a personal issue for me, too. My dad has a nerve disorder that causes him severe pain if he walks long distances. He sometimes uses a wheelchair to make it easier to get around. When I was a kid, I remember some other kids thinking he was paralyzed from the waist down which is obviously not true. Adults have berated him for using a handicap parking placard but getting out of his car and walking. Fortunately, in recent years he has been more active and his condition has been improving, so he has been able to walk farther and doesn't use a wheelchair anymore. I *see* his plan. No clue, and the guy is probably super scumbag but id rather give him the benefit of the doubt than trash a legitimately disabled person. 

He could also just be both but caution is never a bad thing lol Is it really so obvious? As the OP said, there are a lot of limited mobility people who use wheelchairs who don't use them 100% of the time. My grandma can walk, too, but she doesn't do it very much because it's really fucking hard for her. Who are you--or the damn NY Post, a piece of shit publication--to decide his accessibility needs? It's between him and his doctor. My friend's dad growing up was bowlegged and on crutches sometimes, but used a cane at other times, and walked without support at other times.

Even in the fucking picture of him standing, he is clinging to his friend for support. It's meaningless except to get ableist shit-holes riled up and help businesses protect their cashflow. Is it an undue burden to make your building accessible to everyone or is it an undue burden to pay assholes like this guy off?  I work in an architectural firm and routinely file jobs at the Department of Buildings (the "DOB").  I'm also pretty knowledgable about most of the various accessibility laws.  The DOB is required to make sure that any plans you file comply with accessibility requirements.  This is a pain in the ass a lot of times because it's really not feasible on some older buildings and with the way they were built.  It's also usually just an additional cost to who ever is doing the work on a space that they don't own instead of the building owner being responsible for it.  

Anyone who says they have a bad experience with getting a permit without agreeing to ADA is just whining.  It's not an option, it is the law.  The city doesn't say "Make it accessible and we'll give you the permit."  They say it's not code compliant, make it code compliant and then you get your permit.  There's no negotiation.  Yeah, people have to agree to that, I guess.  

There's a waiver process but it's generally assumed you'll get denied unless you meet a lot of requirements.   Not for a lot of the disabled though. I need a cane to walk with my screwed-up knee, and I usually need to either wait longer for a C at Penn Station or stand on the A until, on average, Chambers. Hurts like hell by the time I get to work. Ditto that. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone struggle for more than about 10 seconds with a stroller before I or someone else jumps in.  that's a fair point. my only response is that I ensure that my footing is solid before I continue up the steps

i never really thought of that but I'm still going to do it. it's difficult for me to see something that I can easily help out with and walk by.  have her carry the kid, you carry the stroller I was simplifying a bit, but I don't think what I said was misleading.

Significant alterations to a primary function area of a place of public accomodation (e.g. platform of a subway station) require accessibility along the path of travel to the primary function area to be improved; and if fully improving the path of travel to ADA standards would exceed 20% of the total alteration costs, improvements to the path of travel must be made in a certain order of priority for a cost up to 20% of the total alteration cost.

E.g. if improving the entire travel path to a renovated station platform would cost more than 20% of the station's total renovation budget, the operator would still have to install improvements to the station entrance like a ramp, and if that still fell under 20% of the total the operator would have to continue making improvements to the fare barrier area, concourse, etc. until no more improvements along the path of travel can be made while remaining under the 20% limit.

The MTA has on several occasions failed to make any improvements at all to the path of travel, like at Smith-Ninth Sts where they didn't even install a ramp at the entrance during a multi-million dollar station renovation. Virtually blackmail. Pay us 50k or we will sue you. Even places that had the special ramps got threatened.  If the building/business is older than the ADA regulation, they do not have to do anything. > as evidenced by his willingness to drop his actions for quick lump sum.

It could be he's faking,

Or he doesn't have the money or energy to keep up a long lawsuit, but has trouble working due to mobility issues and has bills to pay. He might be a dick suing for money, but he might also still be disabled enough to need accessibility. These don't have to be mutually exclusive. Oh wow, if a real estate developer is in it for the money he's a hero.  If an ugly scrub is in it for the money he's a turd.

Tell you one thing, I would not want to be in his shoes/chair.  I am disabled, but I can still hold down a job and go sailing.  That guy doesn't look so happy.
 Doesn't matter why he's sueing the business will still need to be ADA compliant ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

Big mean man said you're full of shit?

Damn big mean man.

Be sure to downvote and show me the **POWER !!**! I beg to differ, having had to retrofit dozens of facilities or be in violation of the law (and its subsequent penalties - closure being the main one).  R/nyc is an easily confused place when dealing with irony. It's pretty great, but that's just, like, my opinion, man.  You should! It's one of my favorite movies.  No, I totally get that.  It just seems like he gives truly disabled people a bad name. Both. If they are paying this guy off, thats their issue to decide what to do with it, because in court, they would win.  Yes.  What's even crazier now is that if you get sued, the NY AG ruled last year that not only is the AOR liable but so is the design architect, so erebodys gotta play by the rules now. no way of saying "who me? no, the other guy approved it!" I didn't mean to trigger you but this full-throated defense suggests to me that indeed a lot of ignorant local jerks scapegoat the ADA in this fashion? That’s sucks. If I was in your situation I’d politely ask for a seat when you’re in the train (just shouting it out) but it definitely sucks to have to do, sorry  According to what I cited (where's yours BTW?), it does not say that 20% of the total cost of renovation must be spent on accessibility improvements.  It says that if accessibility improvements were to cost more than 20%, then those costs are considered burdensome above 20%.  What you said is that ALL renovations must have 20% spent on ADA improvements, which I do not believe is true. Hey, NoGoodNamesAvailable, just a quick heads-up:  
**accomodation** is actually spelled **accommodation**. You can remember it by **two cs, two ms**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. One other article about the guy said that he tried to extort a bridal salon and Dior. It’s obvious that he has no true business there - he only wants money. >but he might also still be disabled enough to need accessibility

To buy clothes for pre-teen girls at places like Journey?  This guy is a faker who is abusing the law to get rich.  

The ADA is great, but no single claimant should be allowed to file multiple suits under it within a specific time frame.   Oh sweet summer child. I have a beautiful bridge to sell, and for you and only you I am willing to sell it to you at a huge discount. Look, 1990 basically WAS yesterday for me, so I get where you're coming from. Only if it's being renovated (in general). At this point you can't force a building or tenant to just upgrade their facilities Forget it Deggyy, you're out of your element! I'm not sure what you mean.  I have it from both sides.  From clients who complain about having to comply, but also from clients who seem to do everything in their power to comply but then get burnt anyway.  We have a business owner who was sued for ADA violations and the plaintiff literally just threw everything in the book into his complaint hoping anything will stick, even though at a glance, most of it was bulllshit and didn't apply.  One of the things is that he said the sidewalk outside the space didn't comply with ADA, which is like "What?!?"  How is that his problem?  Sidewalks are controlled by the Dept. of Transportation and the responsibility of the building owner.  Not the retail tenant.  Another one from the complaint was that there were condiments on the accessible counter, impinging his ability to use it.  

I'm all for accessibility requirements.  I just don't like that they're enforced via lawsuit.  I also don't like when they parts are applied to older buildings where it creates a real economic and physical burden on the owner to correct them.  Make no mistake, there are people in this city whose livelihoods are to just go around and sue people over ADA violations.  Whether they are legitimate complaints or not.  There are definitely a few who are well known in the architecture and law industries.  The reason this works is because defending most lawsuits is more expensive than paying them off or doing remedial construction and repairs. When a primary function area is altered, the path of travel to the altered area and the amenities serving the altered area must be made accessible, unless the costs for these changes are disproportionate. The costs for the added alterations are considered disproportionate if they exceed 20 percent of the cost of the overall alteration.

*In this case,* ***you should make as many of the changes as you can without going over the 20 percent limit.*** *Use this order of priority: entrance; route to the primary function area; at least one unisex restroom or one restroom for each sex serving the area; public telephones serving the area; drinking fountains serving the area; other elements.* Its okay one day youll learn life isnt like a movie where everyone in a wheelchair has 0 use of their legs for drama. 

 And I get where you're coming from, agewise!

sigh. You obviously can't read.  Or are just obfuscating to further your agenda, whatever that may be.  Where does it say that you are REQUIRED to spend 20% on ADA improvements per your original statement?  Let me give you an example of how silly your statement was.  Here's an example that you might understand, I will use small numbers for you.  

A restaurant remodels for 1 million dollars.  The restaurant was already ADA accessible and is proposed to be as well.  According to your statement, in this example, the owner is still obligated to spend 20% of his budget, or 200k on ADA improvements, even though there are none required.  How does that work according to you?  

You still don't seem to understand the nuance between your statement and what I sent you.
 I am not saying he isn't disabled, I am saying he is scamming. You cited a guidance document, which is only meant to provide an outline of requirements for business owners. Let's look at the relevant statute, [Title III of the ADA](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm#a402):

§36.403

(a) (1)

>An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary function **shall** be made so as to ensure that, **to the maximum extent feasible**, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration.

...

(f) (1)

>Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.

...

(g) (1)

>When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, **the path of travel *shall* be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.**

(g) (2)

>In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order:
(i) An accessible entrance;
(ii) An accessible route to the altered area;
(iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom;
(iv) Accessible telephones;
(v) Accessible drinking fountains; and
(vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms.


Your example is plainly ridiculous. My original statement was obviously referring to renovations of subway stations that are not already fully accessible. I didn't think it was necessary to cite several paragraphs of administrative law to ensure that pedants on the internet couldn't apply a completely unrelated scenario to my explanation to Prove Me Wrong Online. What you cited again, says the same thing you said earlier, and what my ADA guidance suggested.  I am not some pedant on the internet. I work in Architecture in NYC, have been to numerous seminars on this subject,  and open the ADA book at least weekly and the NYC Building Code book daily.  When you make a general statement that the ADA requires 20% of budget to be spent on improvements, that is actually news to me because I have never heard of it and it would affect my job.  

And once again, you made a general statement that something is law, that affects me and my work, and which I should know about but have never heard of.  You think I'm being pedantic for asking you for a source? I was generally curious.  

My example is also not plainly ridiculous, as that is what would be required by law according to your original statement. Which I asked you to clarify and cite.  When I gave you the guidance document, I specifically said it does not agree with what you stated, but you decided to double down and run with it.  I read this shit daily, trust me. The way that is worded and would be interpreted by architects, lawyers, and enforcement agencies is not what you originally said.  

Go back to being an armchair activist and stop spouting shit as fact when you can't find any evidence for.  Pedant indeed.   > I was simplifying a bit, but I don't think what I said was misleading.

Still stands. I said something that was not fully correct but effectively true for the situation that we were talking about. We clearly both know the actual requirements for alterations under the ADA. You decided to make a big deal about it.
