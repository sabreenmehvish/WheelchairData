Help needed at alamo city comic con Hello, everyone! My husband and I came to our very first ACCC, but he hurt his foot really badly. He's had some stress fractures in the past, and I think the walking made it worse. He can barely walk.

We tried asking for wheelchair rentals at both the first aid booth and guest services, but they don't offer that. Does anyone know where or how we could get either a wheelchair or some crutches? It'd be a great help. 

Thanks! :)  Walgreens or cvs [Tom's Wheelchairs](http://www.tomswheelchairs.com/)

I have passed this place but couldn't tell you anything about it except that they exist.  But they do rent wheelchairs and the are only a few blocks from the Convention Center Check if your hotel will offer a wheelchair for the weekend because of what's going on.  there's a goodwill downtown and if they don't have one, try the salvation army on s alamo. keep us update here if you find one. Thanks, guys :) Goodwill too, honestly. ProjectMEND also sells refurbished & reused medical equipment, such as wheelchairs and crutches. So, what was your result? Personally, I wouldn't.  I have seen a fair share of those break on people shortly after buying them.  They aren't really made for the rigors of downtown.  I'm not being snarky.  Just what I have observed. This is the place the convention I attended there recommended for wheelchair rental. We couldn't find any wheelchairs or crutches, so we just resorted to minimum walking and plenty of stops. We got what we needed and went home early.
