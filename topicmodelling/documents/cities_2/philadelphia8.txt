Airport - Terminal F to B in 50 minutes Assuming my flight is on time, I have a 50 minute layover at PHL and need to get from terminal F to B, what is the best way to do this?  Due to a physical issue I am not the fastest walker, moderate pace is fine, but running is out of the question. The airport map says 18 minutes if I take the shuttle to A. Does this sound like the best way and is this time estimate accurate?

Thanks! The shuttle is your best bet. 

The shuttle is in the center of Terminal F, in the food court. It will take you to terminal A East. There are two moving walkways from A east to B. 


Source: I worked in the airport for 5 years.  Can you arrange with the airport to have accommodations for a wheelchair when your flight lands? 

We get a wheelchair for my mom and it's so helpful! Terminal F is separate from the other terminals. I believe you don't really have a choice besides using the bus shuttle to get there, which I imagine would be the quickest route.  F is international and sits by itself. Unsure of the connection pre-post TSA.. Have you tried to call the airport directly? Maybe they can provide specific transport for your needs. http://www.phl.org/Pages/Passengerinfo/Accessibility/AccessInfo.aspx >,

Thanks! F used to separate, but is now connected. It's a long walk though, so a shuttle bus is available. This guy right here. I believe all terminals (exception maybe A?) have a shuttle bus stop which will take you there relatively quickly. It travels on the aircraft terminal side so no other vehicle traffic. A West is international. F is AA regional flights You may be able to be one of what Seinfeld called "the cart people".  I stand corrected! Contact info is still relevent though.  Can confirm, definitely a regional flight He man, broke a toe in Vegas. Loved my cart ride through O'Hare.
