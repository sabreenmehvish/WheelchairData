Pipe-wielding thief snags man's wheelchair  I had a patient mugged recently and they stole the pad from her wheelchair. She is paraplegic. Now she has pressure ulcers.  I've seen your cousin - SFStabbingGuy. Seems cool. > I had a patient mugged recently and they stole the pad from her wheelchair.

A $100 model or a $400 model? /u/Speiderman I only ask because if it was $100 , I would help you financially to replace it. She had a new pad now, is also clean for a few months!
