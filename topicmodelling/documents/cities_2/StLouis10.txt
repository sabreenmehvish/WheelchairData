A legal attempt to give some protection to pedestrians, cyclists or wheelchair users dealing with St. Louis drivers  [deleted] I've been cussed and and yelled  at riding my bike around south city, especially around Jefferson and gravois. That intersection is the worst! Most drivers don't understand the rules when it comes to bikes. It's scary. DO IT! **DO IT NAUGH!**

I nearly got beamed by a pickup truck with "Jesus Saves" on the bug deflector last Wendesday near Brentwood and Manchester.  You would think a STATE HIGHWAY would have well-maintained sidewalks or some decent pavement while riding a bike downhill?

Apparently, no body wants to touch the Federal government money and reroute it into some lame construction project. ("It's touch Obama hands! Icky!") While I appreciate the motives and energy behind this bill, I completely disagree that writing additional legislation is the answer... It seems clear that the solution is to better design the roads and venues in Saint Louis for the variety of vehicles that travel. However, at the end of *current* day, that majority of vehicles that use our roads are still cars. So, until the benefit of redesigning the roads outweighs the cost, it's going to be tricky to change anything... It's sad that this is an issue. As someone who bikes around town myself I can say it sucks being honked and yelled at, usually for *following* the rules. I miss Portland :P What a dumb law. Throwing things at people is already enough to get you picked up by the cops. I yell at drivers all day long for doing dumb shit. I wont change just because the person is on a bike.  >“The vast majority of miles I’ve ridden in St. Louis have been happy and carefree,

 and why do we need a law again? Missouri's Bicycle and Pedestrian Laws

*For Bicyclists:
On public streets and highways, you have the same rights and responsibilities as a motor vehicle operator. Always ride with traffic, never against it. When operating at less than the posted speed or traffic flow, generally ride as near to the right side of the roadway as safe. The right edge of the road often has hazards like ditches, gutters, sand, gravel shoulders, and so on. Leave space between yourself and these hazards as needed for safety. *

*You may move more toward the middle or left of the lane or roadway, as appropriate: 
when making a left turn, 
when avoiding hazards, 
when the lane is too narrow to share with another vehicle, and 
when there is a right-turn-only lane and you are going straight. 
Always check traffic and signal before changing lanes or changing your position within a lane. On a one-way street, bicyclists may also choose to ride as far left as is safe.*


I always stay to as far left as possible and make damn sure that I am visible as hell. when riding in this city especially when it is dark out throw vanity out the window, toss on that safety vest and turn those lights on. preferably keep your rear light from flashing as the human eye judges distance better with a solid light vs flashing. pretty much all flashing does is get attention.

try and stay the hell off of St.louis sidewalks. I only get on them when I have to turn on my street which is a one way and I do not want to go against traffic and its not traffic legal to do it anyway.

TL;DR

stay left, obey traffic laws, do not ride on the sidewalk, stay VISIBLE They were doing it right. Riding in the road means that you don't die due to doors and road debris. I went through 3 tubes in a week before I learned that a foot more to the left means I don't get flats anymore. EVER. Oh god I miss Portland dearly! Just moved here a few months ago -- so far I'm happy but not a day goes by when I don't think about some awesome aspect of PDX (bike lanes and no-sales-tax and weather and beer and public transportation and good grocery stores and people who have lived in other places and... on and on) fun story. Some jackass tried to pass me while I was in the lane and pinned my foot to my bike. If he put his foot down he could of killed/injured me.

He then proceeded to call me a bitch and say I was a pussy for riding a bike. Yes you in a refrigerated safety cage, weighing so much you haven't seen your penis are so much more macho because you drive a shitbox that costs less than my bike.

This is all while I am in my lane obeying the law.

Heres the best thing. He sped out of there and tried to door me....

fucktard. because drivers can be assholes and little retribution is applicable for hitting a cyclist. I got 2 flats in one week a while back. Finally splurged on the tires that have Kevlar in them... It was worth every penny as I haven't gotten a flat since (over a year ago now... knock on wood) Yes! What part of town are you living in now? hitting, ya cursing... no, what about other drivers or the DB that is texting and steps out in front of me. sorry but if you are being a dumbass, I am going to yell at you, fine or not Central West End. Kind of reminds me of living in NW my first year in Portland -- a lot of fun things going on and young folks hanging out, but as I get to know the city better I'm discovering some neighborhoods that I think I might prefer to live in when my lease is up (e.g. Soulard -- love the architecture there and seems to be less pretentious). How long have you lived here? what if I am obeying the laws just like the rest of the people around me and some asshole gets out of the car and starts verbally assaulting me. holding up traffic and putting both parties in danger. this is not a policy to reward cyclists this is a policy of preventing that kind of shit from happening. if you read the comments on the article, the alderman is replying to questions. The P-D article is not entirely accurate (SURPRISE!) There is nothing in the ordinance about yelling or cursing specifically, only "threatening". As many have said, I, too, yell at other motorists and cyclists for stupid behavior all the live long day, and I can continue to do so as long as it's just a string of curses and not "I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!" Oh yew, CWE and Soulard both seem like neat places. We moved here last August, so we've only been here about 9 months. I am pretty sure that would be breaking laws that are already on the books. I ride a motorcycle, people quite often will change lanes without looking, almost hit me or run me off the road. should it now be ILLEGAL to make mistakes like this. Or this last week, someone 2 cars in front of me emptied their cup of soda out of their car window and I got covered. should this be ILLEGAL. Granted bicyclist do have a shitty end of the stick, however, I think there is a better solution than criminalizing every fucking thing people say or do. just my humble opinion
