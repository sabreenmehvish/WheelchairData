Mr. Okra among Southern Living magazine's Southerners of the Year 2017  When I was little boy in Algiers a man used to go down the block once a week selling fresh shrimp and fish, my grandmother would always buy something and cook it up, those days are pretty much gone and it makes me sad. Drove by his parked car the other night in what I am assuming is his neighborhood and it made me v happy. Heâ€™s an angel.  You can come sit on my porch on Sundays at 11 AM and listen to Mr Okra come up the street. Growing up in Lafayette that was pretty much how we always got shrimp. Not sure if they do it that way anymore. I mean they still have that, they just replaced the shrimp with crack To be fair, in 90 degree heat, that probably wasn't the best idea...but I know what you mean. There used to be a peach man who came around, and my Maw Maw just loved him. Until he's gone....then what?....THEN WHAT? I'll yell at you He passed by yesterday, and it's pretty sad to think about. He embodies the city I remember. I look at a lot of these institutions -- Mr. Okra, that wheelchair woman, cracksaphone... They ain't young. I know it's just part of the passage of time, but we have a lot of living cultural institutions here, and it stinks to think of them not being around anymore. If it wasn't done in by Katrina or gentrification, time will take care of the rest. LOUD NOISES!! "that wheelchair woman" its weird that I know exactly who youre talking about
