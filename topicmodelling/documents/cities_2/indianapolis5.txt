How many of you remember the old white guy, with white hair that had a missing leg, and always strolled around on his wheelchair? I remember as early as being five years old (2000) and seeing this older gentlemen. Whenever he would stroll by I remember that me and my sister would talk to him. He was always so nice and sweet. In 2004 we moved out to Franklin township. In 2011 we had to move back and I know I saw him. 

So I was wondering if anyone else has seen this man since, that is if he hasn't passed away by now, and if anyone remembers that man. I lived between E New York St and E Washington St (46201) if that gives you an idea of the area I remember seeing him in. I frequently see someone missing a leg and in a wheelchair at Shadeland and 21st. Usually around the on/off ramps if the weather is nice.  Does he always have a blanket covering his lap and was he overweight? I see a person, cant tell if he is a woman or man, that sits on the ground at the corner of East Washington St. and Sherman Dr, I think. Across the street from White Castle, I think.  He or she seems to be praying constantly.   Sad. Yes, for the past several weeks I've noticed that man and a lady pushing him in the chair. I don't recall if he was overweight or had a blanket. All I remember as a child is that I would see him that generally area. I'm know sure he had both legs missing or just the one. He definitely has the one missing though. I've met that dude. An american christian sadhu, you don't see a lot of those.
