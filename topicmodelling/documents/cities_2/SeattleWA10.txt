New Metro Access vans no good for mid-sized to large wheelchairs  this is an epic fail. They also can't accommodate people using walkers. "The door height is 56 inches"

Yeah, even if they used a ramp, the ramp ratio wouldnt pass ADA by, I think, x 2.5. 

How did this happen? I have had many issues with ST relating to my disability and have always felt ignored. I dont think people realize how ADA inaccessable a lot of modern postADA King County and Seattle is. Whenever I try to bring complaints, I feel like I get push back.  Iâ€™m honestly not surprised. My younger brother with disabilities used to use access, however, they were unreliable and slow.  Is someone in the program's administration trying to kill/privatize the program by delivering it badly or are they just doing a bad job? Plenty of bike shares available for people who can't ride the van.
