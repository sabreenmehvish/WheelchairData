Missing motorized wheelchair, please keep an eye out  jfc what type of degenerate steals a wheelchair? better yet is it normal practice to just leave the wheelchair behind if you get called to bring a chair bound person to the hospital?? that seems wrong. those things must be a fucking fortune and a half to replace  Can anyone confirm the whereabouts of the Laissez Boys?  You can't fit a wheelchair like that into an ambulance and even if you could there is no way of getting it up into the ambulance. Ems will notify nopd of a bike or wheelchair or whatever it is they are leaving behind.  Hopefully someone found it and took it home for safekeeping and will return it? IDK.
