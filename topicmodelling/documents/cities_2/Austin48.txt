Rickshaw Daily Rental for Buddy with Cancer? Hello Austin! My buddy Jon had been fighting testicular cancer and is finally done with his chemo treatments. He’s been up in Indiana for a couple of months getting treatment and it’s looking promising. He just got back to Texas and wants to join the rest of our gang for annual Sherwood Forest Faire trip. The only problem is, he’ll be too weak to walk everywhere. He has a wheelchair but that would be too difficult on the grounds out there. 

I was wondering if anyone in the Austin area has any type of rickshaw setup that I could rent from you for a day so that I can carry my buddy around the festival.  Thanks. I saw folks in powered wheel chairs getting around just fine there a few weekends ago.  Might be a more practical option to rent one. We pulled a kid in a wagon with minor bumps. You just have to be aware of the path, there are certainly parts that are steeper.  You are an amazing friend. Enjoy the festivities.  Thanks for the heads up, that’s a good idea! I’ll look into renting one of those! I have no idea how much something like that costs to rent.
