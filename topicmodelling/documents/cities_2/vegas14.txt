Best handicap accessible car service/taxi/what ever in the area? Hey everyone, going to be in the area for about 11 days in a couple weeks for work, and I am in a power wheelchair. While I am there I would like to see the sights, unfortunately I can't drive (vehicles) So renting a car is out of the question.  I am looking for a handicap accessible taxi or car service in the area, and I'm wondering if anyone has had any experiences with these. In larger cities I have found handicap accessible Ubers, but I don't want to risk not being able to find someone. Check these out:
