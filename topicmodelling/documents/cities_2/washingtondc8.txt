Just A Brunch Of Nerds: A Nerd Themed Brunch in DC August 12th!!!!!  Interesting choice of start date - I assume at least some portion of the nerds this would primarily appeal to will be on the other side of the city at Otakon... > VENUE IS NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE

How is that still a thing? The ADA is older than the people attending this event.  i am such a nerd guys I originally thought this was a brunch where Nerds candy was part of the menu and now Iâ€™m disappointed.  This venue is only a five minute uber ride from the convention center, and all the Otakon attendees will be staying at hotels nearby.  The producer of this show will also be hosting the Otakon afterparty on Saturday night!  We really want a nice casual monthly event for all nerds in the city, since there really aren't many events/nightlife areas for nerds here. [deleted] Spending a few weeks in Europe has given me a new appreciation of the impact of the ADA on US construction and design.  It doesn't help me personally, but I imagine it's really handy for people in need. Same here. This sounds cool, but I got pumped for a candy brunch before clicking through... We can definitely ask the venue to include some Nerds infused brunch items, lol. Or we may throw in some nerds rope in the raffle drawing. =D See: Georgetown Having to navigate even a stroller around town makes you very aware of the dismal lack of accessibility we have for wheelchair-bound folks.
