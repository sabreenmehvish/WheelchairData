Disabled and going to Sakuracon. Looking to rent a wheelchair either privately or through a reputable company. Any suggestions? Long story short, I have a fused spine from neck to tail bone and a repaired heart valve. I'm going to sakuracon and I'm so, so excited. Unfortunately the reality of my disability had set in and while I can get around my house, I can't do the kind of walking a con demands.

I'm looking to rent a standard hand operated wheelchair for three days. Seattle is usually really helpful and understanding of this stuff so I figured I'd try my luck here. Do any of you know of anyone renting privately or a company that can be trusted without costing hundreds of dollars? Try the Visitor Services folks at the Convention Center - I know I've seen plenty of people in wheelchairs for other events:
