I'm just shocked the murderer ISN'T a homeless crackhead. Wowzers Really really tragic. I worked for this guy. He in no way deserved a fate like this. Wtf.... Horrible [deleted] I'll probably wind up on the bottom of your shoe as you walk through the Tenderloin. [deleted] Actually, I'm an uneducated, homeless crackhead.
