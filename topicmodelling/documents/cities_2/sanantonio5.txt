Help us raise money to help him pay his copay for a new electric wheelchair. It's for a good cause. Any amount will help  Lack of health care is so disgusting. People literally have to beg for charity to not be immobile. Feels like a 3rd world country.  The fact that his copay is freaking 2k is ridiculous. Insurance  is a rip off  Given that the gentleman is disabled, that co-pay is likely the Medicare co-pay. Think about THAT long enough and you'll really get steamed. He actually has medical through his job. He works for santikos Thanks for the clarification. I didn't blow up the picture enough to read the badge on his shirt.

The 80/20 copay on "durable medical" is actually rather common throughout most insurances. While it's great for lower cost items, it really sucks when you hit big-ticket items.
