Wheelchair-friendly New Years Eve ideas? Hi all!  I recently had a pretty bad accident and will be wheelchair-bound for the next couple months. Are there any fun NYE events that won't be too crowded and will be easily wheelchair accessible? (In the past month I've learned that Atlanta IS NOT a very handicapped-friendly city.) Marietta Square?  Free parking in a handicapped accessible garage. Nice crowd, and Glover Park looks pretty handicapped accessible.  Marietta Pizza should be easy to get into.  Some of the other  buildings might be less accessible because they are older than dirt.  Sorry about your accident. I would stay away from the main attractions around town and avoid overcrouded bars. Maybe see if Smyrna or Marietta have something going on within their downtowns?  What kind of accident were you in? Atlanta Botanical Gardens has a lot of wheelchair accessible ramps and a very good light display. [My advice is to take Uber b/c the parking garage gets crowded during the lights.]

I hope you heal soon!
