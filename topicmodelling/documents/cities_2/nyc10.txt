New York Has a Great Subway, if You're Not in a Wheelchair  thats entirely unacceptable to get off a train only to be surprised that the elevator is out of service. they're trapped at that point. this really needs to be addressed. Sadly, it's because installing elevators, especially underground, is extremely expensive. Between 2015 and 2019, the MTA has budgeted $740M for ADA accessibility, which covers just **14** stations. $245M of that is for the the Times Square shuttle platforms at Times Square alone. The other accessibility projects, mostly elevators, range between $6.1M and $59.1M. [source](http://web.mta.info/capital/pdf/MTA_15-19_Capital_Plan_Board_WEB_Approved_v2.pdf#page=188). 

For comparison, that's $148M the MTA is spending on subway accessibility a year, compared to Paratransit, which the MTA will spend $518M on this year, at a net deficit of $321M. Most of that $197M revenue comes from the city budget and metropolitan commuter tax, with about 11% coming from paratransit fares. [source](http://web.mta.info/mta/budget/pdf/MTA%202017%20Adopted%20Budget%20February%20Financial%20Plan%202017-2020.pdf#page=40).

Of course you can't simply get rid of paratransit, but its budget is enough to cover making about 10-15 more stations accessible each year. At that pace, the entire subway system could be made accessible in about 30 years. A fairly ridiculous and long-apparent situation.  Some of the staircases are treacherous in wet weather even for people with no mobility issues.

On the selfish side, better accessibility and working elevators everywhere would mean I can continue to take the stairs at a sprint without getting stuck behind a stroller convoy or a three pack a day smoker. the entire city is pretty brutal for people in wheelchairs. i never noticed how cracked the sidewalk is until i started rolling my old aunt around. i also realized how hostile some businesses can be to people in wheelchairs. we rolled up to some hip brunch joint and they were not pleased. she's 86 with no teeth and a heart of gold. nyc all her life not gonna let some posh dbags trample her spirit. FWIIW NYC is a great city, but not so much if you are in a wheelchair. Accessibility, transit and not, are a big part of the reason we left. 

When it snows it gets shoved to the curbs and corners. People make a person wide opening which is not a scooter wide or a wheelchair wide. When it is dry the sidewalks are a problem. Even where there are cutouts they are uneven and treacherous. And you need cutouts at every corner, not just most.

Then you get fun like a restaurant that says it is accessible. Except the one step to get in. Oh, and the bathroom is down stairs and no elevator. 

And buses really don't like to stop, particularly if it is at all busy.

Cars may be evil, but they are far better for the disabled.

 I know this is a real problem, but I also think it's a problem that the MTA can't do meanginful rehabbing of stations without adding elevators--because it results in those stations just being left completely as they are. It's one thing to require new stations to have good elevator access, but it seems ridiculous that stations built over a century ago and where there's literally no room to put in an elevator are only grandfathered in as long as no changes are made. I broke my leg a few years back and had to take the train daily at the time and it really showed me how inhospitable the subway system is for anyone not 100% physically able to use it. It was a painful, dark experience.  Correct headline: Not a great subway, and even worse  if you're in a wheelchair It's my understanding that the existence of Access-a-Ride is why NYC is exempted from some parts of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

I had hip surgery a couple years ago and briefly had to deal with what some people have to experience all the time. I tried but was unable to sign up for Access-a-Ride. A lousy service that is burdensome to use and rarely comes on time is a terrible substitute for actually accommodating people with disabilities. Every stop should have a working elevator at all times, period. And damn the expense.  [deleted] In hindsight, Mayor Koch was probably right. We've spend millions upon millions updating the subway for the purposes of disabled accessibility and look where it gets us? A system that is hardly better along in this area than it was in the 80s. Should we have instead ramped up efforts in Paratransit? 
 
http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/22/nyregion/koch-blocks-accord-on-subway-access-for-disabled-people.html Not to mention, the elevators that do work are fucking disgusting.  I'm in a wheelchair and temporarily visiting Manhattan for business in a few weeks.

I need to move around, and because the subway sucks, I'll have to pay for a rental car and drive and park throughout the entire city.

What disturbs me the most is that I'll become just another driver, with the same traffic jams, expensive (and lacking) parking spaces (which I'm afraid most will be inaccessible for me as well).

I have to spend a lot of money because the subway situation is embarrassing. AFAIK there's no service or help to make up for that.

Any advice? Sasha is any of us; he is all of us.  Walking through Central Park on his way to work his life was changed.  Let's make NYC the world class city it is and care for all of our residents.    There are some "[stair climbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lb_8nmy90c)"electric chairs but they are still slow and pretty expensive. I dont know if insurance will cover the cost but I agree that  the transit system has forgotten people that use wheelchairs.   Or have kids that needs strollers I interned for the President of NYCT a decade ago, working on how elevator and escalator maintenance teams were divided and where they are based.

During a conversation with the President, he mentioned his efforts in the 1980s to make the bus fleet 100% accessible when he headed NYCT Buses. His reason? He served in combat and was lucky enough to return home uninjured, but many other soldiers were wheelchair-bound for the rest of their lives, and he felt it his responsibility to ensure that the transit system was accessible to them. It's not a great subway even if you're physically able. Some of the tracks are so narrow when it gets crowded people are legit on the edge. Some of the tracks have such little distance between the walls and the edge of the track that people can easily fall off. When it snows even a little bit, most of the outer borough steps are treacherous for even young, fit people. When the elevators do work, they probably smell like piss and shit.  
  
The subway is only great in that it's really easy to use and so available everywhere. If you go to most other countries' major cities their subway is considerably cleaner, more modern, safer, and catered to disabled. I love this city but calling our Subway "great" is a joke.  Our subway is decent at best.  I was in Paris all last week and they have that shit figured out.  And fuck any excuses about NYC being old because Paris is *way* older. Even if you're not in a wheelchair the subway sucks. At least half the time I take it, it stops at some point for train traffic ahead or some other bs. It's light years behind every other modern subway system. Is New York ever going to update/modernize the subways instead of repairs/maintenance? I can't imagine it being like it is for another 100 years. [NY Post](http://nypost.com/2017/04/02/subway-elevators-escalators-are-old-and-perpetually-broken/)  The MTA is horrendous, Astoria Queens has not even one elevator at any of the N/W lines. I don't think handicap people have any way of getting up to the platforms. The "21st Century City" what a pathetic joke Literally who says nyc gas a great subway They never work. New York has a Great Subway... If you Have $3 in your pocket!!! I kinda learned this when I picked up some heavy items including a hand truck from Home Depot, so getting there was fairly easy from Brooklyn to Manhattan, coming back with the stuff? Not so much.  It's not. Worst I've seen. I feel like people don't use the busses enough. You can get just about anywhere and it isn't that much slower on the bus then the train. I do wish the streets were shoveled better in the snow to make things more accessible but it doesn't snow that much anymore.  Why are we wasting our time building elevators when we should be removing every tree from Central Park to ensure something like this never happens again. Then don't take the subway. I remember when the 63rd and Lex train station elevator was out of service. The recommendation for late night was that you take the F down to West 4th to catch the E and then catch some bus. That's just ridiculous. They should be listing those along with any other service interruptions. It's essentially the same thing.  Well they're not TRAPPED, they can just get on the next train but it will be a major inconvenience perhaps disrupting their whole day. Something needs to be done about it.  Toronto's TTC sends out tweets and posts notices in the system if an elevator is down.  It works mostly but if you use a wheelchair you have to pay attention. I have twins. I when I take the subway with them I use an umbrella stroller with one and front carrier with the other and a small backpack for a baby bag, because I am able to take the kid out the stroller and carry the kid in one hand and the stroller in the other and walk up the four flights of stairs after I've walked to the elevator and discovered an out of order sign. It bugs me that it is not posted to the MTA website, because I could choose a different station and if I was leaving with the rest of the passengers someone might offer to help. $245M!? For scale the Kosciuszko Bridge replacement project is $550M. The new R179 trains (300 of them) cost the MTA $599M; they could have bought 122 new trains for the same money.

What is going on there that warrants that cost? I understand construction costs in NYC are expensive, but that's an order of magnitude higher than all the other stations budgeted for. And yet Broadway Junction still won't have ADA compliance. Shameful. As a smoker, I'm amazed that anyone can not only physically smoke more than a pack a day but find the time to do so. Some paths are also just pretty steep. The walk from the ACE Port Authority stop to the NWQR 42nd/Times Sq stop immediately comes to mind, but it's far from the only situation.  I've thought pretty much ever since moving here that if I became wheelchair-bound I'd leave NYC in a heartbeat. The sheer number of places I go on a daily basis that I wouldn't be able to reach is absurd. Entire social groups would be closed off to me on account of the venues we meet in. Meet in someone's apartment on the first floor? Just about every prewar apartment building has three or four steps going into the front door. Of the 7 or 8 places I frequent on a weekly basis, only two are wheelchair-accessible - and those two don't include my apartment (nor would it include any apartment I have lived in or even viewed while apartment hunting).

It's a natural consequence of 90% of the city being build by the 1950's, but I couldn't fathom being handicapped here. A ton of the pedestrian ramps at curbs are even a pain in the ass with a wheelchair. And that's a built ramp!
 Is there anywhere **more** wheelchair friendly than NYC, though? I suppose it depends on your level of immobility but as cracked as the sidewalks are at least services are dense together. I'd rather be in a wheelchair in NY than in a wheelchair in LA. Yeah I can only think of one  bar or restaurant by me that you don't need to take stairs to get inside or to the bathroom. I know of one that has one of those wheelchair lifts. > Cars may be evil, but they are far better for the disabled.

Yeah, I know someone who is confined to a wheelchair, but he has a Dodge Caravan specially modified so he can wheel himself in easily. Much easier than having to deal with public transport. part of the problem is, some stations just have no place to put them. Like at elevated stations w/ center platforms suspended above a street. You sometimes don't have the headroom at the street level to put in the pit needed for the elevator.   
  
>are only grandfathered in as long as no changes are made.  
  
Thats a basic stipulation of the building code, not just subways, and not even just for ADA. Its also true for fire protection and egress, for example.   
  
If suddenly you had to bring up all of NYC to current ADA code, that would be tens of billions of dollars to do so. Then spend hundreds of millions every few years when the codes get updated to go back and do it all again.  The problem is partly political economy; it's an unfunded federal mandate, so it assumes that states, cities, and agencies can get together and hash something out that works for everyone involved. However, the MTA is every politician's favorite punching bag, so it didn't really work out that way here since it's not in their interest to have a functioning MTA that can't be complained about. Just curious, did you use access-a-ride at all in the time that you were injured? Its actually free to anyone who applies with a mobility restricting injury. Totally agree. People have such low expectations to be honest Acess-A-Ride is horrible. And it was getting far worse when we left the city. Accessibility was a big piece of why we moved out of NYC.  [deleted] > It's just not possible. We would need 10's of billions and decades. 

We've had decades. They could feasibly - if not quite *easily* - put together a plan to make more stations accessible as they do standard renovations and maintenance. They don't do this. You could go in and out the window. Once. Just out. I had a roommate a few years back who only "officially" started dating a girl because he had to get surgery on his knee and she had an elevator. 

Unsurprisingly, four years later, she is still waiting for him to propose even though they are now both in their 30s. He probably still cheats regularly. [paratransit is incredibly expensive and generally inefficient, though.] (http://www.oneidadispatch.com/article/OD/20160921/NEWS/160929934)

 Uber has an accessible ride service: https://www.uber.com/nyc-riders/products/uberwav/

And a certain percentage of taxis are required to have wheelchair ramps but I'm guessing that it's like finding a needle in a haystack.

Best of luck. 100% of NYC's bus system is accessible. Yes, it takes more time to get around than the subway, but given the choice I'd take the bus over trying to find parking any day. So you'd like to propose a 0.5% sales tax?  It's bizarre how far behind NYC is and how the political will to improve anything doesn't appear to exist. Even the MTA's [website](http://www.mta.info/) feels decades out of date compared to [Hong Kong](http://www.mtr.com.hk/ch/customer/main/index.html), [London](https://tfl.gov.uk/), etc Paris has their shit so figured out that 288 of their 303 metro stations DO NOT have elevators.  There are two stations on the 1 line, two on the 2 line, two on the 13 line, and nine on the 14 line (new line, opened in 1998).  Unlike NYC, which has been gradually shoehorning elevators into old stations (at massive expense), Paris has made virtually no effort to make old stations accessible.  
  
Only around 25% of London Underground stations are accessible, slightly better than NYC.  There are PLENTY of things you can point to London and Paris as far superior to NYC when it comes to transit (namely the fact that they didn't spend 3 decades allowing their systems to basically rot); this isn't really one of them. right, but they shut down completely for several hours every night. Thats a lot of time to to maintenance and construction that NYC doesnt have. The Paris line doesn't have to run 24/7 like the New York one.

The New York one is 236 miles long, where the Paris one is 133 so there is less to maintain. 1. The city is older, the subways are roughly the same age. 

2. Paris *in general* is way less accessible than NYC. I will never forget watching parents struggle to carry their child's motorized wheelchair up the stairs to the third floor of a McDonald's, because that's where the bathroom was.  

I guess it's a signaling issue? They updated their systems and we didn't. For example, Paris has fewer problems with people holding the doors and I suspect this is because the trains can run every 2-3 minutes, all day. The subway runs a lot more smoothly when the train doesn't have to sit in the station during repeated attempts to close the doors. They also have invested in doors on the platform, which isn't an option in NYC since we sometimes have different trains running on the same line, but completely eliminates the issue of people jumping or falling onto the tracks. London's subway is definitely older than NYC's,  and they have that shit figured out too. Too many excuses for mediocrity here  No. Astoria Boulevard is getting one sometime in the next couple years I bet one of the 4 million or so people who use it daily will think so. Probably a tourist, and me. Idk who this "nyc gas" is, but he's a jerk. They have a subway. Yeah, good reason to start biking. :-/ they sort of do.

http://advisory.mtanyct.info/EEoutage/

there is also an email list as well.  

Partner had to use a cane after a bad accident and surgery so i was curious about it.  At the time, it was updated fairly well.   [deleted] Would probably save space on the notice if they list the ones that's working. The DC metro reports elevator outages.  Yea, surprising, but I looked into it and it's much more than just a few elevators or ramps. 

>This project will modify and extend the platform to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) requirements. The station will be reconfigured from three-track to two-track shuttle
operations for six-car trains and addition of second means of egress at east end of platform to
mitigate congestion and provide a connection to the 6th Avenue Line. Project also includes
modifications at Grand Central-42 St to accommodate the new shuttle operation. Additional station
reconfiguration options will be explored during design. To be coordinated with reconstruction project
at station.

**tl;dr:** Get rid of the 3rd track, lengthen trains/platforms from 4 to 6 cars, make ADA accessible, add exit at 6th Avenue, and transfer to B/D/F/M. For that amount money, wouldn't it be cheaper for the MTA to just have subsidized vouchers for disabled riders for taxis with wheelchair capabilities? Hell, for $245m can probably just hire full time workers to carry people up the stairs. Heck give me a million/year and I'll be on call to be at a station before a disabled person arrives and I'll carry them up myself. It's real easy to smoke a shit ton if you work outdoors and can just smoke all fucking day. i dont know because i dont live anywhere else and i am not in a wheelchair myself. i dont think NYC has to be the worst place in order to recognize that it isnt a good place to have a disability in. what is your point? if you arent in a wheelchair you probably shouldnt be but making these judgments - but listening. SF? LA? > part of the problem is, some stations

Right, that's what I said...it's ridiculous that there's not even an exemption for stations where it's literally not possible to put them in. Bet that quote would hit the hundreds of billions if not a trillion. Half the city would need to be raized.  It is not free it is still a full fair $2.75 per ride in cash can't use a metro card. You also have to schedule all your rides the day before. Often you have to share the ride so you can get on and they will make a bunch more pick up and drops before you get to your destination.

Also the application process is a huge pain, you might not even get Access-A-Ride by the time a broken leg heals. Access-a-ride? Never heard of it, I can think of more than a few times friends or family could've really used it.  No, I had no idea that you could use that to be honest. I just sort of suffered through the whole thing (I live on the 5th floor of a walk-up too! To this day, this is why I know the amount of stairs it takes to walk up to my apartment all because of that period of time!)

Good to know though for the future! Poor people ruin everything, if it weren't for them I'd be rich. [deleted] I actually miss stairs when I travel.  So you're damned if you do and damned if you don't? What kind of argument is that? I'm told it's possible to schedule accessible cab rides via 311. So lame dude. I'm discussing my view on our values as a society.  How we raise revenue to fund our priorities is a worthy but different conversation.  We should always talk about our values as a society and how they translate into priorities. Yeah maybe this wasn't the right article on which to make this comment.  My impression of the Paris subway has everything to do with speed, efficiency, and cleanliness and *nothing* to do with accessibility. That's something that's always important to bring up - NYC has the only 24/7 subway system in the world. That's a big part of why repairs take so long. Well he didn't say there wasn't a reason, just that theirs is better than NYC That was a bad surprise for 18 year old me stumbling out of a Pigalle bar on my first night and trying to drunkenly find the way back to my apartment in the 17th.  Speaking selfishly as a privileged person who does not have to work the graveyard shift, I would accept limited hours for their speed and efficiency without hesitation. Well he didn't say there wasn't a reason, just that theirs is better than NYC

 Why can't they replace the train service with a bus service at night like they do in other cities?

There are less people so you don't need train capacities, there is less traffic on the surface so traffic shouldn't be an issue either.
 "Run 24/7" as in close a lot of trains and stations on weekends. Using the subway on the weekends is not a nice experience. We have 840 miles of track here, Frenchie. Somehow Parisians manage just fine without it running 24/7. > the trains can run every 2-3 minutes, all day.

This was the main thing that stood out to me, along with better corridors to direct traffic through stations.  But the regularity of the trains was just incredible.

FWIW the doors on the platform was only one line that I saw. I assume it's on multiple but I did not see it often. Having lived in both cities, I will take the subway over the Tube any day of the week.

The subway system has almost twice as many stations and covers a much smaller geographic area, meaning you can get around more easily. The Tube isn't air-conditioned, and even though it rarely gets hot enough in London for it to matter, when it does, it is fucking miserable as shit. The Tube also doesn't run 24/7, though they have just introduced limited 24/7 on certain lines in central London. Most stations close at 11PM or 12AM if I recall correctly.

The only thing things about the Tube that immediately stand out as being superior to the subway are that it's *much* cleaner and every station has estimated train times. Are you kidding me? London had the shit bombed out of it during WWII meaning infrastructure is much newer.

NYC has to deal with legacy shit, and its system is MUCH MUCH better than the Tube. 24/7 service for one thing. No they don't. The tube is even worse for accessibility, and it's even more difficult to make it so because of how deep so many of the lines were built. It's an engineering nightmare. [deleted] *almost 6 million. No take uber > they sort of do.

Sort of as in the sometime do but rarely. They should make the fare 12 bucks and use the money to repair That's really interesting and makes a lot more sense. Thank you for looking into that! Wait there's going to be a connection between 42nd/Bryant Park and the Times Square shuttle platform? So you'll be able to walk from 6th Avenue to 8th Avenue without leaving the system? Why can't they just close the shuttle and beef up 7 line service?  As the OP mentioned, there's other work included in that price that is probably required work for ADA compliance, but improves the experience for all rides. For example, the lengthening if the S train from 4 cars to 6 and additional egress points to preclude crowding. In other words the $245M is not just for making space for and installing elevators.

These are definitely welcomed​ improvements for all riders. That's stupid. If having a disability didn't make it harder to live your life, it wouldn't be a disability, though. I think NYC is probably one of the better places in America (with the caveat that we as a country are behind a whole lot of other places) to be in a wheelchair or otherwise mobility impaired due to our geography and density. In some cases there can be. The reconstruction of Smith-9th didn't add elevators.  One of the main reasons for lowering the bonus, but keeping the base fare at $2.75 was that it benefitted Access-a-ride customers who can't benefit from the bonus due to the cash requirement. Access-a-Ride is unnecessarily horrible and is not free. The less fortunate get all the breaks!

There are other ways to pay for legally mandated upgrades than fare hikes. [deleted] Yeah, I like burning the extra calories. 

Also very curious what I said that was worthy of the downvotes. Oh well.  Views on society aren't going to fund should haves and supposed to be Fair game on that then.  Also, the RER is what NJ Transit/Metro North/LIRR should look like.  
  
It's really a shame that we allowed ourselves to get so far behind in the game in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, and even today you still have a huge chunk of politicians here who value driving and parking much more than transit. You shouldn't call it 24/7 when major stations are shut down regularly on weekends fast track? It shuts down whole sections at a time. Please use the next excuse.  [deleted] We already do. Because even though there are less people on the subways late at night, it's still pretty crowded, especially on high traffic lines.  A train line like the L train runs every 20 minutes or so late at night, and is still packed with people even at 4am.  You would need an army of buses to replace the subway no matter when it was.  Also many bus lines would have crazy routes to replace them, because there isn't necessarily a bridge that follows the subway line so they'd have to go way out of the way just to get back to where the line continues. From Wikipedia: "Overall, the system contains 236 miles (380 km) of routes,[6][8] translating into 665 miles (1,070 km) of revenue track;[8][9] and a total of 850 miles (1,370 km) including non-revenue trackage."

I was trying to compare apples to apples with the Paris subway.  I'm actually a New Yorker. Paris is a quaint village compared to NYC New York isn't Paris. Paris has a Gross Metropolitan Product of basically half that of New York's. 

 They were in the process of installing it on Line 1 when I was abroad there six years ago. I was there again last April and saw it on a few more, though I'm sure you're right that it hasn't reached all the stations. But can you imagine what a difference it'd make if we could get those even just on the 456, 7 and L? Go on the IRT in rush hour and you get about the same headway (assuming some joker hasn't held up the entire line on a (6) train twenty stations away from you). Oh man the intra station foot traffic. I had been taking the J to canal for years and it was never an issue. I have to take an L to a 6 now and the transfer at Union sq is fucking murder.  And the Oyster Card is flipping fantastic compared to the MetroCard. So many stations shut down on weekends you can't say it's easy to get around in NYC nor is it 24/7 Does the tube still have wooden escalators? The tube has a lot of design flaws like the cramped trains and overly deep stations, but given the circumstances they've done a much better job at modernizing their system and keeping up with current standards  Yet another excuse for mediocrity, since plenty of other developed (and developing) countries have overcome similar or greater logistical challenges- and have built much better systems than ours  [deleted] Are you good, no one would pay that much they would rather go on uber Delete this nephew Yes. As far east as 42nd and 5th if you use the passageway to the 7, actually. 7 service already runs at near-maximum frequency in Manhattan. There isn't enough room for the shuttle riders to take the 7 during the rush hour. I have to disagree with that.

As long as you are able to operate a car, the suburbs would be much easier. Most suburban strip malls have been built recently, meaning that they should be handicap accessible. Also, assuming you live in a house, a wheelchair ramp shouldn't be too hard to install. i cant speak for other places in america - but unless you live in an elevator building, have someone with you to help you in the streets, and can afford cabs everywhere... it's not that easy. density isnt a plus. people, for the most part, treat you like a burden or a barrier on the street. re: geography -- i guess you're saying it isn't as hilly as it could be? not much of a conciliation prize.

edit: maybe i should qualify better what i meant about cracks in the sidewalk... in the wheelchair you feel *every* bump. for my old aunt, it is really disturbing for her. she groans every crack and gets *nervous.* 

protip to anyone out there new to pushing wheelchairs -- go backwards on large cracks and bumps. the larger wheels make a smoother transition. my initial thought was to jump curbs... lol. turns out the elderly aren't that extreme.
 There was [discussion](http://secondavenuesagas.com/2013/04/30/on-smith9th-sts-and-ada-compliance/) about whether NYCT had skirted the rules in that case. The comments provide some extra information. As a pedestrian, their drivers are often *nuts* when it comes to traffic, too. No, its just because elevators are fucking expensive and break all the time.

Its not like the MTA is installing them... the subcontractors are. Take into account that you might need to make major changes to station mezzanines and/or platforms in order to get elevator service all the way up to the street. For example, where do you put the elevators on the elevated lines? Or maybe you'll need to rework the width of the sidewalk to fit an elevator, which might require redoing parts of the street. Also, for stations that don't have a mezzanine you might need to widen the platforms to fit the elevator and be ADA compliant.

That's a lot of work just to find a place to put the elevator. That's your personal value judgement that they are "should haves and supposed to be".  The purpose of democracy is it is a system to deal with the fact that you have different priorities and values than I do. That is only a recent phenomenon, and one can't just shut down half a platform for a few weeks to install an elevator when commuters need to use it the next morning! Change that I am privileged?  Or change that I'm selfish?

The selfish comment was tongue in cheek. I don't really want to make life more difficult for thousands of people just so I can catch a train faster. 

The privileged thing is just a fact of life that can't be changed. I guess I could voluntarily quit my job and put myself in a worse situation but obviously I'm not going to do that.  Mmm? I take the A train often at night, around 2 am, from 14th st. to 81st. It's never packed. There are at most 10 ppl per car. Less than that when I go back later.

It's different on Friday/Saturday night, but during the week it is definitely not packed.
It'd be interesting to take a look at MTA data to  check how many ppl are actually on the trains at night vs during the day.

Out of curiosity, which tunnels are you thinking of that don't have a bus accessible way next to them? I don't give two fucks what you are - they are completely different animals. Unlike you, I knew we had enough track to reach Chicago without looking at wikifuckea. Moral of the story... Suce ma bite, la France! You really don't get it until you've been there.  I can't believe I forgot that. You're absolutely right. [deleted] Except they don't report the outages in real time. The experience of those in wheelchairs differs from the reports.
 I have lived in NYC and in the suburbs in a wheelchair.  It's true that more businesses are accessible in the suburbs, but as someone who does not drive, I prefer NYC.  Where I live bus transportation is limited in frequency.  We also have cracked sidewalks, uneven curb cuts, snow dumped in the curb cuts. I don't have a house, and not always easy or inexpensive to install a ramp - and would also have to make the bathroom accessible.  If you live in a suburb where there is a lot of post-1991 reconstruction, it's not hard to find an accessible apartment. Where I live, there are only a handful of newer places and some of these are out of reach for lower income people.  If I could afford the rent in a newer building in NYC, I would move there in a second.  When I go there, I use the bus, push the chair depending on how far I have to go. Only tried the subway once and the gaps between the track and platform were scary.  I love the density of NYC and being able to get everywhere.  I don't buy this argument that they break all the time. My building has 25 elevators. Rarely is one of them out of service. 

Maybe they're getting maintained on nights and weekends, but the MTA could do that too. [deleted] [deleted] Well, should haves and supposed to be is what caused huge amounts of funding to be driven into ADA refurbishments which have been very expensive, overrun on costs, still way behind schedule while being the most accessible system in the world. 

Voters and their morality say every station should be disability accessible, larger and larger amounts of funding goes toward it to the degradation of the rest of the system. 

People saying it should be a certain way without an accompanying funding increase means that normal programs will necessarily be reduced. 

Considering all of that why would you be against a 0.5% sales tax to fund it completely? 

Is it because you want things but don't like increased taxes?  This thread was about repairs. The post is about elevators. I was only making a point that the '24/7' argument is flawed because sections are shut down for extended periods of time. I don't understand why people are mta apologists.  hey.. pssst... you suck I have. Of the ~40 countries i have traveled to, Paris (i will admit, other parts of France are fine) is the one city i have no desire to ever return to. Which is why I got super excited when I heard the same firm that implemented the Oyster Card was going to replace the MetroCard. > They want a summer and winter vacation home instead of just one or the other, they want a well padded retirement fund, they want to get Starbucks three times a day instead of taking a thermos with them. They want the several hundred dollar designer sun-glasses instead of Foster Grants.

Are you spouting off these big bad rich people cliches because you think they pay for it with the money that would go to public transportation construction? Elevators in the subway break all the time. An apartment building or office tower has to deal with far fewer people, potentially, has dedicated maintenance staff and there probably aren't homeless people shitting in them. My building has two and several times a week one of them is being iffy  Also would have accepted homeslice.   > while being the most accessible system in the world

Did you not read the article? The whole point is that it's not actually accessible.

Sales tax and increased fares are regressive taxes. So no, I wouldn't be in favor of a sales tax hike.

The point of the article is that the MTA is under-reporting outages and misrepresenting the accessibility of the subway. Let's start with more transparency and accountability. Because without the MTA, New York would not exist as the powerhouse of a city that it does today. In the 2005 strike we got a taste of no subway service for several days. The city lost $400 million a *day* and the city's general productivity loss was immeasurably higher, easily into the billions. We *need* the MTA and we need to encourage them to do the right things whenever we can. Individual sections are shut down - because we have got to make those repairs - but the system as a whole is running.

It is the MOST accessible of any city of its size and it also runs 24/7. 
The fact that it isn't 100% accessible is irrelevant because no modern city of that size is 100% accessible. Not even close. 

Did you not read what I wrote?

Yet you think more should be done to make stations accessible. Where do those resources come from? General budget which is already strained? 


>The point of the article is that the MTA is under-reporting outages and misrepresenting the accessibility of the subway. Let's start with more transparency and accountability. 

It's still the most accessible system in the world for its size. In addition to train outrages they also list accessibility outages but it isn't as easy to identify and indicate an outage considering how many fewer people use those accessibility features. 

More transparency and accountability isn't free. People are doing what they're doing with existing funding. More notifications and transparency in such an agency means more funding unless you want to pull from general budget. 

Someone somewhere has to pay. Should it be tax payers? General transit riders who see resourced go towards expensive projects they might never use? 

You can just say there should be more transparency and accountability while keeping funding levels the same because that will necessarily pull from other areas.  But why even (so bitterly) mention what you think they spend their incomes on?
