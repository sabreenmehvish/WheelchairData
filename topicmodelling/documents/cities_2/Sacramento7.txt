Recommendations for a visitor to Sacramento with early-stage ALS? I've lived in Sacramento for a few years now, now Elk Grove, and now my parents are coming out to visit in May from the other side of the countryt.  Dad was recently diagnosed with ALS which, for now, means that his motor functions are impaired and he is easily tired (eight hours/day of light activity and he's done).  They're coming out in May, but I want to have every detail of the trip planned out ahead of time to make it as enjoyable as possible for he and my mother.  Here are his main interests/hobbies:

* Homebrewing + Beer
* Woodworking
* R/C airplanes + Aviation
* Farming
* Master electrician for 20+ years
* Sushi + Japanese food
* Korean food

... but I'm primarily looking for easy, wheelchair accessible things to do.  (He's not in a wheelchair - yet - but it's a possibility.)

My ideas so far:

* Various breweries around Sacramento (which ones?)
* Aviation museum
* Farming museum
* Gunther's Ice Cream
* Oz Korean BBQ
* Bonchon in Elk Grove

Thank you /r/Sacramento! Dorothea Puente’s F Street boarding house. I know everyone rolls their eyes, but the Railroad Museum is a lot of fun. Everyone I've been with ends up enjoying it. would definitely hit up track 7 on west pacific ave near curtis park; a great local brewery in a larger warehouse that is definitely wheelchair accessible. they have a different food truck that comes by every day from the late afternoon into the evening.  There's an RC airplane airport of some kind way out towards the back end of like Zinfandel or something like that.  Oz is nice, but there's other good Korean you might want to look into depend on what sort of Korean experience he wants.

[YD House](https://m.yelp.com/biz/yd-house-sacramento) is another one which my wife and I enjoy which isn't a BBQ. Rivercats baseball game, Kings basketball, or sac republic soccer (assuming the season is still going for the last two).

Crocker art museum or tour the Capitol.

There’s a automotive museum near the river downtown.

Absent the train museum, I would avoid old Sac, cobblestone streets and large wood sidewalks are difficult to maneuver. The train museum however is at the end and has a ramp. 

I would also avoid the gold rush towns/foothills because they tend to be steep. 

You could do an SF or Tahoe day trip.  Railroad Museum in Old Sac - Plenty of space and lots of spots to stop and rest and just look around.

R/C Country on Folsom Blvd - great R/C gear and window. Fun to browse

Track 7 Brewery (Natomas, Curtis Park and soon East Sac)

The Heidrick Ag History Museum (Woodland)

Fry's Electronics (just as a time waster, not sure if they have anything like that where they are)

Folsom Powerhouse Museum https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=501



 For the electrical stuff - get an industrial grow house tour. Crazy 3phase 440v LED systems, self-priming loop siphons, novel HVAC and humidity control. I'm sure you could probably make some connections on this here subreddit.

Along the same lines, the Sierra Nevada "eco" tour is pretty rad if you get one of the more knowledgeable tour guides... hydrogen fuel cells with waste heat capture, waste gas capture, etc. Good shit.


For RC stuff, theres those guys that due the nighttime drone flying out at the old Natomas Field. R/C Country for window shopping.


For KBB, Oz is good and better for groups (probably more accessible too) but my favorite is Sa Rang Bang Go to YOLO Brewing and do the brew your own beer thing there. If you tell them your situation they can recommend something and help you out. They make the beer with you and help you craft a recipe and show you how to do everything. You guys should have a great time and you can drink beer while you brew which is fun.

http://www.yolobrew.com/bop/ Oh yeah, one other thought since my MIL was also in a similar situation (wheelchair, but not necessarily ALWAYS wheelchair) when she visited - it wasn't mentioned since people were focused on the local stuff, but if he enjoys the outdoors and can handle a longer drive, Yosemite absolutely has some wonderful views which don't involve a hike - just stay to the valley floor and up at Glacier Point.

Still worth the trip, particularly if you can swing it on a weekday to avoid the crowds. Didn't know about that.  Thanks! I've wanted to do the Railroad Museum in Roseville since I moved here.  I'll run it by him, thanks! Is this your first post into this sub? Everyone in this sub raves about the Railroad Museum and suggest it constantly! We consider it one of our best and more popular attractions. Just looked that up, Track 7 seems like something he'd definitely enjoy.  The food truck variety looks cool too -- thanks! I would agree with this. Also Bike Dog in West Sac. Hmmm, he won't be able to bring anything with him, but maybe we could catch other people flying some expensive toys.  Thanks! That looks nice!  I've added it to my list, thanks. I also like aura on 14th and G.  Is this a... what day is this? I think they’re referring to the train museum in old town?  That looks neat -- I've added it to my list for him to check out.  Thanks!
