ADA Seating at Mercedes-Benz Stadium Might be heading to an event there, but the website is very vague on where the wheelchair accessible seating is and how good of a view it is. The phone number really didn't have anything else but the basic information that's on the website.  There are different wheelchair seating areas around the stadium.  I've seen sections in the 100s and 300s and in both cases, they are at the front of the section, with the best views at that level. You need to call Ticketmaster. Different events have different seating. There are elevators on all levels and wheelchair seating on each level.  This. You can also go to the ATL stadium website, punch in any seat number, and see the real rendered view as if you were sitting in the seat.  Ticketmaster is useless at that. All they can do is give you section number, not if you can actually see anything. I've had tickets are ADA Seating behind people standing. Or a short walk up stairs.
