[Meetup] Eat, Drink, Be Happy, Golden Bull, Thurs 8 May 19:30 Run to the Bull for a night away: come to our relaxed weekly meetup to decompress, chat, and celebrate it almost being Friday.  There are consistently at least 7 of us hanging out, but in the age of the Facebook "maybe", the only certain attendee is [this beardy fellow](http://i.imgur.com/e9ybViF.jpg) (my name is Nick).  7:30 is when the hordes migrate to the theaters, so it’s usually quiet enough to talk.  We usually wind down somewhen between 10 and 11.

**This week is at [The Golden Bull](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-golden-bull-oakland-2),** the newly reopened bar at [412 14th Street](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1556185446#map=19/37.80418/-122.27038).  That’s within stumbling distance of the 14th and Franklin exit of the 12th Street Bart.  In fact, if they threw you out the front door, you might fall down the Bart stairs.  They are wheelchair-friendly, take credit cards and have a [full bar](http://thegoldenbullbar.com/#), but no food.

Your best bet **to find us** is to start looking by the bar.  If we’re anywhere hidden or move around, I’ll try to put an update here.  For a better way to find us,

* Look for my [exceedingly pointy bicycle helmet](http://i.imgur.com/b6JIHqD.png) in a hopefully conspicuous place (probably a tabletop or bartop, but maybe under my arm).
* PM me and I can send you my google voice number and/or my IRC nick, either of which will push notifications to my phone

For those interested, there are more events posted to:

* [bayarea google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sfredditors) (has something almost every day)
* [bayarea facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/205326729493152/) (more weekend oriented?) Ah, the Golden Bull. First bar I ever got a blow job while sitting in one of the booths. But that was back before it closed down years ago, I imagine none of you will be sitting in the same spot... Hell yeah, I gotta work but have fun! Oh yeah pretty sure we met at fuana! See around dude Thanks for sharing?
 That was just the first? Way to take the bull by the horns. You're welcome? Yes.
