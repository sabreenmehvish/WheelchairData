A simple map shows just how shitty the subway system is for people using wheelchairs  And that's why the MTA runs the door to door [Access-A-Ride](http://web.mta.info/nyct/paratran/guide.htm#what_is) program. I love how the G train just doesn't exist. [deleted] Even if I was in a wheelchair, I wouldn't use those disgusting elevators. /r/MapPorn  The subway is shitty for people not in wheelchairs too. It's just a massive pile of fail on a daily basis. Access a ride sucks too.  Yeah, really convenient that you have to schedule every trip 24-48 hours in advance and they will arrive or pick you up within a 2 hour window. Imagine being an hour late or early to everything. It sucks your time and no sane person would ever hire you.  Hey now, you can get on it via elevator at Church Ave, ride it to Court Square, take it back to Church Ave. and then call a taxi because there's only one elevator on the G Line. We can eliminate Access-a-Ride and use that savings to retrofit every cab with a wheelchair lift, and then use the additional savings to give every user cellphones to hail said cabs. 

 > Spend a few trillion dollars and retrofit the entire subway line?

Well... Shouldn't we? It's not like we have to do it all at once, but what's the argument against starting? > you cannot cater to everyone

Says the persons not in a wheelchair. Must be nice. You'd have no choice.  Oh please. Compare this system to the rest of America and nothing comes close. Sure DC is good but it doesn't go to outer neighborhoods as much as ours does and doesn't run 24h. Same for SF.  Yeah but how else can you get from one end of the city to the other for only $2.75? Per-user funding of the subway is much lower than per-user funding of airports and roads. This inequity is why the subway has issues.

Then again, I wouldn't totally agree that it's a "massive pile of fail". What is the rationale behind that statement? Cool, the MTA equivalent of All Lives Matter. cue the transplants who love and defend the subway who will say 'but it runs 24/7 its the best in the wooooorld' Never took it but their drivers are the absolute worst.  Speeding, accelerating hard as if diesel were free, stopping in the middle of the street to drop someone off who doesn't need a ramp or anything, where they could have pulled over to a curb up ahead with 5 car lengths' worth of space, taking "passenger cars only" routes.  I hope they at least come cheap to the city. Resources aren't infinite and imo there are much better uses of transit money.

* Finish the 2nd ave line
* update existing infrastructure (including the already janky as fuck elevators)
* provide subsidized metrocards to low income individuals.
* connect Staten Island to Brooklyn
* create new stations in the outer boroughs

I believe all MTA buses are wheelchair accessible. Buses may not be as convenient as the subway, but that doesn't mean we should make building and maintaining another 1000 public toilets a priority.

 [deleted] I could not use the subway, and stick to buses and access a ride. Not EVERYBODY gives in to the MTA, you know. Having spent hours in traffic in Dallas, I'll defend the subway 'til I stroke out in a car due to road rage. cue the natives who have to remind everyone of their native status at any opportunity >I hope they at least come cheap to the city.

Each Access-A-Ride costs taxpayers an average of $67.33 a trip. 

Might as well give the handicapped smartphones with Uber.

Edit: Source - http://nypost.com/2014/04/20/mta-denying-access-a-ride-to-some-riders-claiming-disabilities/ There are far more people in wheel chairs than with iron lungs. were not the ones ruining this town It's costs more to run than MNR. [deleted] Yeah just like we ruined the subway. All I hear you doing is complaining. A line must be drawn somewhere, of course. I think people in wheelchairs are far more normal than people with iron lungs though. Hell, buildings are required to have wheelchair access. [deleted] > New construction does

Where is the law for this? Either way, this city is built really poorly for people in wheelchairs. Sometimes sidewalks won't even be accessible to wheelchairs.
