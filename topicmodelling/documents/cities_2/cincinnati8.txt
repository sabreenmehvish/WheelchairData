My former highschool raised enough money to buy our teacher a new wheelchair, in two days! Made me tear up  Onions. So proud to be an alum, and to see the class that you guys have shown in supporting one of the greatest teachers.  Always remember TIHSO We got the bear.  Man I loved Kirch. Glad he's still kicking. This guy could use some help getting a wheelchair he can use, a signal boost for his page.
