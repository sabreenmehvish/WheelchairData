shout-out to a badass Shockoe wheelchair jockey, you made my day Earlier this evening as I was driving down Pear Street (at the far east end of Cary, connecting Main and Dock Streets), I saw you, a gentleman in a wheelchair pushing yourself up the very steep hill, towards Main. You made steady (but not slow) progress upwards, as a train crossed the street below.    

For an instant I considered offering you some kind of help, but I realized you were doing this very much intentionally. You were obviously in shape (aka totally ripped), and no one would just do that on a lark. Since my imagination runs a little wild, I did take the liberty of positioning my car behind you (down at the bottom of the hill, as I waited for the train to clear the crossing) such that if you had somehow slipped backwards, you would have rolled into my stationary car rather than the moving train. But no need, of course.    

You confidently wheeled yourself up the hill as I watched in my rear-view mirror, and allowed yourself just one quick backwards glance once you'd summitted. I get the idea you do this often, but it was a bit of a treat for me. I felt like I had just watched an Olympic event crossed with a death-defying action movie stunt scene.    

Wow. Kudos to you, random strongman. You are clearly an extremely tough guy. thanks. that was me.  next time give me a hand, eh? I'm pretty gullible, therefore sadly unable to tell if you're just fucking with me. if you're serious, let me know because I live right there and would be more than happy to give you a ride next time ;) sorry I erred on the side of leaving you alone this time. if you're not serious, well, you have a point anyway. I hope this is true but unlikely given the nature of the interwebs and the brief look at post history

pallarand... Sorry your hockey team sucks... Go Pens!  :P
