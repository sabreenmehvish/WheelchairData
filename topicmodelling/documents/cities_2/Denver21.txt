Annual PSA: Rules for Operating Low-Power Scooters in Denver Some of the rules for operating a Low-Power Scooter (less than 50 CCs) in Denver:  

- Under [Den. Rev. Mun. Code § 54-1](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIIREMUCO_CH54TRRE_ARTIINGE_S54-1DE), Low Power Scooter is defined as "a self-propelled vehicle designed primarily for use on the roadways with not more than three (3) wheels in contact with the ground, no manual clutch, and either of the following: (I) A cylinder capacity not exceeding fifty cubic centimeters if powered by internal combustion; or (II) A wattage not exceeding four thousand four hundred seventy-six (4,476) if powered by electricity. Low-power scooter shall not include a toy vehicle, bicycle, electrical assisted bicycle, wheelchair, or any device designed to assist mobility impaired people who use pedestrian rights-of-way." 

- [Register](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/low-power-scooter) your low powered scooter with the State using this [application](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2701.pdf).  The cost is under $6, and you will receive a registration decal that is valid for three years.  Note, you must carry insurance and provide proof of insurance with your application.  

- You must have a valid drivers’ license per [Colo. Rev. Stat. § 42-2-103(2)(b)](http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2008a/sl_35.htm).

- [Colo. Rev. Stat. § 42-2-103(2)(b)](http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2008a/sl_35.htm) permits low-power scooters (i.e., less than 50 CCs) to be operated in the bicycle lanes upon the roadways.  The statute states the following:  **“Low-power scooters may be operated upon roadways . . . and in bicycle lanes included within such roadways.”**  That means, for example, a person can operate a low powered scooter in the bicycle lane on Stout Street, but it does not mean that a person can operate it on the Cherry Creek Trail (because it is not part of the roadway).  - Note, although Denver prohibits motor vehicles from using or entering the bicycle lane, low powered scooters are not considered motor vehicles pursuant to [Den. Rev. Mun. Code § 54-1(38)](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTIINGE_S54-1DE).  The code states, **“motor vehicle . . . does not include low-power scooters.”**

- Low-power scooters can be parked on the sidewalks.  A low-power scooter may be ridden on the sidewalk, for the purposes of parking the vehicle, from the roadway nearest to the point of parking on the sidewalk. A low-power scooter must not exceed a speed limit of six (6) miles per hour when on the sidewalk or what is reasonable under the existing conditions. The low-power scooter must yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian traffic.  [Den. Rev. Mun. Code 54-184](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTVIOPVE_DIV3RI-W_S54-184LWESCSI).  

- Under C.R.S. § 42-2-127, low-power scooters must not exceed the posted speed limit, and under no circumstance can a person operate a scooter at more than 40 MPH.

- Eye protection is required when operating a low-powered scooter.  E.g., [Den. Rev. Mun. Code 54-630](https://www.municode.com/library/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTXMO_S54-630EYPRRE).  Although a helmet is not required, it is highly recommended.  

Enjoy your scooter and the beautiful weather!  See you on the road!  

EDIT: As u/doebedoe clarified, these rules do NOT apply to kick scooters like the Lime scooters, which fall under the rules for Toy Vehicles; toy vehicles may not enter the roadway except to cross a street at a cross walk.  Happy scooting! Nah I’m going to ride them like a dick and leave them in front yards.  Someone has to fulfill this description to make the incessant bitching accurate.   I'm trying to get a low powered scooter club together.  Anyone know of one already or would like to join? I appreciate this post. But if this is meant to help users regarding the use of stand\-up electric scooter like Lime, this post is about the wrong category of vehicles.

T[his powerpoint produced by the State](http://www.colorado.gov/DOR/documents/Definition_Tool_for_Vehicles_with_Three_Wheels_or_Less.pps) shows the regulations you're referring to for low power scooter are sit\-down scooters equipped with turn signals, lights, etc, and can go nearly 2x as fast as the Lime scooters.

Lime scooters are stand\-up electric scooters, and would fall under this slide on ["toy vehicles"](https://i.imgur.com/b6BsDD7.jpg) which show a motorized stand up scooter. These vehicles are not designed for road use, and are not currently legal on any public road ways \(which includes bike paths and lanes\) and are not legal on sidewalks if motorized \([Source](http://daysailer1.com/2009/06/11/colorado-toy-vehicle-law/)\).

The fact that current regulations say that stand up motoroized scooters are not legal on sidewalks or public streets is no doubt why the city government is having a hard time responding uniformly to the arrival of these scoots.

Hopefully we get some clarification on motorized scooters soon. But until then, it is clear from the State's materials that Lime / Bird / etc motorized scooters are not "low power scooters", but "toy vehicles". And therefore the regulations in your post .

If your post is not about Lime, please ignore me  and enjoy your Vespa :\). [deleted] I'm down! We could start with a meetup or two, gather some interest, and look into more regularity/formality.  It has nothing to do with electric kick scooters; this is about low power scooters (50 cc). It's an annual post I make every May.  I've written about toy vehicles before Lime was a thing here. I'm well aware of the distinction. http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/6jbu03/kick_scooter_laws_in_denver/djdksnd

> By law, your kick scooter would be considered a [toy vehicle](https://library.municode.com/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTIINGE_S54-1DE), which [cannot enter the roadway](https://library.municode.com/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=REMUCOCODECO_CH54TRRE_ARTIIIENTRRURE_S54-59USCOROATSKSIDEREYIRI-WPE) except to cross the street at a crosswalk. 

> "Toy vehicle shall mean any vehicle that has wheels and is not designed for use on public highways or for off-road use. Toy vehicle includes, but is not limited to, gas-powered or electric-powered vehicles commonly known as minibikes, 'pocket bikes,' kamikaze boards, go-peds, and stand-up scooters."

> Regarding bike trails (e.g., cherry creek trail), your toy vehicle would be prohibited by [park rules 16 and 17](https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/747/documents/rules/DPR_ParkUse_RulesRegulations_05272015.pdf).  Sorry, but [this is Denver Man.](https://media.giphy.com/media/F7Udgq0h3S8iA/giphy.gif) I was thinking about doing a meet up as well.  I didnt know if it would get the word out or not though. Fair enough. Given the massive amount of scooter posts in the past week, I thought it worth mentioning that Lime do not fall under the same regulations. I do appreciate you raising the issue and making the distinction. I should've thought about all the Lime posts and clarified. I wouldn't want people to be confused and think this post applies to kick scooters and other toys. Thanks.  Yep \-\- that's all I was trying to do. Realize my wording was a bit agressive. Distinction just seemed important given the last week of regular Lime posts. Not all scoots are created equal. 

I'd love to see kick scooters elevated from the realm of "toy" to a more "serious" form of transit to solve the last mile problem. But the current regulations are what they are.  I edited my post to add the clarification and gave you credit for raising the issue. 

I agree that they need to change the law for kick scooters. Nobody wants people riding those things on the sidewalk. Personally, I'd rather see them in bike lanes; I don't think they'd be in the way or interfere with people on bicycles.
