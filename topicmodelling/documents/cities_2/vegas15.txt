Any one know of any jobs for a disabled person? Hey all!

I'm currently in a wheelchair (hopefully temporarily) and it's gonna be at least a couple months before I can walk again. Is there a center or some place I can go to see what kind or jobs I can get?  Voc-Rehab located in the Job Connect offices should be able to help.  Opportunity Village may have an employment program also although I'm not sure.  I worked at Catholic Charities at one time, and a coworker was in a wheelchair.  You can pretty much do any office job; it's just finding the right employer. Do you have any skills? Besides Craigslist there's [this](http://www.nevadajobconnect.com/). I worked as a receptionist for 2 years, setting up appts, answering phones, invoicing. I was a cashier for a while..that's pretty much it. I'm currently in CSN part time.
