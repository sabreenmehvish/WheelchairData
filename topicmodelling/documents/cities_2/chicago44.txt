Overdose or Fatality on Blue Line at Clark/Lake Does anyone know what happened? My girl friend said she saw a woman being carried up in a wheelchair with her eyes rolled into the back of her head and skin looking blue...anyone have an idea if she is alright? Could be heat stroke. Demonic possession. Goddamn demons!
