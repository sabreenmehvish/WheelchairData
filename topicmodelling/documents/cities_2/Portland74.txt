/r/portland Thanksgiving details and RSVP form! **EDIT:  Bring a musical instruments!  Unamplified is best, but small amps are OK!**

**EDIT #2:  Football in the park across the street, board games TBD...**

Hey folks, 

Here's the [signup link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PY2-bj8ukFygCv4WQbr7jy7FRL9aKsJ3UGjCNpzyNPM/viewform)!

[/u/coolhandmarie](http://www.reddit.com/user/coolhandmarie) and I combined forces last year and had a BLAST doing a Thanksgiving with Redditors.

We're hosting again this year, but instead of my house, I'm opening up the factory floor at [ADX](http://www.adxportland.com) from 1pm to 9pm (possibly later) to folks this time so we have enough space.  This is *NOT* an "official" ADX event, so please contact us via Reddit or email (in the signup form) with questions.

Due to fire hazard stuff, we do need to cap attendance - we had about 30 last year over the course of the final day, and we're (verifying soon) going to be able to handle about 50-60 at a time right now.  Please RSVP only if you're fairly certain you can come!

Kids welcome, we are wheelchair accessible (including railing in the bathroom).

Also, in addition to food, we'll need:

* Decorations - anyone crafty out there?
* Booze, for those of you who suck at cooking and are feeling generous!
* Chairs!  We'll probably need like 30... any help?

Thanks as always to the mods (especially for the sidebar listing!) and again to Thanksgiving cofounder /u/coolhandmarie for her initial post, and look forward to having y'all again! Once again, I'm extremely excited. I'm a great cook, but have no cooking space, BUT I'm also a bartender, so I will booze y'all up and down and sideways with my favorites. I doubt spanish coffees will be practical, but Buffalo sours and what not might be fun. Aww yeah adx! I will PM everyone who responded. Bam! I won't RSVP because we are 50/50 - 2 adults and 2 kids (4years and 6 weeks). I can bring dessert or actual food. My cooking skills are sleep dependent so they are also 50/50 ;) Oh gosh! If we are not doing anything, I will be sure to get in on this! How late can we sign up for? Whenever the cap is met, I'm assuming... This is so generous and awesome. If I didn't have to hang with my own family, I'd be psyched to make you guys my family for the day. If it hasn't filled up tomorrow, I will sign up. Are you going to contact people who have filled out the RVSP? I'm willing to come help set up, prep food and supply some liquor and beer. I would be willing to bring my acoustic guitar, however, I will be travelling by Trimet. It wouldn't let me put down zero guests, soooo I put 1.  "put zero if just yourself" but form doesn't accept 0. I put 1 in instead, but please be aware of this. I'm in! I can bring booze and some sort of food that I don't need to cook. Remember I have a free turkey to donate but I can't cook it at home (lazy no time too much effort lolz) What time do you think most people will come to eat? I'm just trying to figure out when I should make sure I am off of work by! It's awesome that you are doing this again! I will likely not be there this time, as I have an invitation to join someone else. But if that falls through, I may drop in. Hey, I sent in my RSVP last week for bringing booze and possibly dessert. I was thinking wine and apple pie, anyone have any opposition to this? I'm not terribly active (read: not at all) on this sub but I'm going to see if I can make it out for part of this before I go home to spend time drunk on google hangout with my far-flung also family-free friends. I'll confirm if I can and sign up by this weekend. This is an awesome thing! Signed up +1 and looking forward to it! This is gonna be awesome!  Let me know if you have issues with the [RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PY2-bj8ukFygCv4WQbr7jy7FRL9aKsJ3UGjCNpzyNPM/viewform) form or just post any questions! I'm committing to coming but sorta so-so on food since I don't want anyone to eat a baked mouse. If I can't get them out before Thanksgiving I fear they'll be living in the oven in 2 weeks time :( This is awesome! I'm new to Portland and know next to nobody here. I RSVPD to bring dessert. I'm a vegetarian too so I'm thinking I could also bring Tofurkey. Are there any other vegetarians planning to attend? I'm going for sure and my roomie might join. I'm going to see if my mom will send me key limes from Florida so I can make some key lime pies for everyone! 
Are there any other dishes I should bring that no one else is bringing?
 Still have room for one more orphan? [deleted] Feed me whiskey sours please. Sweet!  Are you OLCC certified?  That might be a huge (needed) bonus! Thanks for the shoutout!  You coming? Perfect, thanks!  Keeps making me wait because of spam filters to reply to everyone, waaaay better!  WOO! So RSVP at 2 people, that way it averages out.  Trust me, it would be helpful for us  :) Glad to see someone else with a youngin! Not certain either, but I have a 3 year old and it's out first thanksgiving since moving here and we have no close friends or any family out here yet.  Just sign up now!  I'm assuming 50% of people won't show :) ...come later, drunk! Sign up you lovely bastard.  Not full! Did you sign up? Yeah, I'm going to do an email or two confirming/reminding folks and coordinating details with /u/coolhandmarie! Fixed, thank you! Fixed, thanks! Sweeeet!  See you there. Welcome to come early and claim the oven!  It's a regular sized electric range; I'll be there around 11 to begin setup, come early? I am still down to pick it up, cook it, and bring it to the party with a little sign saying it is from you Sad news, may not have turkey. Company isn't doing so well this year heard rumors they aren't donating us turkeys :(((((((((((((
~~I might show up early w/ a chicken instead and roast my thang.~~

EDIT: ~~F-that, I make Arctic Roll instead.~~

EDIT2: Double F-that, I bought SinDawgs from Dave's Killer bread. Probably about 2-4pm?  Starts at 1, we'll likely still be setting up/cooking until about 2 or 3! Hope you stop by! I am stridently in favor of both wine and apple pie. What barbarian would object to pie? :-D  I demand Pecan Pumpkin Pie ! Just sign up!  We'll be confirming people via email and removing anyone; bigger is better for our headcount, since folks will show we don't account for. woo! ...I have no idea what's going on.  But glad you're coming! Can confirm. Am vegan. I will TRY to have a clean kitchen for stuffing making from scratch. If not I'll be hitting Sweat Pea or New Seasons for pre-made pie. ALSO last year I saw local vegans had one of those turkey shapped veg-turkeys that apparently Food Fight in the vegan mini-mall carries. I really want one, in general, so I might try to seek it out but I tend to dislike too much mock meat so my harvest roast loaf thing went bad on me in the fridge before I could eat it all. If you bring a tofurkey I'll eat a slice. (FYI I find basting it several times and doing the tinfoil wrap roast thing with root veggies to make the best tofurkey product)

ALSO and I've never been but there's a meetup group for local Portland Metro Vegans. I'm sure you probably join and just leave your dairy/eggs at home :) /u/duckduck_goose is vegan and is coming! No idea; but folks have signed up to bring veggie dishs.   A tofurkey would be appreciated by many, I suspect!

And welcome to town!  Our space tends to attract newcomers to town, so you'll be in good company. I have no idea!  It's a potluck! :)  That sounds amazing! Absolutely!  Many more! Will do, thanks!  Looking forward to it. You want me to just stand there and... Pour it all in your mouth? Of course. I'm one of the bartenders at the Doug fir. Yup yup! And by 'of course' I mean uuuhh huh! Bartender here olcc certified and willing to assist.  Food handlers card also I'll rsvp tomorrow I believe I will skip anyone I can see you already responded to! Ok! I just didn't want to put it over the people count if we don't make it Reallyz? That's hard to predict head count. How you know how much food to prep? Yes I did; thank you for asking. I'm the one with the lochmon.com email address. (Never did get around to building my website, alas.)

I didn't select any particular type of food to bring, because I guessed there would be some gaps in coverage. Give me a call or email if there's something specific needed. Otherwise I'll just bring beer. Haha alright I'll PM you once I pick it up I will purchase turkey for the party if it comes down to it, we will be glad to meet you anyway! Ok, perfect! Really looking forward to it!

 Ok, sounds good! [Sometimes I forget there isn't a video camera filming my life for all of Portland/reddit/the internet to see](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1qqf0m/update_a_ladys_only_meetup/)

Do you still make cutting boards? I might need a cutting board custom made for a 1900s built in if you do and won't charge me West Elm prices for it. I mentioned in the last thread that I want to come, and would almost definitely bring a tofurkey. I don't know if I can say with certainty until it gets closer though, and by then it might be too late to RSVP. I registered.  Do I just show up or is there something else I should do? Yes and I'm a fun drunk. Sweet!  Your branding person works offsite here sometimes! Excellent!  Not sure we need it, but I'm not risking anything with the OLCC.   Bartender #2 - thanks! Great! Sweet!  May have a bartender, too! No worries!  We assume about 1/3 to 1/2 won't actually come... We're not prepping food; it's a potluck!   I suspect everyone will get leftovers, given prior examples.

In terms of head count, very hard to predict - but I have 10 years of event recruitment/planning/etc behind me from a prior life in grassroots organizing, so I can usually make a pretty good estimate based on # of signups and confirmations :)



 I'll fix you up if you come, but I'm not quite able to find the time myself these days! It finally all makes sense. Just RSVP!  We'll be confirming and want a rough head count - better to over than underestimate on our end! Just come!  Bring stuff! I'll find my funnel. which one? Got anymore table saws I can take off your hands? Whoa, we are stickied now! This is gonna be so much fun Nope, but if you don't want to take your hands off with a table saw, feel free to come by and take a class :) Lemme fix your sound system first Oh my, please!  Who is this?! You'll find out You could ask your shop hand if you're working tonight Figured it out even without the hint!

Hey, we're running [Gifted](http://www.adxportland.com/gifted-2013/) again this year if you all want to sell your stuff, or if you want to... uh, "demo" it Thanksgiving that might be cool too... our speakers are 100% blown! I'll forward that to my boss for sure. Maybe when i'm there for thanksukkah i'll take a look at your gear
