PM me or Reply via my craigslist posts if interested! Greetings Tucsonans. :)  Anyone have a wheelchair I can borrow for 2-3 weeks? I just had knee surgery. I also have amazing homemade Minnesota jam for trade

I just had an arthroscopic meniscus repair last Thursday. I didn't realize just how much of a nuisance it would be having to get around on crutches. I can't carry anything without it being in a backpack, and I can't pick anything up while I'm standing up! I could be on crutches for up to another 3 weeks. I won't die if I just have crutches, but having a wheelchair would open up a lot of doors for me. It would make it way easier for me to get to school, walk my dog, do laundry, and grocery shop.

I'm a college student on a shoestring budget so I don't have much money. But I do have some delicious jam from my mom's and my garden up in Minnesota. I went back over the summer and we made all kinds of tasty jams. All I have left is red raspberry. It's super duper good, like, you have no idea. You can't buy raspberries like this in the store. I picked them myself, perfectly ripe, and turned them into jam within a couple hours. Also, this is freezer jam, which means the fruit hasn't been cooked, and the flavor is perfectly preserved. It tastes like you just picked it. There's enough sugar in the jam to keep it good for a while, but you do have to eat it within about a month of thawing to be on the safe side. It'll stay good in the freezer for years though.

I don't need the wheelchair forever either. I would give it back to you when I'm done with it. I'm at Pima and Swan, and would require you to drop it off, because I can't ride my bike like this! But I'll be able to bring it back to you when I'm done if you're within 10 miles or so, or meet you up to 10 miles away from me if you live further than that. Thanks for reading!
