Stolen Motorized Wheelchair near SAP Center? I was driving down Julian St toward Stockton Ave and as I went under the CalTrain tracks, a guy was pushing a motorized wheelchair against traffic, in the road, and up the hill.  I pulled over and ran back and offered him help, but by the time I got there, he made it up the hill and said he didn't need any help, and he was taking a break and smoking a cigarette.  He didn't seem like the type to have a wheelchair, as he had on work boots and looked spry.  He was probably late 40's, caucasian, tan, tall, and had a strong build.  

I wouldn't expect someone to drive their wheelchair so far beyond its range like that, especially since I then saw him up at St. James and Market when I passed him on my way back home.  

Not sure how much help this would be if that guy did in fact steal someone's wheelchair, but at least I pointed you in the direction he was heading?
