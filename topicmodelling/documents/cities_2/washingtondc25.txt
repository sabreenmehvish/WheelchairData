Bystanders rescue man in wheelchair after seeing him fall onto metro tracks (via DCist)  Worth noting for future good samaritans: they say the third rail was the real danger here, not the train a few stops away. Pretty terrifying I hope I could make the correct decision here.  These are some brave people.  umbrella guy was too busy for life And, while not super relevant here, remember that if ever a train is bearing down on someone in this situation, there is space under the edge of the platform to press up against the wall in case you can't get off the tracks in time. If you squeeze completely under the platform edge overhang, you're out of the train's path. Yes and a further note: at each end of the platform, on both sides, is a button that de-energizes the third rail. It's contained in a grey call box under a blue light. This is absolutely an appropriate use for it. 

Bear in mind this won't make an approaching train come to a halt. It turns off the power only within the platform limits. The train will continue to coast even when the power is off.  **Was curious so I confirmed the emergency third rail stop bottom on the WMATA website [\[Source\]](http://www.wmata.com/getting_around/safety_security/bus_rail.cfm):**  

>Emergency call boxes are located at the far end of station platforms and every 800 feet along the tracks. Marked by blue lights, these boxes provide a hotline into Central Control and a button for bringing down third-rail power in extreme emergencies.

> On the tracks Falls from the platform to the trackbed are rare, but if you find yourself there, don’t panic and remember these lifesaving rules:   
■ If you fall when a train is entering the station, roll beneath the platform edge away from the train and power rail. There is a safety area underneath the platform edge where you will be safe.   
■ Call out for help but do not touch any part of the train or the track.    
■ Stay there until help arrives. Wait for instructions from a Metro employee.     Do not try to climb onto the platform without assistance from a Metro employee. > at each end of the platform, on both sides, is a button that de-energizes the third rail.

TIL. Thanks for the tip! Is this down on the tracks or at regular platform level?  Kinda hope I get to do that some day.

Do you work for metro? At the platform level, typically just on the other side of the gate at the end of the platform. I'm fairly certain he's stated that he does in the past.
