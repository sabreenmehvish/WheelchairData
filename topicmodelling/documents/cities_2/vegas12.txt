 The Alpaca thing sounds like a hot ticket.  Wouldn't mind attending. > HUMMINGHERD'S XXXTRAORDINAIRE

This sounds more like a drug sale than an animal sale. Hey last year i met a nice lady from parhump who sells alpacas and bought a Australian Sheppard from her.  Where? For..science Would be funny if r/vegas legit showed up for the alpaca event and had a killer time. We could make it an annual thing. The r/vegas Alpaca Sale Meet-up  Like all around. I'll be posting on twitter!!  [deleted] I'm down. Sounds like a fun way to kill time this weekend. Handle? :P or PM me if you don't want it floating around The opening to Macklemore's Thrift Shop is playing in my head watching that on loop. It's the same as my username here @suzistaxxx
