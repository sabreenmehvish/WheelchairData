Regular day in Los Angeles  Making my way downtown This is Francine Dancer: https://www.laweekly.com/news/dancing-queen-2142966

Really, she makes the best out of a rough situation. She shows up to some underground/art events from time to time as well. She use to have a public access show. Damn I just got flashbacks when cable only had less than 100 channels  Idk her story but i respect her for walking as much as her body will allow with the assistance of those stripper heels and all. Its easy to just let go of yourself once you're in a wheelchair but she's owning it. Lol lmao that lady, i work at a nonprofit and she came in for food bank and she left her underwear in a bag that she gave us to fill up with food. my boss and  I looked into it and just started laughing. [Original thread](https://redd.it/8yg97v) by u/18spuln Vermont near Santa Monica. I remember that lady when she could walk. Some tits on her. Holy shit. I just regaled my friends with a story of seeing her at Cafe NELA tending to her mannequin that she put up on stage and how she crawled out of her wheelchair and started dancing and crawling over the speakers. It was so bizarre. Itâ€™s called fashion sweetie.  Haha I would love to see this clip set to that song.  Her legs work just fine. She gets up and dances for an hour at time when she wants to.
