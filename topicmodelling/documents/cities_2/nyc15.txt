Man, I gotta start using uber...  improvement surcharge sounds like a massive rip off Dude I Coulda sold you my Toyota Tercel from 2001 for $400. Man, Uber's just a fraction of [that!](http://gothamist.com/2015/04/21/uber_12k_ride.php) yeah rush hour blows Choose cash.. >surcharge

>extra

Now I'm out of the loop here but I'm pretty sure I know what surcharge means. That surcharge goes to the wheelchair accessible program. It's bull but that's what it's for. Don't know what's the state/fuel surcharge, never seen that before. There's also supposed to be a MTA surcharge of $0.50 that subsidizes the MTA. Still available..? Cream puff. Rides like a dream. Mechanic's special. Brand new wipers. Save $$$ on gas.  haha missed that one.  Can't with an Uber I thought that went to their health benefits? My uncle owns a cab, explained all to me. They don't get any health benefits whatsoever. They'd have to buy their own health insurance. There's always 2 surcharges to a cab; 50 cents for MTA, 30 cents for wheelchair accessibility. 

Every 3 months, he pays the state the MTA surcharge he collected. Then he'd have to go to TLC's lars [website](https://www1.nyc.gov/lars/), and pay the 30 cent surcharges he collected. 

The TLC explained to them that that 30 cent surcharge is to implement the system for disabled people to call in for a cab, or order one online. Some of it goes to certain owners who have installed one of those wheelchair lifts. The wheelchair lift along with the Nissan NV-200 costs about $55,000 all fixed up. Apparently the owners will get reimbursed over time (4 years) of about 30-40K from TLC. That's what the 30 cent surcharge is for.
 And never mind then! Thanks for correcting me, I thought it was for benefits. Why the hell am I paying for Wheelchair accessibility? I don't have a wheelchair... why don't they make people in wheelchairs pay for my physical therapy. Absolute rubbish. [deleted] Health insurance I am paying for, that's the whole point of insurance, you pay to offset future risk. But that is a CHOICE I made. If you need a special vehicle you should pay the cost not everyone else. You could use emotional drivel for almost any circumstance imaginable as a justification for taking money out of my wallet to pay for other peoples problems.
