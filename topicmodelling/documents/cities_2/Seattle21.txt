Blinking light on wheelchair causes delay of Mariners game (poor guy...)  It sucks when this is the most interesting thing about a mariners game in late August Why? What's the big deal? I'll be honest; I got a craving for Jimmy John's and drove into Sodo to buy a sandwich at around 6:30 tonight. The whole time I was thinking *"Man, I'm glad the Mariners aren't more popular or this might be a nightmare."*

**EDIT:** Christ, just imagine I said "some food" instead. It's a distraction to the hitters. Jimmy Johns founder uses his profits to hunt endangered animals and is a financial supporter of Sheriff Joe Arpaio.   http://www.bilerico.com/2012/05/more_than_one_reason_not_to_eat_at_jimmy_johns.php  None of these facts make the sandwich I ate last night any less delicious. No,but it does make you financial supporter of a racist sheriff and it does make you a financier in the slaughter of endangered animals.   I wonder if that's a write-off? Kinda like you? NO NO NO YOU ARE. YOU ARE, MAN. YOU. You seem kinda proud to support Arpaio and the killing of endangered animals.  Makes you the opposite of me. No, I really just don't give a shit about any of this and don't care to continue this Sandwich Shoppe Argument you've engendered. I think that you do.
