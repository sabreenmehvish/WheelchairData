I guess I only have one question.  Nothing to see here, just modern art. Maybe it's the bicycle-equivalent of a sidecar? that's like, 5 more wheels than you actually need! The larger question is who is this person who wheelchairs over and walks inside?  A wheelchair thief could be through that cable in seconds. Chain is off on the bike. so, are you handicapped, or not?  The bike and wheelchair are not attached to each other, just locked to the same stand. I thought that was the question. But it's not a bad idea... Especially if the sidecar rider has strong enough arms to take over drivetrain duty.
