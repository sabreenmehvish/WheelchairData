Wheelchair accessible majestic views? Neighbor hurt her knee pretty bad skiing, shes chairbound for the forseeable future and asked if I knew of any nice views; I'm familiar with the 2 freeway goin into the mountains but L.A. is so spread out and dense, was curious if any Angelenos would be willing to share any chill vistas they frequent.

Lots of cool kites at the park too.
