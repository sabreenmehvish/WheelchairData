Some kind of wheelchair protest in Chinatownâ€”what are they chanting?  I saw them going down 15th St. past the White House yesterday evening around 7:15pm.  I'd like to know what this was too.   I saw those guys on Sunday, they were the worst chanters ever.     I eventually deciphered it as "Down with nursing homes", but it sounds like they have a new one now.
