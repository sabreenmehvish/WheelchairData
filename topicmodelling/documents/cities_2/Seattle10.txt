Hey Seattle, we're on a roadtrip across the country and will be in your city for the next few days. Let me know if there's anything we can help you with My friend and I are driving across the country and doing whatever [missions/things/tasks/stuff](http://internetadventureclub.com/) people send us (even if its something small like helping you move a couch). So let us know if you have an adventure to share with us or want to use us as free manual labor.

We'll be getting in on Monday afternoon and staying till Wednesday/Thursday. We are up for anything.

Things I can definitely do include: manual labor, driving, and bartending. Let me know if there's anything I can do for you.

[TLDR: Give me things to do and I'll do them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P07c3s4V-uY) bring rain If you get exhausted after doing everyone's work for them and you find yourself north of the city near Lynnwood please stop by for some tea. Our living room is set up like a Chinese tea tasting house and if you're into tea at all you'll be in for a treat. Even if you're not, we have some really amazing tea here. Either way enjoy your time in Seattle! I broke my leg so I'm going to have to remember this. This is a cool thing you're doing. I don't really have a mission for you, but I just wanted to say hey and let you know that I think you're a great person.  I met you last time you were here and I'm happy to see that you're taking this adventure thing somewhere!

I don't know if you remember me or my story about my Dad, but he is doing so much better now.  He has his heath issues under control (as much as he can, given he has an aneurism and all), is in a much better place mentally, and is even doing a half marathon in about a month! 

Good luck with your travels!   

Link /u/Generique's original post (I'm the top comment, which was completely unexpected): https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/  I gave you guys my info on your site if you need a place to crash. Also you're welcome to come visit me at my school Ada Developers Academy. It's a great place.  Hey Daniel | Benson | Chris,

Huge Fan! I submitted my idea, but then I realized how lame my idea was/sounded (6-pack on roof). 

Whether you hit me up or not, you need to hit up the library (Benson can edit in peace) cause it's cool as hell! The Market | Pier area. And finally, but most importantly hit up [Paseo](http://www.paseoseattle.com/). My coworkers from London come here just for that. Don't miss it. 

Also, you should walk down the street and ask everyone where they work and why it's Amazon.

Love the show, keep it up! I actually have an in-work shelving project that could really use some help right now (because I have no idea what I'm doing)!  Regardless of how much I want to be open to inviting strangers like you guys over to help out and potentially even give you a place to crash ... the thought still makes me feel moderately uncomfortable.  Hopefully on your next pass-through I'll be over that, because I've got a lifetime of projects on the docket.  :D  Cheers, and yes- bring rain, plz.   Come by Miller Community Center Tuesday 6-8:30 and try some wheelchair basketball with the Wheelchair Sonics!! Welcome back!  Hey, thanks again for the help with the couch last time you were in town.

Let me know if you need anything while you're here, I'm down to buy you guys a beer. Go see/hear the jazz jam session @ 10pm - Owl 'N Thistle. Go down to Tacoma (45 minutes at most), buy some weed (or bring your own), and get high at Pt. Defiance Park. One of the biggest city parks in the nation, beautiful 270 degree views of the Puget Sound/Narrows Bridge, miles of hiking trails, and even a zoo. While it may not have as much to do or be as famous as Seattle, Tacoma is a much easier city to enjoy.
 Watch the news in a week for the stories of serial murders. It's too hot to help you. Go away until it cools down. Ok, next? Can I visit
? This sounds awesome. I love tea! But we're headed south after Seattle :(

Sounds like you might be throwing a reddit tea party though which should be fun! My pleasure, I hope you never had to move the couch back down! OP delivered! Please do! :-) You can PM me for details. It's only 15 minutes north of th city. :-) This sounds lovely!  Sure, stop by! :-)
