The YWCA is doing a fundraiser on top of the new downtown Maverik HQ where people can rappel all the way down the side of the building  Think they'll let me do it in my wheelchair? Haven't been rapping in a while ;) you got movement in your arms? I bet they could strap you in if you could get yourself down Oh I got *ALL* the movement in my arms :)    
I'm lucky.  i bet you could bilet (i know that can't be the spelling) You could be our reddit sponsored guest! I think it's $1000 bucks to do it. I'd throw in $10 to see someone go off the side of the building! Hahaha it's "belay".   

And I'm not sure I'd want to spend my entire savings on something like that, no matter how cool it would be. 

[This is probably one of the coolest raps I've done. Before the wheelchair though haha. Can you spot me?](http://i.imgur.com/5eXFHKs.jpg) can I ask how you ended up in the wheelchair? was it climbing related? Took a while on mobile -red shirt huh Nah it was a surfing accident.  damn. well, you are probably still more athletic than me and I have full use of these sad things I call legs
