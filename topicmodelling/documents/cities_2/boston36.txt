Anyone have an old wheelchair they no longer need? A friend of mine from the Boston area is looking for a wheelchair for a family friend who is going through some tough times and also needs some medical equipment. Since my resources for the area are limited (I'm in NY) I figured this would be a good place to ask so if anyone has an unused wheelchair they don't mind parting with as cheap as possible I would be more than appreciative for it. Also open to suggestions if you know somewhere to find such a thing. Thanks!  When I was younger, I remember my dad donating a bunch of old durable medical equipment to the Masonic Temple around here. I think they still run this program, have your friend check them out.

Good Luck

 You may also want to try Boston Craigs List for free/cheap wheelchairs. Good luck I Have wheelchair you could take, free of charge. Only thing is I live an hour away from Boston. So if your friend does not mind picking it up its all yours. I might be able to bring it to them sometime over the weekend though if that is to much of a hassle. Thank you all for your help, kindess and suggestions! u/Scientific_Railgun graciously provided one but I really appreciate everything you guys suggestion. You rule!  For free: baby wheelchair, never used.  I can vouch for the mason's program because I've gotten a few wheelchairs and walkers for elderly neighbors there. They have a lot of durable medical equipment for free. All they ask is that you return it when done.

 AWESOME - I will definitely shoot this link over to them. Thanks so much! Thanks - I will relay this to them but I believe they checked with their local churches and thrifts.  I believe they have with no luck but I will doublecheck myself as well. Thanks for the suggestion :) Oh no, I absolutely wouldnt want you to lift a finger for it. Could you PM me your details and I will forward it to them? I appreciate it so much!  Thanks - I believe the recipient is ~125lbs though so I dont think that would work, right? I really appreciate it though! [deleted] Sure! and no problem.  It was Hemmingway's! Close on the names. And I do believe that's what diplomaticschematic was referencing.
