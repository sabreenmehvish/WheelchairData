San Francisco cops could get Tasers. Is it good or a 'Don't tase me bro' situation?  Almost every time they have shot and killed someone in the last few years, it could have been entirely prevented with a taser.  They have usually been standoffs with people who have knives or some other weapon that isn't a gun.  Did you see the video of the guy in a wheelchair with a knife that they shot?  He did throw the knife, but it wasn't like he was crocodile dundee.  They could have tased him and been done with it pretty fast. It all depends on department use/monitoring policy. 

I'm all for having less-lethal options available, so long as they aren't used as simple coercion/compliance tools.  I was all for it when the PD brought it up a while back (last year, I think), but the idea faced opposition because tasers can still be fatal. While we patiently waited for a better alternative, several subjects were needlessly shot and killed and officers injured. Not sure what kind of logic the opposition was using. Perhaps they thought all cops can easily disarm a person with their hands and feet like Jackie Chan, so there's no need for a weapon I guess.  >Did you see the video of the guy in a wheelchair with a knife that they shot?

This is the first thing I thought of. In spite of all of the unjustified tazings we here about from time to time in the news, there absolutely is a definite niche for a tazer.

Used properly, I believe it can definitely save lives or, at least, reduce harm. This video: http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/crime/2011/01/video-san-francisco-police-shooting-man-wheelchair
