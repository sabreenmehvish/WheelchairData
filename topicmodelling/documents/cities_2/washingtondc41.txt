Metro Cops Take Down a Man in a Wheelchair.  I'm not really sure of anything he could do that would warrant a takedown like that. Seems like they could have just held on firmly to the handles of his wheelchair to prevent him from fleeing the scene... My neck hurts from watching this. Metro Transit PD have launched an investigation. Officers remain on with pay.
