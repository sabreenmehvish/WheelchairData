Hey folks, keep an eye out for this girls wheelchair in NoPo and St John's. Fell out of a truck.  Fell off a truck as in, "Hey Paulie, check out these new Louis Vuittons, they fell off a truck in Newark."

Or like, just fell off a truck?  No I don't have a case number. I really hope it turns up. Wheelchairs are expensive and insurance may not cover a second one...if they even covered the first.  How about the brother in law buys a new one?  Who leaves the tailgate down on their pickup while driving down the road with something in the bed? Probably already scrapped for parts by the hobos. While I do hope it gets returned I wouldn't get my hopes up. I see more baby strollers being used for moving junk instead of babies these days.  Anyone else misread the title and think that the girl was in the wheelchair when it fell off gut truck then went missing?  ur banned I've seen a lot of trucks with the tailgate removed altogether.  From what I understand they think it improves gas mileage, Mythbusters proved that one wrong.  For the little hoboglit children.  Eh, having been through this before, I've been told they're pretty hard to scrap. Most chairs are basically one piece of metal.
