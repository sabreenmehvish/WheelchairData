I need a Lil help. I am trying to locate a wheelchair to rent for 24 hours. 

My niece is graduating  high school on Thursday and her mom just had a pretty horrifying and invasive surgery. After a 2 week hospital stay, they sent her home with a wound vac, Dilaudid,  and basically said she doesn't need a wheel chair. 

Ugh. I'm scared the place they are holding graduation is going to seat us too far for her to walk comfortabley and also afraid that someone might knock into her without some sort of visual "hey wheel chair, I'm injured"

I have tried calling a lot of the local medical equipment rental places and they want a min. 2 week rental and quite a few need the insurance companies info.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
I can pick up on Wednesday evening or  Thursday morning and return it on Friday morning or whenever is convenient for you.

 I rented a wheelchair from Buford Road Pharmacy for a few days for something very reasonable (under $25) but that was a few years ago.  Have also rented out of town in similar places--check the non-chain drug stores (Westhampton or Westbury, something like that).  Good luck! My friend/roommate has one he no longer uses. I can ask for you when he wakes up. For the Love of Jesus thrift and Good Samaritan are thrift stores on south side that seem to always have medical supplies like this. I know buying one might not be the best option, but if it comes down to it you should check with these places.  I rented one from Westbury Pharmacy but I heard they closed down.
