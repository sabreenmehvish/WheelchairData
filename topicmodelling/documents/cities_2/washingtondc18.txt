Man in a Wheelchair Dies of Apparent Hypothermia in Columbia Heights  Friendly reminder that the hypothermia hotline went active November 1st. You can call them 24 hours a day at 202-399-7093 and report a homeless person that appears to be in need of shelter. We need to keep an eye out for our most vulnerable residents as winter approaches. So sad to hear. There are many sick people in that area and it seemed inevitable something like this would happen. Homelessness is such a big problem in our city and our country and it depresses me that we have people dying on the streets.  > Currinder says she asked a man and a separate group of women nearby for help, as she had forgotten her cell phone at home. They demurred, so she hurried back to her house and dialed 911.

What?! This is just start of this.  Off topic, anyone know the name of the old homeless man on a wheelchair with a chessboard? I've seen him mostly in the Chinatown/Metro Center area. Always break my heart.  What a country  Yes it has.   [deleted] Hypothermia can begin when it's 50F outside or even 70F degree water. Let alone the variance for someone who is in poor health.
