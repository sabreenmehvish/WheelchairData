SLC PD ask for help finding stolen van; vehicle is modified for wheelchair use and had man's medication inside  This story struck home for me, as my brother-in-law relied on a van just like this for several years before he died due to ALS. Families in that situation rely so heavily on these vans, and the modification is expensive, so if you see the van please call SLC PD at 801-799-3000.

His clothes, medical equipment and medication are inside. On top of that, his parents used their retirement funds to buy the van. Police say the couple are a retired firefighter and nurse.
