Cops knock over a lady in a wheelchair while towing a car from 33rd and Seward. Good job, OPD.   He's guilty, that's plain as day--watch the video, the perp is publicly being black in a low-income neighborhood. Here is the link to the actual youtube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txwx5HXMbfQ&feature=youtu.be

Any thoughts fellow Omahans? Strange, last night someone had posted the original youtube video on the Omaha sub reddit.  Now it's not there.  It was posted prior to the news broadcast and included good conversations.  One person even included a link to another incidence of police controlling the situation for their own safety.  
I would like to see the actions of both parties leading up to the take down. I think /r/omaha already decided that they think there was no excessive force.  I wonder if the news of the police knocking over a woman in a wheelchair will change their opinions. I broke it down on the other thread but I'll do it again if it will help. 

- You start with a man in the street clearly disobeying officers, the situation has already escalated to the point where a female officer feels the need to draw her Taser, which indicates that the original suspect has been acting in a way that is likely to result in an arrest. 
- An officer directs him to put his hands on the truck to place him in handcuffs and the suspect throws out an arm to push himself off of the truck and resist the officer's movements. At this point the officer needs to effect the arrest and cannot do so without the upper-hand, so the officer utilizes a standard technique to get the suspect on the ground. 
- Once on the ground, the suspect likely (based on past actions, the suspect's upper body action and level of resistance are no longer clear.) continued to resist the arrest and the two officers placing him in cuffs used pain compliance (closed fist strikes) to apply the handcuffs you can see the female officer pull out at about 22 sec. 
- One of the officers request backup on his shoulder mic. 
- A third officer puts a bystander in an arm-bar hold to remove them from the area, and releases them to the sidewalk once they are clear of the officers on the ground. That individual is not in any way prevented from filming but continues to pace around the officer. The officer follows him to his steps and then backs off again. The man comes back down claiming he will stay on the sidewalk and then shortly after leaves the sidewalk and steps into the street. 
- The third officer, having continually pushed this man back, runs after him to place him under arrest and the individual runs into a house which the officer enters shortly after. Other arriving officers run to the house, not knowing the extent of the problem, officers continue to arrive for the remainder of the video. The female officer runs in the house to assist as well. 
- While on the ground, the original suspect continues to resist the officer while handcuffed, the officer strikes the suspect several more times. (not clearly justifiable). 
-The officers finally bring the second suspect out of the house and place him in a cruiser, while placing him in the car, crude language is used by the officers and the suspect. (while a bit unprofessional, its not by any means excessive force). [Here's more footage from the incident.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wRg2tqwMMU) It's still there, just downvoted to hell.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/1as0c2/omaha_police_using_excessive_force_this_is/
 Note that GameDrain, if you view his history far back enough, pretty much jumps to the defense of the police any chance he gets, and pretty much admits it in one post.  You'll interpret and color the events to the police's favor, every time.  

I can invent a different scenario with as much "indicates" and "likely"s as you had too, but I don't have the time.  The takedown, however, was clearly more than the situation warranted as the man was not being violent.  We can also see from the arrest of the bystander calling out this abuse (this is how I choose to spin the events) and the cop's swift reaction to someone vocally announcing the abuse (look at how many cop cars there are?  Since when does OPD even ever respond in a timely manner) and the VERY angry and dominating, insulting language to the young man he arrested, we see that this was primarily an aggressive,, angry, backlash sort of thing, much in the way cops will harass people videotaping arrests (which I'm sure you defend too). 4 people were fired. Guess you aren't the go to guy for breakdowns.  and if you look at your history we see nothing but divisive posts that kill off respectful dialogue. I defend police action quite a bit because Reddit has an anti-police bent to it. But I never defend actions that don't have a justifiable side to them. I just try to remind Reddit that there are two sides to every story, and that police are people too. I have it on good information that the officers were fired for conduct that occurred off-camera within the house (with the exception of the officer punching the handcuffed man, which as I stated was not clearly justified) There are far more than two sides to every story. Finding the one that isn't biased is the real point. I wouldn't consider yours to be unbiased whatsoever. I am able to see your point of view but the escalation is quite questionable from a "team people" prospective.  All I ask is that you see the two sides, I don't need to you think that i'm right on everything, I'm just a little tired of Reddit assuming cops are all a bunch thugs who wake up everyday with the purpose of making people miserable and abusing power. I broke this video down myself and then with a group of students studying the criminal justice process and the only portions that really seem suspect are the punches after the suspect is handcuffed and the language used by the officers in the second arrest. It doesn't mean that we're right and everyone else is wrong, but we DO have an idea of what we're talking about.  Yeah you were, what, a security guard at one time?  Thanks for your expertise Paul Blart.

Yeah, and the takedown is pretty violent for a man being nonviolent and not running away.  I bet the police were just angry that he was giving them some lip and not cowering like a little bitch. 

And it's normal to have 7 or so police cars to arrest a young man shouting out loud about (what he feels is) police abuse?  Please explain to me how/why OPD sends out that many cars when they can't even respond to complaints of disorderly drunks within 2 hours?

 > And it's normal to have 7 or so police cars

I counted 13. Fucking *13*.  Point one, yes, I'm a rent-a-cop, you can yell about that all you want, I have no particular respect for my current profession, but it is in lieu of being a police officer one day and in the meantime I do spend quite a bit of time learning about situations like the one in the video I'd say I'm at least more qualified to deconstruct it than you are. From what I can tell you're just a professional troll and that's hardly a more respectable position than the lousy job I have to do to pay rent. 

What would you do? there are a few ways to bring someone your same size to the ground on your own and none of them are particularly gentle. Clearly the officers both had tasers out prior to going hands-on meaning he was already clearly not following their instruction. It became immediately clear to the approaching officer that the suspect was not going to comply with him while standing, so the officer took him to the ground in an attempt to gain the upper-hand. The suspect was clearly not seriously injured and was able to walk on his own back to the cruiser when he was later picked up. 

And yes, while the response was excessive, it was merely miscommunication. An officer likely put out a backup call, and just as you would likely respond very quickly to assist YOUR coworkers if you believed their lives may be in danger, these cops fear the worst and try to ensure that their work family is safe just as anyone would. Ideally the responding supervisor would have called off the cavalry as soon as it was clear the threat had been mitigated, but its not a major issue and didn't cause any harm.  fucking christ, I didn't bother counting, I assumed only "9" or so and was trying to be conservative in my estimate. SPECIAL OFFICER DOOFY I honestly can't understand the rustled jimmies required for 13 squad cars to respond within a couple of minutes. Were they all sitting around the corner jerking off in their cars waiting to fuck up some black folks?  The amount of respect I have for you just keeps growing. I just don't know how you manage to be so eloquent.  And listen to what the police officer says to the man after arresting him--the one that was announcing the abuse.  Straight up obviously furious at him and trying to dominate and intimidate him for publicly trying to bring attention to what he thought was abuse.
