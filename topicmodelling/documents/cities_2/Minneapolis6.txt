Strib article: 'Working caregivers take on a second shift in aging America' Anyone read this and have any commentary on it? It's the front page on the site right now if you want to read it.

There is a picture of grandma sitting there at the dinner table in a wheelchair and she already looks like a corpse. Holy God in Heaven. I am thankful every day that my parents are in good health and don't require any outside assistance, yet. Have you seen the cost of assisted living though? It's equivalent to a mortgage on a high\-end house.

God willing give me 75 good years and strike me down in my sleep. I don't want to live to 98 and be demented and blind and crippled. It sounds like a living nightmare, kind of like the book 'Johnny Got His Gun' aka the Metallica song \(and video\) One.  


My great aunt just passed recently. She was 93. My mom would visit her, and while the aunt would talk about the weather and little small talk things she had no clue who most people were. The aunt was my grandma's twin and my mom looks a lot like them also. After visiting with my mom one day the aunt told her daughter she saw her sister today. Her sister has been dead since 1963. Wild stuff.
