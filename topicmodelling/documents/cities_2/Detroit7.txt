If you missed Maker Faire Detroit 2012, don't worry we got you covered. - Day 2: Detachable Power Drive for Standard Wheelchairs.  We have about 10 hours of footage to dig through and this is the first. Hope to get it all edited and out over the next 2 weeks. Next up is a great interview with i3 the ferndale makershop, The Coke and Mentos guys (super neat), and US First Robotics. Had a blast at Maker Faire, looking forward to this year! Not to rain on your parade but a detachable drive unit has no market. If it's not permanently affixed then it's not "Medically Necessary" and so insurance and/or medicaid won't be covering the unit even if it's written for. As well as the fact it will be extremely hard to get a doctor to write a prescription for it in the first place. If you think people might buy it themselves then you are really overestimating the disposable income of the average wheelchair user. I think this kids main hope would be for someone that has been stuck with a non powered chair having the ability to attach this without having to pay for a whole new powered chair.
