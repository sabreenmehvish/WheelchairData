How do I find friends if I'm new to L.A.? I should lead by saying that I'm in a wheelchair and was diagnosed with ALS last year.  I think it's even harder for me to meet people because of the disability thing and because I can't do all the things healthy people can.  But hey, I can still hang and drink a beer or participate in group discussion.  I really just have no idea where to start.  Been here almost a year and the only person I hang out with is my girlfriend.  I love music and movies and I do chat up strangers at shows or at bars.  But I really just feel the disability throws a lot of people off.  Never had this issue in the past.  Any tips or suggestions are sincerely appreciated.   Oof. Making friends is already [challenging enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/search?q=make+friends&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) in this city. But there are still a lot of activities that I think you might be able to participate in - bar trivia (you can have a wacky team name ripping on the wheelchair, this is a bad one, but like "The 5th and 6th wheel". You can do better), improv class(?), other types of classes (beer brewing! new languages! etc), volunteering (reading to kids at library during break). I mean, the general rule of thumb is activities and volunteering - and I think both of those avenues are still open to you. Try LA meetups (google it). Found a few cool people to play video games and dungeons and dragons  with etc. but there are also hiking groups, photography groups, movie groups etc., that fit your interests. good luck!
