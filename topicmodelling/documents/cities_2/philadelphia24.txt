Remember when I was looking for a wheelchair? Macromaniacal went out of his way.  Whatta guy! My brother got orthopedic surgery for his knee (Tore his miniscus and ACL).  We wanted to go to the Eagles game yesterday, and were desperate for a wheelchair.  [Macromaniacal](http://www.reddit.com/user/macromaniacal) went out of his way to bring us the wheelchair. Whatta guy!

I gave him some of my homemade fudge in return.  The best I could do.

Give this guy some props!  Here's a [picture of my dad, my brother, and my sister's boyfriend](http://i.min.us/idAS4w.jpg).
 That fudge is amazing btw! No problem on the wheelchair, I hope it worked out alright I feel bad.  I missed the boyfriend part and thought it was a picture of you your dad your brother and your sister, and I was going to say "Which one is the sister?" because they all look like men.
