I'd like to rent a wheelchair from you. Hi! My roommates and I want to go look at Christmas lights tomorrow night. But my boyfriend has a broken foot, so moving around is really hard for him. We're hoping to rent a simple medical wheelchair, just for a couple hours tomorrow night. If you happen to have a wheelchair you're not using, and you would be okay with me borrowing it in exchange for some money, please message me! 


Thanks for reading! You should pull him around in a Radio Flyer wagon.  Crutches. Wheelbarrow could work too... Spruce it up with some lights and have a ball.  I have a transport WC you may borrow. Will message. You could always "borrow" a Costco shopping cart...  I have one you can have, it needs some cleaning.  A former tenant left it behind, it's been sitting on my back porch for a few months.   This was actually our first idea... but then we realized none of us own one.  We've got them- he's REALLY SLOW. It's totally fine for short distances, and then all of a sudden he's moving at negative speed.  This is actually pretty adorable! Yeah, hobo probably will be strenuous tho ha...at least you'll have killer forearms afterwards
