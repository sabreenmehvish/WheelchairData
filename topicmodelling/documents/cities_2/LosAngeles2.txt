Man in wheelchair fatally struck by car in Long Beach  I’m familiar with that area. It’s a huge intersection. The person in the wheelchair was not using the crosswalk according to the article, and knowing the people in the area there’s a chance that it was a full green light and the person in the wheelchair dgaf. Also, it’s pretty empty on the street at that hour, so drivers may drive faster or less carefully. 

I’ll stop generalizing now and say that this is tragic. Please be mindful of pedestrians, jaywalking or not, when you drive city roads. I know it may not be your fault as a driver if the pedestrian is in the wrong, but this is not something anyone needs on their conscience.  Saw the aftermath of this last night driving home around 10:30 ish. I had a pit in my stomach the second I saw the person lying on the ground not moving :/ Wow, I thought the title said; "Man in wheelchair **finally** struck by car in Long Beach." I was quite confused after not finding any mention of why this could possibly be the relief of some story I didn't know. Turns out, as is often the case, I'm dumb.
