San Jose Earthquakes' "Bash Bros." visit San Jose Steamrollers wheelchair soccer team  I don't know how much sports related material is posted here, but this seemed appropriate. It is quite awesome that the city not only hosts a professional club but also two of these power wheelchair teams. I hope this isn't the last interaction between all these guys and gals!
