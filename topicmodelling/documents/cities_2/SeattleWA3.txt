Scooting across 2nd and Union, not following bike lane signal  "Why yes, I would like to die thank you"

Damn, that is some dumbass dangerous shit. My brother used to refuse to look both ways when crossing the street. "If I get hit, I'll sue", he would often say.  

Well better hope I dont witness it, because im not going to perjure myself for you and im not going to be there to change your colostomy bag every day, when your injuries limit you to a wheelchair.  This is why Vision Zero or whatever itâ€™s called is a pipe dream; you can reduce fatalities among non-automobile road users, but some people will always just be fucking suicidal.  He will be dead before summer is over That guy will be lucky until the day he dies. Natural selection! He'll be dead soon. Darwin was on a smoke break. >If I get hit, I'll sue

Perfect inscription for his gravestone. > Vision Zero

Perfect term for what was going on between the scooter and that car. You can't prevent stupid no matter how hard one may try. Vision Zero is more about building infrastructure that prevents collisions even when people are stupid. 

And Vision Zero is about all road users, including automobile drivers. The idea is that no one should be dying because of cars. 

*Edit: autocorrect* /r/watchpeoplecheatdeath If we're lucky "I'm a millionaire!" ...confined to a wheelchair. Hell no I don't want him to die.  They will lower the limits downtown to 10 mph because of "safety"
