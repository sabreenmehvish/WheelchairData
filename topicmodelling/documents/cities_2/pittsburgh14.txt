I'm fat. Which local theaters (performance theaters not movie theaters) have seating that physically accommodate me? I understand I should lose weight.  If you want to insult me, please refrain and move along.  I got enough of that from my ex, so I don't need it from you.

I think The Rex is standing room only, so that's fine for me.  A friend told me that the Carnegie Library Music Hall will put a folding chair in the space where a wheelchair can go, but I would like to avoid the embarrassment.  I fit in standard movie theater seats without an issue.  What are seats like at the Benedum, Byham, etc? Byham was painful to me when I was bigger, Carnegie Homestead music hall would also be a bad experience.  Are you tall as well?  The O'Reilly theater is terrible, not much room for your legs.  I got last minute tickets at Heinz Hall for In the Heights . We were in the side boxes (felt like Royalty).  The seats are chairs which you can move to your liking.  It was  worth it! The Cabaret at Theater Square would be good. It's not traditional theater seating at all (tables & chairs) & has decent shows. I'd say the byham and benedum center seats are close and maybe a little bit smaller to the seats at pnc park if that helps.  I don't have specifics, but you're generally going to be looking for newer theatres if they have traditional seats.   We started going wider in about 2004, by about 2010 seats were about 2" wider on average than in 2000-- and a good 3-4" wider than they were in the 80's.  
 Mr Smalls is standing room on the main floor, if you're looking for a music concert. carnegie homestead seats are terrible. i am pretty small and the seats were just old and uncomfortable. my ex who is 6'2" 200 was in agony just sitting for an hour or so. we were upstairs tho.  The balcony seating is different then the floor seating in many venues especially for leg room. im not overweight at all and practically don't fit in the damn seats at the carnegie homestead music hall. those things are the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever been in.  Pittsburgh Public Theater (The O'Reilly) has seats on the third floor that are wider,and are actual chairs that move around, they are more comfortable. The theater is not as big as places like The Bennedum, so being on "the third floor" is not super far away from the stage.  [deleted] I've been upstairs and in the first 5 rows and it doesn't matter. My 6'3" 200lb boyfriend was in agony for most of it both times, though getting him an aisle seat helped a little. I've only been to one show at Carnegie Homestead but I recall not minding it.  6'3 but I was on the floor. Not the last time I was there. (which was a few months ago). 200 lb â‰ˆ 90 kg
