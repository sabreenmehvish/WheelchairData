Dog wheelchair for medium-large dog? Hi All! Weird question here. I have a Walkin' Wheels chair for my dog who can't move her back legs, but she hates it and refuses to move in it. Her therapists are encouraging us to use a chair, which may help stimulate some movement in her lower legs, but she just flops over and cries in her current chair. 

Does anyone know of a place that may have donated chairs? I'd be more than happy to donate her Walkin Wheels in exchange for one she likes and that fits her better (the company won't take the chair back) but can't afford to buy her a new chair. 

I really appreciate any help! Thanks so much :) Come on over to r/disableddogs! 

Chairs can be hard to come my donated, but there's a lot of resources. http://lessonsfromaparalyzeddog.com/how-to-get-a-donated-dog-wheelchair-for-your-paraplegic-pet/ There's all kinds of info on this page. Hopefully it helps. There was also a post somewhere about a guy who built one out of pvc pipe and duct tape for <$30. Maybe as a temporary measure until something else works out.  There was a post on /r/DIY a few days ago about someone that built their own doggy wheelchair.  Aw, you're a good person u/Wookie-dog. 

There *are* still good people in the world.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/69tav0/my_diy_dog_wheelchair_for_about_30/ I love this idea!! Right now we are trying to find or make one that will encourage back leg movement but if we ever give up I'm totally going to try making one like this :) he looks so comfy!! I cried seeing this. Our dog became suddenly paralyzed (the vet said likely spinal issue) and we just didn't know what to do. We didn't know anything about dog carts and it looked like he would have to be crated and basically immobile all day while we worked and what kind of life is that? We cried for days after making the decision to put him to sleep. I have never stopped feeling guilty about it, especially later when we found out there were options. I miss him.
