What are some free things that might be fun for a physically handicapped person to do in the portland area? I work with an older person who uses a walker and is on a fixed income, looking for free places to get her out for some fun that will not require much walking. There are a bunch of events happening for [Rose Festival,](http://www.rosefestival.org/event-calendar) many are free.

The [Oregon Historical Society Museum](http://www.ohs.org/museum/) and the [Oregon Rail Heritage Center](http://www.orhf.org/oregon-rail-heritage-center/) are cool. 

The lower level of [The Grotto](https://thegrotto.org/) is free, the upper level is $6, $5 for seniors. 

If she likes cats and coffee or tea, there's [Purringtons cat lounge.](http://purringtonscatlounge.com/home/) 

Second Tuesdays at the Oregon Zoo are $4. If it's too much distance and she's ok with the idea, you can rent wheelchairs there for $10.

There should also be a lot of free summer events coming up, like Shakespeare and movies in the parks.
Hope you both have a fun summer!
 It's a little late in the day but the art museum has free admission on the first Thursday from 5-8. Also It's not free but Friday's 5-8 it's only $5 for Admission   If she doesn't mind crowds, street fair season is upon us. They are free and have different stuff to look at.  I wish I had more suggestions . 

I love walking around and everything I can think of is a walk, a hike, or a bike ride. 

My mom works with the elderly in another state and she has had good luck with resources like this:

 McMenamins Kennedy School and Grand Lodge are very wheelchair accessible.  Good for food, drinks and movies Peninsula park rose garden has lots of lovely views with minimal walking. McMenamin's chapel pub is close by with indoor and outdoor seating. Combo are a nice low impact afternoon. Perhaps visit the waterfalls? Start at the scenic Crowne Point, and drive along the historic Columbia river hwy to see all of the falls, Multnomah Falls being the most popular.  These folks have a pretty comprehensive site on regional parks with trails that are wheelchair or mobility friendly: http://accesstrails.org/Phase_1/Map.html
 The huge OMSI theatre has interesting documentaries sometimes.

Does she like art? You could go to a pottery painting place! 

 Shakespeare in the parks should be starting up soon.

Also all the [free summer events](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/61921) in various parks. Cat cafe *slash* adoption center? That makes too much sense. Actually was at Willamette falls when I posted this She uses a walker and gets very tired after about 20 feet or so and needs to sit and rest. Anything that involves much walking is out.

I tried taking her to a regular park today, paved and all. Took her about half an hour to walk the perimeter of the playground. It was 400 feet of walking at the most. I wish we could, but she's both physically disabled and unable to afford to pay for entertainment.  Perfect :D It is a cool place for cat lovers and potential adopters, but it's not free to visit. [deleted] Ahh I see. Nope. I mean if you want to send me $50 i'll take it and probably spend it on something lame like beer or rent or doing fun things on my own time, but i'm forbidden from spending my own money on clients, or else i'd have at least gotten her into the zoo or something with that second Tuesday deal.  I could geocache money on your walk route she could find and then it would be hers, but up to you. Check out First Thursday art walk down near/in the Pearl:

http://www.firstthursdayportland.com/ If only. I don't think she's someone who would really grasp the concept. Most of the people i work with need things kept a little simpler than that.  geocaching represent! I don't work with her on thursdays, but i'll definitely see if anyone does and can give that a shot.
