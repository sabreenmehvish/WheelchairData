Recon Request: 8th Street near Market My SO is confined to a wheelchair and needs to go down 8th Street from Market to Spruce. Anyone in the area know whether or not this is viable at the moment? [deleted] I work around the corner from there. Just let them know some of the ramps from the sidewalks aren't totally clear and just have footprint wide paths into the street. May get a bit slushy, but should be alright to get through. I misread this as "Bacon Request" and was really disappointed. Market East is a vast wasteland. She will be fine. Thanks for the quick response! You're disappointed? I could have conned you into sending me bacon!
