Looking for a two-bedroom between 600 and 900 a month? Me and my dad are just looking for a place. He's in a wheelchair, so it has to be handicap accessible. I feel a little bad just sort of begging for help, but I thought maybe someone knew of a place or lived somewhere similar? I believe Cielo apartments on nacogdoches is in your price range. City Base Vista on the southeast side is around $830 for a 2 bedroom with cable. Bronco Apartments - 2/1 995Sq ft is $615/mo. Canyon Oaks on Henderson Pass is in your price range too.  I loved it htere.

You may also want to contact Liz Franzone, she may be able to help you out and have deals.  http://www.zillow.com/profile/LizFranzone/ I drove through there on my scooter the other day. Seems pretty nice.  Had a friend live there. They have mold issues and are weary to fix them. Be careful.  Yeah I lived there for 3 years, only moved out recently. It's a really small complex so it's nice and quiet. Also has some handicap parking as well.
