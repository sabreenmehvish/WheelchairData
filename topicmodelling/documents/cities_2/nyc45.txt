Wheelchair available I have a wheelchair available if someone is in need. It is one of those solid build hospital kind, not the light weight comfortable ones. If anyone needs one and can't afford to buy or knows someone or some organization in need please let me know. I got rid of my Mom's old wheelchair on Craigslist. The Craigslist Free classified section is like a free garbage removal service. You can get all your junk hauled away for free just by posting it there. I should offer bags of garbage for free. I first wanted to get it to someone who can't afford one. Craig's list is next.
