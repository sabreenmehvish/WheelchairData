Driver flees after hitting a 70-year-old man in an electric wheelchair on his way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.  Chances are the driver should be in AA too. So much for staying anonymous... Why isn't there a story like this each time a shitbag hits a cyclist and drives off? Where's the outrage? Oh wait he wasn't hit by a cyclist.  Because it happens all the time, I personally know 5 people who've been hit at least once while cycling. Same reason there's no outrage over shooting on the South and West side, after a while it just becomes background noise to most people.  Dude get off it. This has nothing to do with bikers vs. drivers. he's also brown Well I dunno. In this subreddit drivers can do no wrong. That's why there are hardly any comments for this story.
