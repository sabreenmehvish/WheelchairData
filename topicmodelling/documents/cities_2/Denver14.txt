Wheelchair-bound Denver gang shooting victim accused of killing Aurora toddler  Regarding the attempted murder case he was just acquitted on yesterday, I was in the jury pool of 75 for that on Tuesday, but got dismissed with 20 left. The guy looked like real scum and he had a half dozen gangster friends in the back glaring at the jury. I had no idea about this 2nd case, looks like he'll be back in court soon. Also glad you linked this, was wondering how this weeks case would turn out.  What on earth. I can't believe the things people do.
