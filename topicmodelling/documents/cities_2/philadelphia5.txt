Will PPA come after your new car? I've been on the boot list for quite some time now and I've done very well dodging PPA when I'm in their heavily patrolled areas. Now I have a new car and was wondering if they link license plates together to take your new car if you still owe money on other license plates? The will absolutely grab you Yes pay your fines  Pay your fucking tickets, ya jamoke! Pay your debts  Yes, if they catch you they will boot your new car. You will have to pay the tickets and you missed the opportunity to settle up with the city at a discounted rate last year.  I hope so. ITT: Deadbeat Problems [removed] Talk to your bank. Sometimes banks will get your car out of PPA lockup and tack the difference on to your payments.  Eventually they'll pass a law saying you can't renew your license if any vehicle registered to you has outstanding tickets.

That happened in California a couple'f decades ago after they finally impounded some guy's Fiat with over $10,000 in outstanding tickets. The car was worth about $1,200, and he told 'em to keep it. They will absolutely steal your car, yes. Hold up, yall really support PPA and all they’ve done for the city? [removed] Oh? I’ll check it out, thanks much

How I get negative votes thanking someone for their comment? That’s crazy but makes sense, I was about to get my new car at one of those auctions. I heard they got some nice cars there. I support ticketing people who violate parking laws, yes. And I’m a fan of the revenue the PPA has helped the city generate. Answer my question, what makes you so special that you get the privilege to park on a sidewalk? Ummmmmm look at the replies then their respective upvotes. You said that you have a boot and you are avoiding paying fines; therefore, it's difficult to muster up sympathy. Feel me?  I'm obliged by blood oath to use this time as a reminder that the PPA is run by the state and revenue 90% of the revenue it generates does not come to the city. As far as a parking authority, they are fine. People who think that the city would be better off without any parking authority at all are Luddites. > I support ticketing people who violate parking laws

That's really all for me :P You're aware they don't give the city almost any of their money right The only tickets I get are between 1-3am when I park on the sidewalk in front of my place. Only reason I haven’t been towed is because it’s only police that ticket me. I work late and leave the car there from 11-6. Why should I have to park 4 blocks away every night?! That’s inaccurate. Take a look at the PPA’s 2017 annual report. 🙄 Because that’s the nearest legal place to park.

Why should you be exempt from parking regulations?  4 blocks isn't that far. I had to park a 45 min walk once. just walk. > when I park on the sidewalk

Fuck you, sidewalks are for pedestrians, not parking.

> Why should I have to park 4 blocks away every night?!

Because you own a car in a dense city. If you don’t like it you should move somewhere where parking isn’t a scarcity. Why the fuck are you so special that you can park on the sidewalk because you dont own the friggin sidewalk, people in wheelchirs, people walking have right to the side walk

They do give some money to the city for the appearance of legitimacy. I have no doubt they are reporting that they are giving it all back to the city. You ever seen Memento? Imagine the PPA logo on Polaroid and on the back is written "don't believe his lies" A fuck you? Damn I just asked a simple question. I bet you’d have your hands tucked in pocket lookin like a victim out here “pedestrians” 😂 🙄 Is this going to be one of those threads where everyone keeps telling you that you’re wrong and you just keep doubling down? I get it I’m wrong, tried to plead a bit (with the times I park) and realized again I’m wrong. Only people I’m replying to are the ones saying “fuck you” lord knows they wouldn’t say that shit to anyone’s face I’ll say it again on behalf of my friends and family that use wheelchairs: fuck you. I’ve lived out Southwest the past 20+ nobody using wheelchairs on my block past 2. So fuck you and your wheelchair using grandma that I’ll never see on this side... you walk around looking for craft beers over here? 😂
