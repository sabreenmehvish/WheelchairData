Need wheelchair rental for weekend for PAX My friends and I will be in Seattle soon for PAX (Convention) but one of them decided to rupture one of his Achilles Tendon. So now we're trying to figure out where we would rent a wheelchair or one of those really fancy crutches things where one foot is kept elevated.

Can anyone help us out? If it's just one foot, the wheeled knee scooters are great for zooming around. Access Medical Equipment

Have a fun trip! don't forget to contact pax and request a disabled pass! If you need to ship something and are worried about it going out in time use Amazon Locker.
 Why would you rent one?  Airports accommodate this sort of thing.  knee scooters are wonderful. They sell for about 220$ online. Totally worth it if he's going to be out for a while.

I'd take it over a wheelchair any day, so ask at Access Medical maybe for a scooter if they have one. Get an electric one, offer cute girls rides.  For the record, I rented one here for my Halloween costume. They had like 30 of em.  Airports do but once we leave the airport, we would still need a wheelchair for him to get around effectively.
