Dad with ALS gets up from his wheelchair and congratulates his son at his Air Force graduation. â€¢ r/gifs  Posting because the Air Force basic training is located at Lackland AFB. Sometimes I feel like we have no right to view such intimate moments between other human beings. Beautiful, nonetheless. [deleted] We always need to see things like this. It's pretty much the only thing keeping me from being Clint Eastwood in Gran Turino. Ummm...He got up because he went to *tap* out his son, who just graduated from basic training.  The Airman stays at parade rest until a family member, friend, fellow Airman, etc. *taps* you to recognize your graduation from basic training.  It was a honor for the father to be the one to do it.

Though, reading your past posts, you just sound disgruntled & bittered about everything. [deleted] Nah.
