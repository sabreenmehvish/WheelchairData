Has anyone used the wheelchair seats at Jacobs Pavilion? I want to buy two tickets to a show there with a handicap guest, but I noticed the available wheelchair seats are in the middle of the row, which seemed strange. Usually they're at the back of the section in an open area at many venues. Anyhow, for the safety of my guest I really need to be able to keep them in the wheelchair and wheel them straight to/from the seats, so has anyone used the wheelchair seating at this venue and is able to comment?

If not I'll call the venue, they just aren't open today and I'm trying to get the tickets purchased.
