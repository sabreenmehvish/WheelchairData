The Myth of Wapato Jail * **Myth #1**: *Wapato is too far away from Downtown.*
* Fact: The #11 bus goes along NE Marine Drive. Wapato is situated just south of that. A simple bus line extension (a slight 1/2+ mile adjustment along a looped road into a turn-around cul-de-sac adjacent to the facility (that is accessible by wheelchair) would solve **all** transit accessibility problems. From there, it is a 10 minute bus ride to a MAX station. Other options include riding the #11 to the #16 through St. Johns across the bridge, which is about a 30+ min. ride to NW 23rd and Overton.

Additional ride services could be added to increase trips. Note, a bus line was added to Dignity Village.

The county also [recently opened up a facility SE on 160th and Stark.](http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/02/former_strip_club_reopens_as_h.html). If Wapato were to have a simple bus line extension, the commute time to downtown would be shorter than this facility they opened!

* **Myth #2**: *Services are all downtown.*
* Fact: Some are. Some aren't. Do all services need to be accessed downtown? Services can easily be added to on site. Services include drug treatment and rehab, counseling, job training -- things that are not entirely immobile. Refer to Myth #1.

* **Myth #3**: *Wapato is too far away from jobs.*
* Fact: Wapato is close to many manufacturing jobs. This includes the Port of Portland (including the Airport), Swan Island and manufacturing in Vancouver. Given congestion and its proximity to Hwy 30, it arguably takes less time to get to the NW Industrial area than people coming from other areas of the metro area (Hwy 30). What does the data show: are people who are homeless and looking for work more likely to work downtown in white collar jobs or are in manufacturing (serious, non-stereotyping question)? What location has better avenues for job training?

* **Myth #4**: *A jail has too much stigma attached to it.*
* Fact: The building has never once held an inmate. Old Town has many social services in buildings that were once brothels and places of crime and villainy and murder. The previous use of a building is an irrelevant logical fallacy to determine if it's a worthy place to house people. Leaving people to die under a bridge has more stigma to it than this being designed as a jail.

* **Myth #5**: *You're sweeping the problem under the rug.*
* Fact: Leaving people outside is sweeping the problem under the rug, this is addressing it in a resource-wise manner.

* **Myth #6**: All housing must be in inner Portland.
* Fact: Does that mean Dignity Village is a failure and should be closed?

Good op-ed:

Contact the county chair and your commissioner if you're interested in getting Wapato on the table:

 I honestly was expecting some kind of legend of a squatter or scary ghost story. 

Great post,  I wish the county/city would get in gear and use this faciltlity for something. Seems like a no-brainer.  [deleted] Thanks for doing this.  As I've said, the official report on why the place can't be used seemed to be made up of excuses, and not insurmountable hurdles.  If you want to read all of them, it can be found here:

> Note, a bus line was added to Dignity Village.

I don't believe this is correct, and the location had service well before the village arrived.  Also, they did run a private shuttle out to the Sears building in SW when it was used as a shelter. Nice write up. Jeez, redditors are doing better journalism than our paper of record!  Extremely well said and laid out. Agree 100% with everything said. The excuse of no bus service or social services out there is the weakest excuse I have ever heard.  

Why do we need to build a 120 MILLION dollar river front one stop homeless condo downtown when we already have one built and ready that would serve the same purpose? 

Open this up, sweep the camps. Enough is enough. If this were to happen and made easy to get into wouldn't it also make enforcing the sidewalk sleeping problem easier? You should re-title your post. It should read "Why the homeless can't live at Wapato: The Myths of poor location." I approve of this message..makes sense..its already paid for....send em to ikea to brighten it up and good to go Great summary of the hurdles (not barriers) to using Wapato. The real barrier comes from the homeless advocacy and service organizations. They have made up their mind that Wapato is not an option, and our elected officials fear the blowback of ignoring those groups. ^^Signed up to post this

Ok, new user here... Isn't (wasn't) the argument of Wapato being substandard/unfit for residency being trotted out whenever the above arguments are countered with truth. To the tune of millions of dollars in "required" code upgrades or retrofits? I can help you out with that. The county likes to have that as a "fuck you" to the voters.  You insist we build a jail, fine, we will.  But we will never fund it because fuck you. Well if we open it and offer services then all the people who whine that we need to coddle the homeless won't have a leg to stand.  Then police* should be able to do their jobs again and remove people sleeping on sidewalks.  Many people would rather have housing than live in the park and there is not enough housing for those people. Lotteries and wait lists at shelters and places with affordable housing conform this.

What exactly do you think you can do to someone who is homeless and addicted to meth that will make their live harder than it is already? I could be wrong then, but I don't often see these kinds of bus routes:

You might have to toggle on the "transit" linework. Yeah, I was under the impression that there were strict restrictions on the jail due to it being funded by public bonds by ballot measure (Oregon should not be funding single projects by ballot measure). Once I looked into it, the bond pay off was not prohibitively high. Remember the Packwood days... "If it matters to Oregonians, it's in the Washington Post."

Did you hear Nordstrom is having a Packwood sale? All dresses, half off. It's not possible to retitle posts after submission.  I was hoping you would show up! So....  does that mean we need a public referendum? Uugh waaaay too much work. 

If our lawmakers insist on being so damn lazy/complacent* we need some direct democracy phone app I can submit bug fixes to. They couldn't find it because the at the same time the voters approved the bond to build the jail, voters voted in an anti-property tax measure that stripped the county of 20% of its tax revenue. It was much cheaper to not use the facility and man it with a skeleton crew.

This all happened because voters are stupid and ill-informed when it comes to ballot initiatives. For every good one that passes, there's been a horrible one that puts government into a straitjacket. The mayor's entire position has been that we cannot enforce a camping ban because we don't have adequate shelter space. If we did, theoretically that would mean we can enforce the ban. I have zero doubt Hales would find some other excuse to allow "travelers" to do whatever, but at least having adequate shelter would allow the city to pursue options preventing camping.  I'm genuinely curious, why do you think people camping in the park blocks would prefer to be somewhere else? I walk by there every day and the campers are just constantly wasted or shooting up. I see zero desire to get clean, no effort to make it into treatment and no attempts to move away from the schools. They all seem perfectly content being totally wrecked and I sincerely doubt any of the inhabitants have any desire to better themselves.  [deleted] Yes, there isn't much out there. but there is the prison next door, and the armory.  The route's gone out there since at least the 90's: http://web.archive.org/web/19970716221652/http://www.trimet.org/schedule/r010.htm

Also, speaking about transit for homeless, Boston has a special route just for a shelter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MBTA_bus_routes#195 And I think if the county actually wanted to use it as a shelter instead of nothing, the state would be willing to work with them to get the bond issue taken care of. Wow, Bob Packwood jokes.  Now that takes me back.

I heard AT&T hired him to be their spokesman for their "Reach out and touch someone" ad campaign.
 Good to know. Thanks! Portland doesn't have a 311 hotline..? Talk about incompetent. It's on Google Maps and everything: https://goo.gl/maps/6onQBRjhpNJ2 Luckily hales won't be around much longer.  I'm still hopeful Wheeler will clean it up some regardless but let's not allow that excuse to continue.  As I mentioned, there are not enough shelters to supply the demand for them. This shows that there are people who would rather use facilities, like Wapato, than be outside. This was the point I was making which was counter to the idea that

>people would much rather shoot smack in the north park blocks 

I am sure some people would rather continue to use drugs than be in a shelter. That's not really relevant when you have people who want shelter and can't get it. thumbs up x 1,000 Nice find, btw! I love the sleuthing work. I stand corrected that the stop was added, however, the application of a looped route similar to DV is not impossible for this site. I've never heard of a 311 hotline before.  Just dialed it.  Not in service.  So no, portland and probably most of Oregon do not want to hear from the public.  Just go away and keep sending more money to piss away. Well I meant it more as like needing to get actual legislation passed saying "this jail we paid for must be used for SOMETHING" than a getting pothole filled. Wheeler has gotten more and more after the election (to avoid the ire of the SJWs and quixotics like Ianarrooonne) that allowing camping does not work and that will change next year. Probably not until after the rains stop, but we're gonna see change.

Allowing camping introduced more problems than playing whac-a-mole. Including for the homeless - the homeless-on-homeless violence this year was because Hales enabled them to feel they could do as they pleased. Yes, you "mentioned" that. What evidence do you have to support that assertion? My experience has been the opposite. The vast majority of travelers I encounter don't seem to have any interest in shelter or treatment.  How does the Portland tax paying public get to a point where we are comfortable that your ideas are representative?  I don't think there's a lot of riders on the 11 to be inconvenienced by such a detour.  The real issue is that it doesn't run often, but that could be solved or an alternative implemented. Huh. Austin has a 311 app that people mostly use to report potholes and noise complaints. Almost exactly what /u/NEPXDer was talking about Are you asking for evidence that there are not enough shelters to meet demand? If so, I could point to [this article](http://www.pressherald.com/2016/07/12/portlands-family-homeless-shelter-cant-keep-pace-with-demand/) about family shelters being filled beyond capacity or [this article](http://news.streetroots.org/2016/02/04/portland-homeless-family-shelter-offers-refuge-storm) that mentions rooms being assigned by lottery. If there is an unmet demand, then obviously that demand is coming from an existing population. Good points. The crux of me bringing this up is Wapato is a mere 10 minute ride to MAX. Could be accomplished by a shuttle service too. We actually do have like a pothole report and that kind of thing app but its been ignored for a while by the city it seems.  There was a brief time where it seemed to be working. If you want to try reporting by phone, the pothole hotline is (503) 823-BUMP.
