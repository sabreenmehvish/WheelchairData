Brighton family pleads for the return of 6-year-old girl’s stolen wheelchair  What the fuck is wrong with people Hopefully someone returns that chair ASAP but If this situation doesn’t necessitate a go-fund-me idk what does! How much is a new chair?  Can we get her a new one? These are my next door neighbors. They are the nicest family ever, and they adore their daughter. It really sucks that this happened to them. People suck. I am getting really tired of living in this world.  This is just sad all around.  Those chairs are really that expensive and it helps her get out and meet people.  I don't get how people can be so heartless and cruel like that Hopefully they'll start locking it up better when they get a new one. Losers cut through locks to steal shitty $100 mountain bikes; you have to be incredibly naive to think they won't steal an expensive wheelchair  if you keep it outside 24/7.

I know, I know, victim blaming, yadda yadda yadda... It can be kind of a process to get a new chair and seat, depending on her needs.  I ran a dayhab and it's not as easy as going in and trying a bunch of different ones out, even if you have the cash.  They basically have to size it to you and then often they need to make a custom seat.  It can take a while.  I'm not sure how her age affects it, but I imagine that makes it difficult too as she's still growing. In the [CBS](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/07/22/brighton-missing-wheelchair-maliyah-special-needs-police/) article they list it as $3,000 but I haven't seen a GoFundMe page set up yet. I think they're hoping for it to be returned before setting one up. Or you know, just don't steal Good luck with that.
