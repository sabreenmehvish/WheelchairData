Where to watch the Daytona 500 in SA? Anyone know of a wheelchair friendly joint to watch the 500 and get my handicap friend loaded?
 I'm pretty sure that at Twin Peaks/Hooters, if you ask them to put it on a few of the TVs around you, they'll accommodate no problem. Buffalo Wild Wings I'm pretty sure would also. Places like that are a pretty safe bet. The Speedway Sports Bar on Grissom Rd? "Hangout for NASCAR & other sports fans, decked out with multiple TVs, serving basic food & drink."  I'm not 100% sure, but I would think a place called Redneck Heaven would be showing the race. I'm personally a little sad this year. Jr was my guy...I dont know how to watch racing anymore :( Any Buffalo Wild Wings would probably work. Big Danica fan from always as is my buddy. Canâ€™t miss this race.   I hope she does well at Daytona and Indy. She's a tough competitor, and she never really gets the respect she deserved for her career.
