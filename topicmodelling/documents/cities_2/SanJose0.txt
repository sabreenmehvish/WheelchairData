Looking for Manual Wheelchair Users for Exercise Program Hi everybody! I intern for the Timpany Center, a rehab/therapy center that specializes in warm water based movements. We are currently trying to work on a new aquatics based exercise class targeted towards strenghtening wheelchair users. Therefore, we are looking for volunteers who we can try out a few exercises with and to provide feedback. Please PM me for details and thank you for your time!
