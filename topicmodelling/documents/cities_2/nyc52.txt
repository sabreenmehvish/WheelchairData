Depending on the kindness of city strangers A friend and I were walking through the West Village when a young woman pushing a frail old man in a wheelchair asked my friend's help to carry the man up to his brownstone (no elevator) apartment. My friend said OK and the woman found another passerby to help carry the guy, too (I was too busy checking out the street flea market).

I don't know if the man was just slow in giving instructions or just really particular about them...anyway, it took awhile for them to finally get to the apartment and carry him up. My friend said the guy was kind of annoying...but anyway, I thought it was interesting that this old man is dependent on finding at least one stranger (his assistant seemed pretty i-could-give-a-fuck checked out) on the street everyday to help him back up (don't know how he actually gets out of the apartment). I guess it says more about the density of West Village/Manhattan that you could feel confident on any given day you'll find someone who you can appeal to if you're in need (I'm guessing his neighbors probably would've gotten annoyed after a certain point)

That's all, just rambling.
 I hope he has some amazing rent control deal.
