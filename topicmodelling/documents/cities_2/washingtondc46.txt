Murderball in the DMV! For those in the DMV area, my team will be hosting the largest Wheelchair Rugby (formerly known as Murderball) tournament on the east coast locally, March 23-25.

The tournament is the 2018 Atlantic Sectional tournament featuring the top 10 teams on the east coast. 
The tournament will feature some fast pace and intense games, so come watch the best sport youâ€™ve never seen. The event is free and open to the public. It will be at the South Regional Technology and Recreation Complex

7007 Brock Rd
Fort Washington, MD 20744

The teams there will be battling it out to make it into the top 4, who will advance to the USQRA National Championship Tournament, which will take place in Phoenix, AZ in April.
