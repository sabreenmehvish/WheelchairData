Wheelchair accessible haunted houses? Are any of the haunted houses around the valley possible to go through in a wheelchair? I have a friend who loves Nightmare on 13th, but she broke her ankle. With all the stairs and narrow corridors, I don't think she can do that one this year.  >With all the stairs and narrow corridors,

That's interesting... There should be ADA accommodations.  I'd call them and see what they have in place.  go to the Walmart downtown, it's close enough to a haunted house. I don't know of any. Maybe try a haunted corn maze. That seems like it would work. I think there's one at thanksgiving point  Sad for your friend but more sad for handicapped people who have never gotten to go to a haunted house! When I went to Lagoon last weekend, they had special wheelchair doors on their haunted houses, so I am sure they are wheel chair accessible. Maybe they can rent a Hodor.
