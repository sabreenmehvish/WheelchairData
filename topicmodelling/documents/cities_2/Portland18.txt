5-year-old's wheelchair stolen in NW Portland  Dick move. Damn. Those custom chairs cost an arm and a leg. Might be more than the blue book value on a 12 year old Suburban. :\ Is there a GoFundMe to buy the kid a new one? There didn't happen to be diamonds in the the seat cushion... did there?

If so... we really need Jackie Chan here ASAP.  Hope these folks get their wheelchair back for their child. That said, if it's worth more than 50 bucks, and it's in a car unattended in NW it's gone. 

Source: Just had something very expensive stolen from my car.  4th break in down here.   Was that wrong? Should I not have done that? I tell you, I gotta plead ignorance on this one, because had anyone said anything to me at all when I started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon... I'm outraged, who the fuck steals a white Suburban with pink accents? [deleted] I'll take a shot-  

It's because though theft and crime are fairly rampant in our society, there are some things that most people who consider themselves decent, all agree need to be dealt with.   Stealing a wheelchair from a five-year-old is one of those things. because it's a special needs child's wheelchair, they put it on the news hoping someone will see and report so this poor 5 year old can have their wheelchair back...how is this not newsworthy??  Who said posts on Reddit have to be newsworthy?
