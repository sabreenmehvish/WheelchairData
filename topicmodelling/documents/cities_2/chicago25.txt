Moving via taxi? Forgive me if this is a stupid thing to ask. I need to move 4-5 20 gallon tubs from Uptown to Rogers Park. Renting a can seems like a pain for this. I never take cabs so I'm pretty ignorant to them. Think it would be an issue doing this via cab? I'm thinking I could call and ask for a van or SUV but I want to make sure I'm not crazy first. 


Alternately, if anyone is available to help me out with this in exchange for $20 and a sixer of your favorite beer that would be cool. It would only take 30-45 minutes and I'm looking to do this either Friday night or Saturday afternoon.  Go to menards and rent a pickup truck. $19 for the first 75 minutes. http://www.menards.com/main/rentals/c-12556.htm [ZipVan](http://www.zipcar.com/chicago/zipvan) 20 gallon tubs? You moving bodies?  Yes, I have known people to do this via cab. I know that one time things went wrong when the cab company sent a too small cab for the purpose, though a different one was requested.

You may want to double-check on renting a car, or at least I've been lucky in being able to work out this sort of thing for relatively cheap if I stopped in to a location. You might have to wait longer for it to arrive, but you can ask for minivans or whatever. An SUV cab might work, but it's tough to say without knowing the exact make they're going to send. There's a lot of difference between a Ford Explorer and a Scion xB.

You might try Uber (app for iPhone and Android). There you can request an SUV and those are usually luxury models with LOTS of fold-down seat space. It will be pricier than a cab, likely $40-ish. A trip from Wrigleyville to Rogers Park ran a friend of mine $38 plus tip.

Still one Uber booking is still cheaper than two cabs to Rogers Park. Post something up on Craigslist about needing a truck. $20 is a little on the low end, but there's usually someone on there who does small errands.  You can also poke through the ads that are already up.  I found [this guy](http://chicago.craigslist.org/nwc/rid/3856141087.html), though he seems to work mainly in the burbs.  Look around the different sections of the site, and you should find someone.   If you still need help let me know, I'll be transporting some furniture in a van from Pilsen to the northern suburbs this weekend. you might want to try requesting one of the [wheelchair cabs](http://www.wheelchairtraveling.com/wp-content/gallery/chicago-wheelchair-taxis/taxi_chicago_2.jpg) - the inside is just a massive open space. i think you would be able to easily fit 4 tubs. [deleted] You do need your own insurance for this though. OP doesn't seem like they drive. Thanks for the suggestion. The membership costs put this far and above what it would cost me to get a Uhaul.  Don't judge. You try dragging a corpse up Broadway in the middle of the day. I wish! Clothing and books.  I don't think OP should request a wheelchair cab... I don't know how many of those each cab company has, but I wouldn't imagine it would be too many, and it's kind of a dick move to use one when someone actually in a wheelchair might need it. [deleted] If you have your own personal auto insurance, they typically include coverage for rental vehicles. I can't not guarentee it so check your policy before hand and see it includes rental trucks as well. Nope plus the nearest Menards is far. I'm weighing attempting a cab or just renting a Uhaul van since there is a Uhaul place two blocks away. The cab just seems easier.  True, although if OP doesn't have insurance, [one-day car insurance products are available](http://www.carsdirect.com/car-insurance/how-to-get-one-day-car-insurance), though this does add to the cost The membership costs amortize over time, it's useful for random errands and such.  There are usually signup deals with free credit.  And maybe you already have a friend with a membership?

ZipCar also includes insurance and the locations are often much more convenient than UHaul. I...wish I was moving *bodies*? As someone with a disabled family member who can never find an appropriate cab, I appreciate this comment! Yeah I wasn't planning to explore that option.  Home Depot rents trucks also.... More exciting.
