Shooting in gaslamp on sat? anyone know anything else about the shooting at the t mobile store?  was it the old guy in the wheelchair?  or some other dude? It's the [lead story](http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/may/15/man-who-shot-wife-head-identified/) on SignOn at the momemnt Whoa, that happened at 2 PM in a heavy tourist spot?  That's scary and could have been a lot worse.  

The 25 year difference between the husband and wife... there is a shooting in the Gaslamp about once a year.
