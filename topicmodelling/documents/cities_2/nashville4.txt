Any other disabled people here? Hey I'm Chris I'm 25 and have cerebral palsy I browse this reddit all the time  I have Multiple Sclerosis and r/Nashville is my favorite. Nice to meet you. I have a friend in Brentwood with CP. We go watch sports at Buffalo Wild Wings and Jonathans once a month. Those places have great wheelchair access and tables aren't too close together. You're welcome to join us anytime. My nephew is 4, has CP, and recently got a wheelchair. He doesn't live in Nashville, but they come to visit every few months. Is Nashville pretty wheelchair friendly, or are we a city that struggles with handicap access? Spinal cord injury 2.5 years ago, t-4 paraplegic here.  Cool thanks  It struggles but that's mainly because we are not a very walkable city in general. If sidewalks are crap for walking then they're bad for wheelchairs. Nice to meet you  Plus if youâ€™re out of shape and use a wheelchair (like me) then the hills are awful.
