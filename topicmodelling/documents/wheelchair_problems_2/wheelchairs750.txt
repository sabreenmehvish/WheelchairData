Figured I'd ask what everyone thought the best manufacturer for Ultralights is... I've had my TiLite since '08, and it looks like my doc got my medicaid request for an ultralight ok'ed (a near-impossible task, to be sure).  
     I'm driving to St Paul right now, for a sizing appointment at 11 CST. 
      One things for sure; I'm just massively stoked to get a new piece of hardware.  Here's to another very mobile five years! Tilite is probably the best on the market. I've had Invacare as a teen and it was kinda meh. I got my Tilite this summer and I'll never go back. My suggestion, if you've had no issues with Tilite, stick with it. Tilite is a very good ultralight. Probably the best on the market. But if you are looking at trying something else you can look at Sunrise Medicals Q7 or Invacare has the T7A.   

I will warn you that I have seen the caster stem housings fall apart on the Q7 and a frame break on a T7A. Both were covered by warranty but caused some down time. look into Box Wheelchairs. The manufacturer/designer welds everything on the chair thereby minimizing the weight of bolts and other hardware required. I would agree with the rest of the group that TiLite is one of the best manufacturers consistently. 

Last year I let the rep talk me into the Quickie Q7, and I wouldn't go with that model a second time. The stabilizer / grab bar across the back is so tight to the back rest and so thick that it makes it very hard to use a backpack. The design of the front wheel forks seem to be specifically designed to catch on everything.
