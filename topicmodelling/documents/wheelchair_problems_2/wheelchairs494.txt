help with design and finding a builder for... can i even call this a wheelchair? my sister-in-law has birth defects that left her with one very short (maybe 12-in?) leg and deformed hips.  she wears a prosthetic with difficulty and pain and can't really sit or use a (normal) wheelchair.  things are really going downhill for her -- without a comfortable way to walk or use a wheelchair she has very few healthy activities available to her.

i thought maybe a design like a [toddler's wheeled walker](http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1ELipLXXXXXX6XFXXq6xXFXXXA/-font-b-Multifunctional-b-font-Baby-font-b-Walker-b-font-Light-Weight-Baby-Walking.jpg) might work well for her -- the leg holes instead of "chair" keep her hips more upright and not cause her pain, and it lets her use her good leg to move around which she isn't doing enough now.  it would have to be big enough for an adult, yet narrow enough to get through doorways.  maybe with large side wheels like a regular wheelchair too to help navigate slopes.  not sure how to best get in/out of it -- hinged frame that pulls open?  swing-up "door" on side?  pulley / chin-up bar and lower herself into it?

does anyone know if such a thing exists?  i seriously doubt it, but if not... does anyone know of a company or organization they have worked with that might take on such a project?  southern california is a plus, but willing to work with anyone anywhere.

feel free to post a reply or PM me any info.  or any other ideas in general -- i know there isn't always a technology solution for problems.  but i feel terrible that she has almost no activities left she can do and i'm hoping for any idea to help. http://www.adaptivemall.com/indygatrwasi3.html?cmp=googleproducts&kw=indygatrwasi3&gclid=CIaBkdmAyNQCFQSewAodZM8FrQ

See if either of these are close to what may work for her Just found this, what you are looking for is something like a [Kid Walk 2 from Prime Engineering.](http://www.primeengineering.com/product_pages/kidwalk.html)

Or a [Rifton Pacer gait trainer.](http://www.rifton.com/products/gait-trainers/pacer-gait-trainers)
 thank you so much!  i'm glad something at least similar exists.  will contact both of these companies.
