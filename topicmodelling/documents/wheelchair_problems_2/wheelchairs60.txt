Spinergy Solves the “I Need Power, but I Want Manual” Wheelchair Dilemma  Really cool but way too unaffordable on a tattooists pay :(   Really cool, but one of the reasons why I have a manual is so I can lift it (by myself) into my small car. I don't see myself lifting one of these at nearly 100 lbs. You still have to store the unit somewhere and get it in and out of your vehicle. That would likely require a power ramp for most people.

There are power assist models that have a small attachable 20lb battery and a 10 mile range. I have been thinking about getting one of those. I live in a hilly area and my manual gets a bit much at times. But the attachable battery would still fit easily in my car's trunk. Like others,  I definitely prefer the freedom of a manual. That, and I could never afford the $25+ grand, and the additional expenses, that comes with a true power model. From what I have read, even a power assist model will run about 9k before insurance. Still, I have been contemplating going back to school and cannot imagine wheeling myself around that huge, hilly campus without a little help.
