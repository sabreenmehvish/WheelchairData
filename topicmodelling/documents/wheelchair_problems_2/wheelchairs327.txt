Wrist Protection for manual user? Hello! I'm in the process of buying my first chair. I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (and some other comorbidities), which causes chronic fatigue, daily sprains/subluxations/dislocations, easy bruising, etc.

I tried it out at the DME and it was easy on most of my joints, but I noticed that my wrists felt strained when propelling myself. Are there any wrist braces out there that will protect my wrists while I use my wheelchair? Thanks! I'm not sure about wrist bracing per de, but I would recommend the Spinergy LX rims with Flexrim pushrims. I highly recommend them to others, as I requires less force to push and grip, as the rubbery surface of the pushrim allows for better grip friction. 

I have had many injuries to my wrists, and have issues with them when having them be overused. The Flexrims are like a bit of luxury - less pressure, less grip... so easy.  [deleted] Thank you! They come in different colors :D That's perfect! Thank you!
