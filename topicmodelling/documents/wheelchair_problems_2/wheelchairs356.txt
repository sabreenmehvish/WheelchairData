Powerchair recommendations Hey all, so a little backstory about me, I'm a double leg and left arm amputee of 3 years. I also suffered an incomplete spinal cord injury during the accident. It's been a blessing and a curse, my phantom pains aren't too bad, but prosthetics are very challenging.  I've used a manual wheelchair designed for someone with one arm. 

But now that I've tried unsuccessfully at prosthetics for a third time, I'm going to look for a power chair to use for the times when I just can't or don't want to use a manual chair. I think using a power chair sometimes will be good for the long term health of my arm.

Anyways, I'd like to ask for suggestions on one that's maybe suited to someone with one arm as wel? Thanks so much!!

 Most power chairs can be customized for your needs. I like quantum chairs. Your ATP should be able to assist you. Make sure you know what he/she is ordering and dont sign anything until youre satisfied I appreciate the advice but I already chose one. I got the C350 PS with the footplate removed. It felt very stable to me and it works well when you're a double amputee.
