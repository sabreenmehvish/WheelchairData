I am planning a trip to the Grand Canyon. What advice can you give me? I am flying there with my Invacare FDX power wheelchair. I think will need a vehicle, unless there are shuttles around. I don't know where I should stay, I try to be independent and not rely on anyone. I occasionally need help.

I plan on taking full advantage of the disabled thing, whatever free stuff I can do, I'M IN!!

I also like beer a lot. I've not been since my accident, but here are some links that are interesting.

http://www.frommers.com/destinations/grand-canyon-national-park/781829 That's awesome! Good for you, I traveled all over Europe in a power chair last fall.  I have never been to the Grand Canyon but my advice would be to get an Ada room- all hotels have them, just ask. And I would plan on running into trouble and just relax and try to be flexible  When we were there a couple of years ago I was shocked at how small the hotel rooms were in the old on-site hotel.   I barely made it work with my smallish manual chair.     I'd call and explain the size of your chair rather than just assume that all ADA rooms are created equal....  I don't think you'd have the same issue with some of the nearby hotels that are newer.   

Beyond the hotel I was pleasantly surprised at the paved paths although it can be a bit difficult to see the Grand Canyon from them at some points where the wall is too high to see over if you're sitting.
