really quick survey about me designing a shower specifically for those with movement impairment (wheelchair bound, arthritic, etc) it's a really awful questionnaire but I have to create some infographics from results!  This is what comes up for me from your link:

You need permission
This form can only be viewed by users in the owner's organization.

Try contacting the owner of the form if you think this is a mistake. Learn More. Sorry about that I had it set to only accepting responses from members of my university! Not an awful questionnaire by any means. Could use a little rephrasing, sure. You shouldn't speak negatively about it if you need people to fill it  out, especially if it's your own work!
