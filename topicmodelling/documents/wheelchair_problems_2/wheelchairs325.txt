Looking for night time visibility items such as lights and reflective tape. I have a friend who is wheelchair-bound, It is his only way to get around his apartment as well as sometimes being out late at night when there is no bus service. 

We are looking for a light that sits above his head and can either connect to his battery or a built in USB port(5v) The light would have to have an on/off switch that can reach from the light/pole to his joystick that controls the chair. His chair is a Quickie Pulse 6. He sometimes has to ride in the street due to poor sidewalk conditions so He wants something that flashes that could get a drivers attention. Thanks in advance for any links and help that can be provided!

 
I don't know of anything that's an exact fit for your needs, and I suspect that you might have to put something together out of spare parts, but I can think of some places to start looking:

* Amazon. You might find an item by trying different word searches on Amazon.

* Bicycle stores. You might find lightweight lighting systems in bicycle shops. I myself use bike lights on the front of my chair, but I have the dexterity to reach down and switch them on and off. With LED lights, there's all sorts of possibilities now.

* Car accessory stores. If you want a flashing light that works off a 12V battery, then you might find something in a car accessory store, but you might need a sort of truck accessory store to find warning lights.

* Camping/outdoor stores. The only other place I can think of that might use battery power are camping or outdoor activities.
