Am I over-training by strength training or running on alternate days? I'm trying to learn the skill of getting up from the floor to my (very tall) chair, so I'm doing chair dips and female position push ups every other day. But if I don't do *something* work out-ish every day, I usually end up skipping several days. So I've taken to training for a 5k on my "off" days... Except, for me this isn't an Arm day/Leg day pattern, it's an Arm day/Arm day pattern. Am I over doing this? Are there more efficient patterns out there?
