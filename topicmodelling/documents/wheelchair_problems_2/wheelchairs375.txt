Looking for a special edition wheelchair... In 2013, My Father-in-law lost a special edition wheelchair that was, well, special to him.  
The Black Forest Fire in 2013 claimed so much, including his wheelchair, among other personal belongings.  Most things are able to be replaced, but this wheelchair, according to my wife, was a special edition.  

He used to zip around various stores at up to 15 MPH and make most of us laugh at his antics.  

It was your typical electric wheelchair - pneumatics to raise/lower the seat, a pathetic horn, etc.  The problem is, the chair was a mesh back like so many popular office chairs, and the reason he loved it so much.  

We have been unable to find a suitable replacement since then.  I once uploaded a photo to IMGUR to showcase him and his, at the time, deaf boxer, as one of my favorite photos.  It still is, but the wheelchair is sadly gone for all time.  

Does anyone know who the company was, or if there are any alternatives out there?  We have insurance money we can spend on purchasing a new one - I'm all ears if anyone has any ideas or leads on a similar or replacement unit - even by the original manufacturer.

Anyone have any leads?   Permobil used to sell various seats that you could put on their bases. One was the Aeron, which was styled after the Aeron office chair.

I don't think a Permobil can go 15 mph.  I can't personally help you ID this chair, but it might be worth posting over in the [CareCure equipment forums](http://sci.rutgers.edu/forum/forumdisplay.php?4-Equipment). They're a helpful bunch, and a lot more active than this subreddit!

That said, the seat totally looks like an Aeron office chair, and quick Googling gave me [some similar chairs](https://www.google.com/search?q=aeron+power+wheelchair&biw=1591&bih=957&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk3ZP6vojKAhVN9mMKHc43DBEQ_AUIBigA) Your third picture shows a Permobil logo. Try contacting them.  Sorry for the late response, thanks all for your help.  I'll take it from here.   Sorry for the necro, but it looks like it's a [Permobil C500 Aeron](http://www.usatechguide.org/itemreview.php?itemid=1263)  [^(**Mouseover** or **click** to view the metric conversion for this comment)](http://fiddle.jshell.net/ConvertsToMetric/xhk4y5h5/show/light/?15%20mph%20=%2024.1%20km/h%0A "15 mph = 24.1 km/h
