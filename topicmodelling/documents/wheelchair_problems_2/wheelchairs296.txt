My grandmother is 94 and is in need of an electric-wheelchair or scooter. As stated in the title, my grandmother has reached an advanced age and I would like to get her a motorized (non-manual) scooter or wheelchair for her.

But to be honest, I can't find really centralized information, or what I should even be looking for. And she doesn't particularly either, other than she has difficulty walking at all.

If anyone could point me in the right direction, or has advice, or pointers to give, I would be grateful.

What is it you looked for in your electric wheelchair and why?
What problems do you face when you use it?

I've never gotten to use anything like one outside of a grocery store- so I am completely ignorant. I appreciate any and all help. Is she on a government health program? She may be eligible, with a doctor’s prescription, for an assistive device.

Elder care facilities often have a program to rent or loan wheelchairs. I’m a mobility tech in Canada. 

I can help you a little from my experience if needed. 

The first thing I would ask is if she has the strength to steer a scooter. I power wheelchair is easier to drive as it doesn’t take a lot of muscle. Having said that, if she doesn’t have the coordination to be able to steer a power wheelchair it can be troublesome. Does that make sense? 

If you’re looking scooters there are two main styles. A four wheel and a three wheel. 

Three wheel scooters are great for small areas where turning radius is an issue. With that comes the first major drawback-they’re tippy! Our store doesn’t stock three wheelers because of that, special request only.

Four wheel scooters are safer as they’re not nearly as tippy. But it takes a little more strength and it has a larger turning radius.

A mid wheel consumer power chair (pride jazzy, shopprider p424) is going to have the best turning radius as the drive wheels are in the Center. They’re programmable so a tech can reduce the speed, turning speeds, and throw of the joystick. Basically programming the drive to fit the users needs. 

Like others have said, I would suggest she go to a store and try some different things. Spend some time with the sales person and make sure she’s comfortable with what ever she chooses. 

If you have further questions don’t hesitate to reply here or pm me. I’ll do my best to get you the information you need. 
 The best option for her would probably be a mobility scooter, and your budget should more than cover the cost of buying one privately. You need to be searching for a mobility store that has a showroom. They will help Grandma find what fits her needs perfectly, and she will be able to try them out and see what she likes.

Good luck! Wheelchair 4 I can get that  Well, we aren't worried about acquiring one for her. If I cannot afford even the pricier models my family is willing to chip in up to 20,000$ for what's out there.

But obviously higher cost doesn't mean quality. It just means higher cost.

I do not believe she is on a government health program- honestly she's doing great for her age also, and has a private doctor. I will ask, however.

The issue is she has been living with my father for the last 9 years in Hungary (they're Californian and she's from Illinois) so she just got back last week so she could be closer to her other son. My father is hitting his 70s, so it is difficult for them to take care of her as she needs.

And I'm in the middle east working lol, and life would be even harder here. Best option is for her to be a few miles from my uncle and her son, but we'd also like her to have the scooter/wheelchair.
 Wow awesome. I believe she has the strength in her arms. But then again, when she swims I have to help her out, which I'm fine with, but I think telling of her ability. I figure a joystick is best.

I'd say she falls under 250 lbs, I think (she's rotundish) so I was thinking maybe the best option is one of those travel scooters you can assemble or disassemble. What are your thoughts?

Also can you tell me more about the programmable ones? I have never heard of that.

Now I am curious what different kinds are out there, and what features. As far as I know its just scooters, wheelchairs, golf carts, and those heavy-duty 3 and 4 wheel etc.

Is there centralized information you know of? Or your company offers?


 Do most stores have showrooms? I didn't even realize this was a thing. Are there any brand stores you might recommend? Good luck, I’m following you. Do you live near a medical school?  They may have a wheelchair clinic which will do accurate measurements and assess needed design etc. Orthopedic drs should also be able to make recommendations. 

Make sure whomever you buy from does thoroughly accurate measurements. A gel cushion will be much more comfortable but it will change her height etc so make sure that is figured into measurements. 

I can’t tell how uncomfortable it is to sit or travel in an improperly sized wheelchair. 
 250.0 lbs ≈ 113.4 kilograms ^(1 pound ≈ 0.45kg)

What do you mean by centralized info? Are you looking for specific product info? Or multiple products? It’s a huge niche industry. Our store has a dozen different brands/models of scooters in stock and the same in power wheelchairs. And those are just the ones that sell most often. 

Make a list of questions you have. Do a Search for mobility equipment near you and look through the companies websites. 

There are all kinds of scooters, from travel(folding/tear down) to 4x4 off road type scooters. Many do, unfortunately I’m in the U.K. so my recommendations wouldn’t be much use I’m afraid. If you don’t mind sharing Grandmas general location I can look some up for you? Thank you ^^.  Yeah! something like that lol. Indiana, Indianapolis :D. Your best bet looks like [Access Mobility](https://www.accessmobility.com/) it’s got a huge showroom with what looks like a big range, they offer advice and try outs, and the reviews all look good. 

There’s a place called [Lifestyle Scooters](http://lifestylescooters.com/contact.php) though they for some reason have virtually no information about them online, so I couldn’t tell you what they have.

There are a bunch of other places, but mostly they appear focused on lifts/adaptations, or don’t appear to have the facilities to try out the scooters.

The other alternative would be rental, there are a few places in Indy that do scooter rentals, though that would probably work out much more expensive on a long term basis.

Access Mobility looks really promising though, the setup is very much like my local mobility showroom, and the reviews seem to suggest it’s legit. Thank you so much. Finding centralized information is hard, which seems weird to me.
So far the best centralized information I can find has been via https://www.spinlife.com/spinlifeuniversity/Scooters/Anatomy_of_a_Scooter.cfm


What are your thoughts concerning them?
 I can’t access their website unfortunately (presumably they haven’t agreed to the recent law change regarding data here in the U.K, it’s irritatingly common!), so I couldn’t say. 

Honestly, I’d just go down there and try out a few scooters, and see what she likes. You can note down the favourites and then look up some reviews before making a decision?
