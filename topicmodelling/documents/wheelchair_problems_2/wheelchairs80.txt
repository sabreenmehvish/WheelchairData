Smartdrive powers regular wheelchair  Few weeks ago, someone shared a video showing the Firefly, a powered wheel that attach to the front of the wheelchair. My wife is lucky to have this device called Smartdrive. It is very simple. Its attached at the bottom and senses the pushes keeping up the speed steady. It allows steering normally.
Here is a video that I finally found and my wife gave me the thumbs up to share. May I ask how much this cost you? I know the website says you can go through insurance but my insurance sucks so it probably won't cover it. Do you have any idea how much it would be out of pocket?

ETA: finally found the price. $6k is steep, almost as much as an electric chair outright  I have one and love it!! So much freedom. It is expensive. If it wasn't for the insurance we wouldn't get it. Hopefully the technology improves and gets cheaper to make it more accesible.
