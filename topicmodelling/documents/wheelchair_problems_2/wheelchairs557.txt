First wheelchair questions I just received my first manual wheelchair... I use a walker most of the time, along with crutches, but I figured a wheelchair would open more doors with stable independence and being able to use my hands more. So I got a prescription from my doctor, and I got my chair in 2 days....

Unfortunately my chair is too heavy to lift in my truck, but aside from that it's usable... I got the chair through Medicare B (my only insurance), and I'm wondering if I have any recourse?

Should I/Can return it?
Or 
Should I get a ramp for my truck?

Any ideas or advice would be helpful. 2 days for a Medicare chair? I am going to call fraud on your providers part. Medicare orders never get done that fast. They likely gave you a cheap K0001 chair so they don't have to do all of the extensive paperwork involved. 

Go back to your provider and tell them to do it right. You can get a better and lighter chair. If you qualify that is. If they give you any problems, feel free to PM me and I will try to help. Just be ready to take 3-6 months to get all the appointments and paperwork done and delivery scheduled.  I would call the vendor, and see if it could be exchanged for a lighter chair. Folding and adustibility adds weight to a wheelchair. So, the ultra-light chairs are usually not foldable. The really light weight chairs are rigid with aluminum or titanium frames.  Some rigid wheelchair can weigh between 12-20 pounds with wheels, and under 10 lbs without. So, usually you do not need a ramp for a manual wheelchair. I am not sure if medicare will let you go that way, tell them that you are not able to get your wheelchair in your truck and see if you can get some kind of ultra-light weight wheelchair that you can pick up more easily.

The wheelchair in this video is expensive, probably around $2,000. You may not need something like this, but have a look at how light and easy it can be. This girl can transfer her manual wheelchair into her car very easily.

Other than that, they do have lifts for pick up trucks that lift your chair into the back of the truck for you, but I think they might be pretty expensive.  Unfortunately, Medicare will only pay for a chair for use in the home. Loading it in your truck is not something they will consider a lighter chair for. You have to need  features of the ultra-light wheelchair in the home for Medicare to cover it. 

I know this sounds ridiculous, it's been this way for years. Yeah, I'll give them a call tomorrow. I have a feeling they won't, but it's worth a shot.

Post feedback in /r/ToMetric") Unfortunately not, if I could get the wheels off, I'd probably be okay...as for the lifts, I was looking at some ramps I might be able to use, but that's not ideal either. There is a good chance if it's an off the shelf item they haven't completed the paperwork, so hopefully it will be that easy. If they will cover a custom chair, they come in as low as 10 pounds. Not sure what they will cover though. Yeah it's definitely off the shelf, I'll give them a call tomorrow.. Hopefully o can get something lighter or more foldable/mobile
