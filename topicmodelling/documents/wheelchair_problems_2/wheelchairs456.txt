Contest To Win Rayne Shield About five months ago, I asked in this subreddit about[ rain  and wet legs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wheelchairs/comments/78gou5/rain_and_wet_legs/). The feedback I got was extremely helpful and encouraged me to go further. I put together a team of wheelchair users \(many of which came from here and the disability subreddit\) and together we developed "Rayne Shield". Rayne Shield will be launched on 6 August, just in time for Autumn. 

Now we are announcing a contest to win a free Rayne Shield. If you want to participate, all you have to do is share our [Rain Contest](https://www.facebook.com/rehadesign/photos/a.10153049259393567.1073741830.155905503566/10156197860503567/?type=3&theater) on your FaceBook page.  You might want to take the contest too and see how much you know about rain.
