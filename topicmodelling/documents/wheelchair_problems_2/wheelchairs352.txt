Roadside assistance for wheelchair users I use a power chair and am fortunate enough to have a van ramp. As my van gets older I am becoming more concerned about the possibility of it breaking down leaving me stranded on the highway. I have AAA which would tow my van, but that still leaves me in my chair stuck on the road.

After doing some research I found several roadside assistance companies that will provide a ride in a wheelchair van, a wheelchair technician, a van lift/ramp technician, as well as towing, tire changing, jumpstarting service. Have any of you ever used one of these services? If so, would you recommend them? I will be happy to pay the $150 per year if I can count on them to come through if/when I need them.

Here are the three services I found:
