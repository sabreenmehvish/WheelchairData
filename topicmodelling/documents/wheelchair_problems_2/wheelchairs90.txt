Trying something new for folks in wheelchairs My dad has MS and for years we've had a hard time finding accessible hotel rooms that werent way too expensive.

When we would find a good one, it was probably gone before we even had a chance to reserve it.

That helped me realize that there is probably a huge need out there for accessible accommodations across the community.

So, a few friends are helping me build an Airbnb style matching service to connect folks with wheelchairs to people who have space in their accessible homes.

We're still getting it started but we wanted to get the word out here first. I'm not asking for money (we cant receive it yet even if we wanted it) but I would LOVE your thoughts and feedback on the idea.
If you're feeling motivated, check out our landing page and sign up to be alerted for when we finally do launch.

Thanks, everyone!
