Help finding a WAV company that could donate a free trip in Chicago. I work for a non-profit called One Dream that helps make dreams come true for low-income Chicagoland seniors. We're taking a woman named Diana to the Opera on 3/12. [Here's her story](https://oneseniordream.org/send-diana-opera/).

Does anyone know of a wheelchair accessible transportation company that might donate a ride? Thanks! Talk to Uber. I think they're looking for any sort of good PR relating to their WAV efforts. Uber actually gave us some free ride coupons right away. Very nice about it. Unfortunately, I don't think there's any way to reserve a ride. Seems like Uber is pretty hit or miss about whether a WAV is available when you need it.

SCR Medical has offered to give us a ride though! We'll us the Uber ones in the future for a senior who doesn't need a WAV. 

Thanks for the reply!
