Geek my chair Getting my Permobil chair on Fri which is too late to geek it out for Heroescon this weekend, but my kids are saying that I definitely need to do something to the chair for cons (we go to all of the ones in our area & the next one is in July). I've seen a really cool steampunk one, but that looks like it took serious know-how & money, neither of which I have. Anyone have simple ideas that would look great? you can find some pieces of wood or styrofoam, paint them black/silver, and play off of the throne on GoT I'm a proponent of lighting, for both safety and looks! Simple under the seat LEDs are easy and cheap to set up and can match most chair accent colors. You can get super creative with it beyond that, depending on your comfort with electronics and/or simple programming! Nice work on the permobil! What model? What joystick? Did you get lights? If you need, permobil has a mud n snow tire (pneumatic only) and some aggressive casters. 

I like the idea of a slip on cardboard deal. Make it a transformer or a chariot or something ridiculous!

Iâ€™ve been waiting for a customer to paint the shrouds. I think if you were talented enough you could steam punk the shit out of one. Fake rivets and rust.
