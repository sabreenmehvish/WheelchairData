A New Mobility Reviews Community For the last few months, I have been working on a small team to develop what we're hoping will be a leader in mobility reviews, [Crytico](http://crytico.com).

For a brief history, [Crytico](http://crytico.com) was founded by the owner of the IMED Mobility Sales company in order to create a community powered by your opinions with all of your mobility products.

After generating content for a few months, I decided it was time to share it with Reddit and the community of internet folks who use wheelchairs. I could have made a new profile for [Crytico](http://crytico.com), but decided that I would post from my personal profile to ensure you that we're not just spamming and we do care about your thoughts. I'd love to hear what you think about our website thus far. We are tentatively leaving our pilot phase on the first of the year, and have a lot of new things to launch. Feel free to poke around.

If anything is missing, I am the guy who uploads all of the content, we can absolutely work on it!
