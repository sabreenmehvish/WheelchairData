Loose / Broken spoke on a Tilite ZRA manual chair. Help? If anyone here can help, I would be most appreciative.

I realized this morning, that one of the spokes on my wheelchair seems to be popped out of the slot nearest to the tire.

Can I simply remove one spoke without damaging the chair?  Does anyone know if there is a way to re-anchor the spoke temporarily?

[This is the chair I'm talking about](http://www.tilite.com/chairs_zra.php#5).

EDIT: It seems that the metal cuff into which the spoke threads just slipped inside the wheel housing.  I have attempted to screw it back in, but it is barely holding. The fewer spokes you have, the riskier it is to roll without one. If you're running the Spinergy LX with only 12 spokes, it is riskier. If you have 36 metal spokes, it's no big deal to roll around for a few days. Either way, take your wheels to a bike shop with a good wheel guy to get them fixed.  I've got the 36-spoke wheel.  I think I may have anchored the spoke temporarily (I was able to screw the spoke back into the nipple with needle-nosed pliers), but I am definitely taking it to my local bike shop when I can.

THANKS!
