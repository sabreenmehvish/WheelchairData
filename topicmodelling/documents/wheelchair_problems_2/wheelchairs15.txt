I'm crowdfunding my first pants design with better pockets for people in wheelchairs (feedback welcome!)  YES!!!!!!!  I actually have made my own pants with a pocket design just like this. The only thing I'd suggest is maybe a couple of pictures of somebody in a chair wearing them. Just so you can see how they lay and how far they drop when there is items in them.  I just gotta know why they are charging so much.  It doesn't seem like good business sense.   That's really cool! I knew I couldn't have been the only one! I think if you scroll down on the page you'll see some photos of the model sitting down in them. Betabrand handled all the photos. If this design does well, I'm really looking forward to moving forward with other types of pants (which I actually prototyped first). Aww, I see those now. It's a great design. There's. Itching worse than trying to dig stuff out of your pockets, and dropping them.
