Anti-Movement Wheelchair? I'm hoping someone here will be able to provide some help/advice.  When visiting a hospital today, I came upon a wheelchair that had a cool/helpful feature: it wouldn't move unless the person pushing the wheelchair squeezed/depressed the handles--kind of like luggage carts in some airports.

I didn't think to take the name but I think this would help keep my mom safer when we were traveling.

Any ideas about names of manufacturers (or even what I'd call the system, googling got me nothing) would be helpful.  Kaiser in in So Cal has those. No idea what they are called but the certainly exist. They are more annoying to use.
 Can your mom use the brakes? If so brake handle extensions might be a better idea. I know exactly what your talking about as the hospital I volunteer at has them, but cannot for the life of me find one on google. I always call them squeeze or lawnmower wheelchair, but apparently thats not the official name. Will keep looking. Hey, finally was able to pull up what you were looking for, sorry ot took so long but didn't have a shift at the hospital until today.

The brand we have here is Staxi, and apparently are called Transport chairs. Link: http://www.staxi.com/ thanks for the help :) She can't, but I'll look into them anyway:) thanks!  thanks so much!
