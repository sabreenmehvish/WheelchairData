Was researching on smart controllers for wheelchairs, what are your thoughts on this Reddit?  I'm a little confused by it, maybe because it uses symbols more than words and doesn't show a person so I'm uncertain which body parts are interacting with the tech. My husband drives his chair with a tiny joystick he moves with his lower lip, and uses his computer with a sip-and-puff mouse plus Naturally Speaking. It looks like these all require hand or head movement, so he couldn't use them. But I may be wrong?
