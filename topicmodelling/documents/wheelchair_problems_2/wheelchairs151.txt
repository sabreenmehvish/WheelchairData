I made a video on the materials of a modern wheelchair.  Nice vid, accurate info. Always cool to see our chairs out in the wild. 5 years, sounds like you're about ready to upgrade to a TR3.  Thanks! Yeah, i'm in the process of getting a ZR.  Very cool. It'll be a different ride than the TR you're currently in, but I'm sure you'll love it. Make sure you tell your ATP or dealer to make sure to tell TiLite to match it as close as possible to your current serial number. Chair dimensions can vary slightly between model types because of the welds required and manufacturing process.  Thanks for the info. I might end up getting the newer TR anyway, i'm not 100% set on getting the ZR.  why were you thinking ZR over TR? I just think it looks better. It just looks more clean.  True, less bars, but coming from an aero Z i Thought the T's were cool
