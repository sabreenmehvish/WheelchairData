Seated Segway, inexpensive option I can stand and walk only short distances without pain. Rented a wheelchair but found it was heavy and difficult to get into/out of the car trunk.

I ended up designing and building a lightweight seat to add to the smallest Segway (Ninebot MiniPro). I have put complete (no cost) build instructions and drawings on the following site;

[https://www.instructables.com/howto/flax101/](https://www.instructables.com/howto/flax101/)

There are elaborate seat additions on the market for Segways, however, they are expensive. The one I built is of plywood; the only modification to the Segway MiniPro is replacing part of the steering handle with an extension. This device is only applicable to those who can stand and walk a bit.

It is very easy (10 minutes) to learn to ride, as the Segway does all the balancing, but it is experimental, and one needs to be careful around obstructions that can block the wheels (this is explained in the instructions). 

The MiniPro is about $500, which is a very good price given that it has most of the features of the larger Segways that cost $6000.  I do not use it inside my house, but outside and in public buildings it is great. The battery lasts all day without issue. In two years its odometer hit 200 miles.

Goes and stops by leaning, very intuitive. The handle is for steering, and the device can turn in its own width, as in an elevator. Construction is simple, but does require a modicum of woodworking skill. 

I am happy to address comments and questions, however, if you decide to build one I would rather answer construction questions on the Instructables site.

I made a handlebar system for it.  I found it to be MUCH less stable than my i2s.  I ended up giving it to my sister's kids as it was just too squirrely for me (partially paralyzed legs.)  The price, light weight, and nearly-silent operation were awesome, though. Your chair looks awesome, and I'd love to try it! Would it be easy to get on and off for a wheelchair user? Is there a stand or anything like that so you can sit on it while it's powered down?

&#x200B;

I use a chair made by Sui Generis Seat and it's life changing; I'm high up, it's reactive and comfortable, intuitive to ride (it feels like I'm moving by willpower alone a lot of the time) and great fun. I have so many people come up to me each day to ask about it and I'm treated differently in it compared to my manual wheelchair (I actually exist, for a start!). I get a lot of people asking if it's a wheelchair or if I'm just using it for fun!

&#x200B;

I looked into making something myself but I needed a sturdier option which I could use all day every day and I'm not too good at making things by hand. Can I ask if it makes any sound? Mine seems quiet when I'm outdoors or anywhere people are talking but in a small office where people are quietly working or in an elevator, I'm suddenly aware of a high pitched noise the chair makes all the time.

&#x200B;

You're right that you need to take care though, if a wheel gets caught or loses traction then it can be unpredictable and I've had a few 'rodeo' moments that weren't too fun, plus the Segway is four horsepower so it can do some damage if it wants to...

&#x200B;

I think Segway chairs are a great option for people who want to get out and have fun and perhaps be a little reckless in the countryside / offroad / forests / ploughed fields etc as well as their office, and don't have delicate bones so that they're okay with perhaps falling off a couple of times per year when they try something stupid (I only bought mine so I could keep on being stupid, I really missed it!).

&#x200B;

I need mine all the time, though I try to balance it with manual chair use too so that I keep healthy. I've done well over 800 miles (1287Km) this year and it's still going strong. I bought the Segway second hand to save money and it had already done 2,000 miles when I bought it and I've had no issues at all. 

&#x200B;

Sui Generis make the perfect chairs in terms of my needs and are really cheap: Genny Motion were the company I saw first, but they were over £10,000 more expensive and there are no adjustments they can make to it whatsoever, so it would have been really painful for me to use. I was really put off by the way the staff were treated too; only managers were allowed to talk to the designer when he was in the UK, workers and sales staff weren't allowed to approach or speak to him at all and he'd blank them if they tried.

&#x200B;

Sui Generis are in Greece and ship worldwide (I'm in England if you hadn't guessed). I found a company in England (they work in Africa too, I think they started there) called SegFree who are awesome and genuinely cared about my needs too - I think their chairs are better suited to users who have more mobility issues than I do (my arms are strong and I can move my upper body fine - no bone or spine problems / issues above my waist).

&#x200B;

Great to see the idea being used by more people! Thanks for the comments, and yes, people are more likely to chat, or ask about it than if one is in a wheelchair. Some ask if it is for fun or a necessity. I could say both. Museum guards go crazy and want one.

As for getting on/off, one needs to have ability to stand/walk, and some agility to be safe with this. Each wheel is half horsepower, and if one wheel hits an obstruction, the other wheel wants to go forward quickly. You have to be very careful around any curbs or chair legs and the like.

I have not designed a stand for this, though it would not be that tough to add something. Blumil makes a seat for the MiniPro, and it has supports for when stopped. They seem to suggest theirs works for those without leg control or strength. Also, Sharper Image makes a device based on a hoverboard, but it uses a unicycle seat so I am not confident it would be comfortable for any length of time (I think it is $800).

You asked about noise, it is very quiet. 800.0 miles ≈ 1,287.5 kilometres ^(1 mile = 1.6km)
