Looking to share a new device with musicians in wheelchairs Looking for individuals with physical handicaps that are musicians.  I am helping a friend with a device he developed that replaces the sip-and-puff.  I'll post a video of the demo he did last week as soon as I get the OK.  Their are music, gaming, and home automation integration potential, and more once its open sourced. He wants to give a few devices to people around the world to test it out.  He did it to play double bass drums.  Sorry I can't share more about the technology here (respecting my friends wishes to keep it stealthy).  I use a mouth activated sustain pedal when I play keyboard. T5 SCI. 
 I play drums, contact me, I don't know much about this device, but I'd love to talk about it and see if it will help my life.  Very cool, this is similar in that it is mouth controlled.  The keyboard effects could be really cool for modulation, vibrato, etc.   Leo designed it because he got some enjoyment, but its got the potential to be very helpful and versatile to individual needs.  As a drummer, I think you would really like this once you see it.  He started with drums.
