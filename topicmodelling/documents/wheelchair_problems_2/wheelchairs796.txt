NEW PRODUCT FOR WHEELCHAIRS  TBH, advertising a new product without some sort of picture or a better idea of what you are designing is probably too early.  I am not advertising the product as such, I am informing people of the product and allowing those who would be interested in it to follow the process. 
I am also trying to build a network of people who are interested in collaborating to open doors for each other.
