Replacement wheels? Hello everyone,

One of the wheels on my manual wheelchair has completely blushed out and made using my chair impossible. I was gifted the chair by another wonderful user so I'm not sure where the original wheels came from. Does anyone know where to go to et a replacement wheel?

My chair is a k√ºschall fusion If that matters  You might want to try ebay, had some success getting replacement wheels from there.  what size are your wheels? there should be numbers listed on the tires {eg. 24-1-3/8 or 24-540} find out what your size is and we can help you get replacements...quality will depend on how much you are willing to spend
