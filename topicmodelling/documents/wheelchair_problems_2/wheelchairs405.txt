I have an Invacare FDX. Where is a place where I can find hacks/mods for it? No es bueno. There are a few things I would like to do. I am a computer guy, and I can have a few  of my engineer friends help me with anything. Do you have the Mk6i electronics that are configurable via the SD slot in the front of the display? Some configuration options can be fiddled with if you have the pro SD card. I believe you can still download it from (http://www.invacare.com/cgi-bin/imhqprd/inv_search/search_editorial_detail.jsp?s=0&cntOID=537148866). This allows you to turn off annoyances (Tilt override,etc) and fine tune gears to your preferences. (Indoor,outdoor,power,etc.) If you have the MK5 electronics, best bet would probably be an old hand programmer via ebay or understanding wheelchair tech. Hope this helps! Thank you! I think I have an old SD card around, I guess I'll just make a pro SD card. The moron company I got the chair from never gave me one.
