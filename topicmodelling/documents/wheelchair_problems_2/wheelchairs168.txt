Some wheelchair skills on tape  This is *awesome.* I've been riding my chair at a local skatepark for years, and between these guys and Aaron Fotheringham (who's toured with Nitro Circus), it really looks like this new sport may be taking off. I need to get one of these chairs. Stoked to see where it'll go!
