Battery issues... Help? I recently received a quantum q6 edge from a very kind soul. It had been working beautifully until Friday, when for the first time, it lost a battery notch. I plugged it in over the weekend (I store it at school. Come in with my manual, transfer to my motorized, at the end of the day transfer back.) It lost another notch despite being plugged in. I've been at school for only a few hours and i'm down to 3 out of 8 notches. What's going on??? How old is the chair. I have a Quantum Q6 Edge myself, and I recently went through battery issues. The is the first chair I've had that needed to have batteries replaced. Which is to say, the manual will tell you that batteries on the Q6 Edge only last about 2 years. And, that has been my experience.

Alternatively, it may be the charger itself. If you do get the battery replaced, make sure that the vendor uses new batteries, and that they replace both.
 It's a few years old, but the original owner used it only 10 times. The battery is new.

That said, I actually was able to fix the charger! A cord was a bit loose. Good! With these chairs charging issues can usually be pinned to either the chargers or battery. Also, wheelchair batteries can still discharge power when not in use. So you *may* want to get a reading on the battery to make sure it is still holding a charge adequately. But then, I'm neurotic.
 Thank you for the additional info! once school is over I'll get it checked. Also, for best performance charge the chair every night!
