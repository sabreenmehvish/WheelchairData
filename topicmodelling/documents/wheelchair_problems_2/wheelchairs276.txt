That didn't hurt at all. Wait, why am I bleeding?  Has anyone ever experienced this? Where you don't think you're hurt and then you are? Yep, very recently - only this week I've injured some of the soft tissue in my leg and so have a pretty bad infection now. Didn't notice it until my shin changed colour. So that'd be very helpful for me :p Maybe I play too hard.
