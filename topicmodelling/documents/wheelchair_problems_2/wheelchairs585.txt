Sure the historic image of a city is important, but more than accessibility?!?  As a history major in University, I'm all for preserving history, but we don't live in the 1800s any more. People in wheelchairs are no longer confined to static lives. If you want to preserve history, go ahead, but do it in a way that doesn't push wheelchair users back to those times.  There needs to be a balance. I'll give a tiny example. Up where we life the curbs are this old beautiful pink granite. I wanted cut outs on the corners, but I did not want them to cut that granite. Luckily the city didn't,, they build an asphalt ramp to the curb. I am sure that some reasonable compromise can be made to put in access that is not glaring and maybe even reasonable looking. And I do accept that the can be places where constructing access destroys something sufficiently valuable that they don't put it in. (As a stupid example I don't demand an accessible ramp to the bottom of the Grand Canyon.)

 as a non-history major, I can't agree more. I suspect they want to preserve businesses and property values.
