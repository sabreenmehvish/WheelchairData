Please Suggest Wheelchair Roll Models On our[ facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/rehadesign), we are running series about Wheelchair Athletes, Artists, Musicians and other talented wheelchair users.  We call them "Roll Models". We usually write a short description and post a few photos. All with their permission and participation.  If you can suggest a few candidates, please let us know. Aaron “wheelz” awesome stunt man! Wheelsnoheels- disability blogger, uwalk_iglide- fashion/ beauty blogger Real late to the party but neroli fairhall has an amazing story. First paraplegic in the Olympics. Won gold medal at commonwealth games. Got it taken off her. Got it back. Fucking amazing chick and a kiwi to boot. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neroli_Fairhall  These are excellent suggestions. We have already posted about Aaron. Not as a "Roll Model" but as one of our celebrities.  In fact, I know him well. I did his first interview just after his backflip. 

I like Wheels No Heels. I have enjoyed Gem's blogs. I don't know her. But I know her blog channel well. I particularly liked her Tex Talk.  It is a good suggestion. We will contact her.

I don't know uwalk\_iglide, Is her name Steph?

But keep in mind, that our "Roll Models" do not have to be famous celebrities. It could be you, your friend, or cousin. Everyone who is doing something that is interesting and motivating could be featured as a "Roll Model".  Awesome! He’s so cool. Oh ok, great! There are definitely more people I could think of then. Gem is lovely, I messaged her for some wheelchair handle advice and she went above and beyond to help :).
