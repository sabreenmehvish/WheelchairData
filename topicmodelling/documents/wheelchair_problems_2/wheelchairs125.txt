Getting my wheelchair stuck in cobblestone downtown?  Excellent video and project. I know it was tough, but I suggest you do it annually and monitor it to see if the situation improves. I wonder if anyone has done this in Tallinn or Vilnius? I suspect the situation is similar. But do you have any information about it?
