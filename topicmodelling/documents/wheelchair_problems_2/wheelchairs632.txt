I am hoping r/wheelchairs might be able to help me identify this gray. r/whatisthis figures out it was probably for a wheelchair but I have not been able to track down this exact one to find out what it fits and how much it is worth. Thanks!  It's a wheelchair table tray, meant to slide over the wheelchair armrests. From the looks of it and the material used, my guess is it was custom made/ "home" made. Probably not worth anything. 

If you donate it to a local Red Cross or similar organization that gives out medical equipment, you may be able to get a tax receipt for $30. To aid mobile users, I'll link small subreddits not yet linked in the comments

About $35 dollars- tops. It was designed to mount on the arm rest but the issue is that you have to find a manual wheelchair user that has the correct width of chair for that type of tray.... and is willing to pay the money.
