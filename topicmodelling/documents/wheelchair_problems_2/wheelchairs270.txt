Alternatives To Joystick For Driving Power Wheelchair I have SMA, and I use a power wheelchair. Over the last year, I have gotten weaker and can no longer operate my wheelchair with the standard joystick. What types of alternative control options are there? I know there are "puff and blow" type options, but I was wondering if other choices were available.  My time to shine! I am on mobile so I hope all the links work. I will be linking mostly to one company just because they sell a variety of different input devices so I don't have to pull up a bunch of different websites. 

I sell wheelchairs so I have to keep up on all the avaliable alternative control devices.

 If you are getting too weak for a standard joystick the next option I would try would be a [mini joystick such as this micro extremity control](http://www.asl-inc.com/products/product_detail.php?prod=17)  as it would be a natural feel and you would not have to learn new controls. With mini joysticks you have to have at least one additional button to handle mode switches or power on/off.  The MEC link above can do mode of you have enough strength to push it in. 

Next option would be a alternate location joystick. Such as one controlled [by a foot](http://switchit-inc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/jscf.jpg) or by [your head](http://www.asl-inc.com/products/product_detail.php?prod=170).  We can even set up a mini joystick to be controlled by your chin, mouth, or tongue. 

Last resort would be a [head array](http://www.asl-inc.com/products/product_detail.php?prod=103)  or as you looked at a [sip n puff system](http://www.asl-inc.com/products/product_detail.php?prod=111). I do these last as they are harder to learn so there is a HUGE amount of frustration for a new user. 

Hopefully I was able to give you some food for thought. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!  could [this](www.ergojoystick.com) work for you? Thanks so much for all of this information! This will be extremely helpful as I look for new controls. Much appreciated! You're welcome. I would also recommend finding your local ATP certified wheelchair provider. They can make arrangements for you to try out the different input devices. If you are still looking you may contact http://www.activecontrols.com/ they are very nice people and will try everything they can to help you.
