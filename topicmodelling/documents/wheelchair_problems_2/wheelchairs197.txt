* Cup Holder: My wife likes the [Ram Mount](https://www.rammount.com/) products for her cup holder.  She uses the cup holder connected to a 6" double socket arm and attached to her chair unitrack with a diamond plate with a 1" ball.

* Power Socket: We basically bought one of [these female outlet plugs](https://smile.amazon.com/Practical-Motorbike-Motorcycle-Tractor-Cigarette/dp/B00E963JFY) but we got it from our local harware store.  Her wheelchair technician hooked it up in about 10 minutes when she was in for a different repair.  Although we did add a 3 amp fuse in the wiring to be sure not to damage her chair (or use anything that draws too much power)...this was almost 10 years ago and it was the first one he did, so wanted to be careful.  Again it was just attached into her unitrack to hold in position.  She then uses various standard car chargers depending on what she is doing.

* LED lights...we haven't done anything permanently (but have had some temporaries that plug into her power socket).  But pretty much any type of LED and switch should be easily wireable into your battery. I have this usb adapter it also has a strong light that acts like a headlight it's on a posable gooseneck so you can move and aim it
