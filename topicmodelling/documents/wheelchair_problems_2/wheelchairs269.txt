Needing a hand on public transport? I put together /r/letsridetogether to help people that would benefit from extra support due to harassment, mobility issues, or other reasons. This seems like a fitting reddit to promote this.

Feel free to post if you are going somewhere, and are in need of help, and/or if you can offer aid of any sort. Let's see if we can help each other out :) This is a great idea. I was harassed so much by bus drivers due to my mobility issue that I ended up paying a stupid amount for driving lessons and my own car. Indeed. There is a lot of people around that just simply need a hand on and off the bus, or from the seat, but don't qualify for assistants. Yet, relying on that there is a helpful stranger around is a bit of a gamble sometimes. And then you have various minorities that is likely to be harassed. From what I can tell, the potential for mutual benefit is rather substantial, if it gets rolling.

Anyway, car or no car, you are welcome if you wish :)
