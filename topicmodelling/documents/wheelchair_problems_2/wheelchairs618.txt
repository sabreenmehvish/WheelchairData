Pressure sores/new seat recommendations... As the title suggests. I need some suggestions for a new cushion. Pressure sores are getting really bad.

*EDIT*

My cushion is the Comfort Company CU-FV-2018 What do you use now? Try a roho. Would probably help to say what you are using now. Four Chamber Gel/Foam Wheelchair Cushion https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009R267IG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_dSR0Bb39JGZA1

I use 4 chamber gel pads for mine and I won’t use anything else now.  I hate to bump my own thread but I figured I’d let the people know I finally got a new cushion. Got hooked up with a new Jay J2 Deep Contour cushion. Hopefully it helps I sit so much higher now but I actually like that because of how low the old cushion was. sorry about that the cushion i'm currently using is: Comfort Company CU-FV-2018 This is a foam cushion. It is probably not the best. Look for an air cell cushion.  One of the most popular is Roho.
