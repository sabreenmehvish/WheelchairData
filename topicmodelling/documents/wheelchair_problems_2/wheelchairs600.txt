Survey for senior design project Hello /r/wheelchairs users. I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Texas Pan American. I am currently in the early stages of my senior design project which aims at improving on a wheelchair propulsion mechanism and would like to get some input from you guys. I made this short [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/QWDGJWF), and would really appreciate if you took the time to answer a few questions. Also if you have anything you think my team and I should know about wheelchairs, please let me know in the comments. Thank you.
edit:Just to clarify, this design is meant to be a manual wheelchair. It seems you're looking for manual-chairs users only.

You really should edit your post to reflect which demographic you're aiming this at . Not everyone in a wheelchair uses a manual and it's not clear at all what you're asking until you view the survey.
