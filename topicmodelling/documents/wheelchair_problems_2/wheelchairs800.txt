Research Project - Participants needed - Relief for wheelchair users with sciatica / lower back pain Hello,

I am a final year student at University studying Product Design. I am conducting research into sciatica/lower back pain and prolonged seated positions, primarily in wheelchair users. Using this research, I aim to design and develop an effective product for wheelchair users to aid pain from prolonged seated positions. 

I am looking for participants who use wheelchairs regularly and experience sciatica or have experienced lower back pain previously. All data collected is anonymous and is done through google forms. I'll post the link down below.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you have any questions or need any more information please let me know. The questionnaire isn't long and will really benefit me.

There is some really strong potential for impactful design changes. What University are you attending?  Yes, it's my dissertation focus. That's really interesting, would you possibly be able to share more information in depth about this? I'm currently studying Product Design at Bournemouth University in the UK.
