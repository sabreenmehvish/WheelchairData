What to do when she says "I have a boyfriend" â€“ my #1 tip [from a dating coach in a wheelchair]  Good conclusion on this article.  I was worried for a second when I was reading the part on normal responses to the line  "I have a boyfriend". I mean, if a women says she has a boyfriend, she is either telling the truth or trying to be nice with a denial; either way I think they are both valid responses. 

Still pretty funny that there is some boob touching going on in the pic despite the fact that the girls husband was near by.   Thank you! It was unintentional :-)
