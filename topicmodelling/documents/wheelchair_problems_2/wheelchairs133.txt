Any wheelchair cover/pad suggestions for someone whose butt sweats a lot? For some reason the wheelchair material makes my butt sweat like crazy. Any recommendations for what to put over it to reduce sweating? I need the most cooling most ventilated pad out there.  Be very careful adding anything on top of your cushion as it may reduce some of the effectiveness of the pressure relief.

If you are close to getting a new cushion, I would recommend looking into the Jay series as most of them have a cover with built in air flow foam. It is almost sponge like but even more open. 

My brothers ride motorcycles and in the summer they use Anti-Monkey Butt powder to dry up the swamp crack and prevent chaffing, I wonder if that would help you out too. I have one thats like Honeycomb pattern, so there are tiny holes in in for aeration. 
 What cushion are you on now?
