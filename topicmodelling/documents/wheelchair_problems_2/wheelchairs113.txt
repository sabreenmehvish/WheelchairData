The importance of a good wheelchair seat cushion! Finally got my Roho air cushion! Yesterday, I finally upgraded from a worn out rather simple contoured foam cushion (Invacare Matrix, I believe), to a Roho Quadtro Select High Profile 4-compartment air cushion.

I spent all yesterday evening and most of this morning sitting on it, and while it hasn't totally eliminated my butt muscle soreness from constant sitting, it has reduced the pain by about 80%.

I also notice that I'm sitting maybe 2 inches higher, which helps with my hip geometry, though it does make getting into and out of the chair harder.

I've had this chair for nearly 6 years, and finally, with the assistance of a wound care facility treating skin breakdown in my nether-regions, plus a referral from my primary care doctor, my insurance covered it.

Now I just need to see if they'll sell the smart-check device, or if I can use some kind of digital PSI gauge, instead of guessing for the required air pressure. 2.0 inches ≈ 5.1 centimetres ^(1 inch = 2.54cm)

Roho’s are great for off loading pressure. 

My suggest for keeping them long term is cleaning. Clean it at least once a month. Take the cover off and clean between the cells. Dirt and debris can get in there and essentially grind away at the cell wall. 

Cleaning it will help the cushion last longer.

If you get cells that stick together DONT pull on it. Instead get some warm soapy water to try and loosen it.

If you can afford it, I’d suggest getting a second one. Odds are inevitable that you’ll get a leak and it’ll have to be repaired. Leaving you with nothing to sit on. 

 Oh my god i LOVE my roho cushion. I cannot explain just how amazing it was to go from a standered foamie to this. Congrats on getting it covered! You don’t determine the amount of air by pressure. The inflation is determined by sliding your, or caregivers hands between your bottom and the cushion. The air should be removed from the cushion until your bottom is approximately 1/2-3/4” above the surface the cushion is sitting on. This ensures maximum immersion into the cushion which reduces the pressure where people get pressure ulcers. Roho has instructions on YouTube you can watch to help with proper use I generally keep a towel or folded sheet on top of my cushion already, as far as keeping them clean, although I will do as you say for the monthly cleaning.

Later, in maybe a few months, I will be able to afford to buy a backup cushion, and that's a good point about needing one.
