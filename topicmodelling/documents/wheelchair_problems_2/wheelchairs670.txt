Walmart manual wheelchairs - how do they compare to brand name ones I'm new to understanding wheelchairs. The local vendor isn't cheap, but they are a good resource when you don't know what's what.

How does something like this $500 Walmart one compare to a Breezy that retails for ~$1500 Canadian?

 With wheelchairs, you really get what you pay for. It also really depends on what the wheelchair is being used for.

If someone will be pushing someone else in the wheelchair, and if it is for occasional use or for a short term solution, the $500 won't be horrible.

However, if the user will be the one pushing themselves in the chair, the walmart one will be very uncomfortable. The breezy one will be better built, probably lighter, and last a LOT longer, particularly if it is used often.  If you're just looking for a transport chair, where someone pushes the chair and occupant, the Walmart one is all you need. Just confirm it holds the weight you need.  Wheelchairs vary based on the user. If the chair is the right size great, if not it will be horrible. A transport chair does not work for self mobility. A heavy chair is more durable but harder to move. Then you care if it can fit in your car.

 The Breezy will far outlast the Walmart one, and will likely be much more comfortable. If you're looking for an every day chair, I would prioritize quality over cost.
