Can anyone recommend a good backpack to put on the back of a TiLite ZRA? For those that haven't seen the back of the TiLite ZRA, the handles are not attached to the chair back: [like this](http://maonarodablog.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Untitled.jpg), so with regular back packs, I have to just put the straps on the handles and hope it doesn't slip off (if I put the backpack on the back of the chair, the straps rub against the wheels since my backrest is quite low). I'm looking for a new backpack (because I'm really sick of my backback falling off), something big enough for a macbook pro and other school stuff, but something either designed for a wheelchair (that wont cost me my arms) or with thin, rope-like straps. Have you looked into [the trabasack](http://www.trabasack.com/) wheelchair bags?

They all have multiple, fully adjustable straps so you can probably find a combination of straps that work for you. It also doubles as a lap tray! One side is a lightweight bean bag lap rest, the other is a solid "tray table" (amazing for when you can't find a table the right height!!)

There are many different ones and they have the customisable straps. They ship worldwide and everyone that buys one raves about it. It can carry a laptop safely as well as all the daily necessities. Or it can just carry anything you need!! 

Definitely contact them as even if they don't have a strap option that suits you currently they're constantly working on product development and use customer feedback to provide new features. 

Best thing I've ever bought :) I use stroller hooks on the back of my son's wheelchair to hang his enteral backpack.  They are usually plain and black so you don't have to worry about them looking babyish.

This is what we are currently using but there are a ton of different styles out there.  If it weren't for these stroller hooks ds would be stuck with an IV pole.  The only problem is the width (ds uses a 12inch wide Tilite YRA).  If you are adult sized then I imagine width issues won't be as much of a headache for you.  You just have to make sure the backpack isn't so wide it will rub against the wheels.
