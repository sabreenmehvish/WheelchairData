The Nerd Cave in Sydney I am a journalism student and am doing a video story about a board game shop/board game venue/Internet cafe place in Sydney called The Nerd Cave. (This is NOT the USA store that sold t-shirts then ripped off consumers.)

Tomorrow the Nerd cave is reopening after moving to a new location in Ashfield that is wheelchair accessible. There doesn't seem to be many wheelchair accessible board game shops in Sydney.

Is anyone interested in doing an interview with me for this story? I'm hoping to find an accessibility expert* and a wheelchair gamer in Sydney.

* = The Nerd Cave consulted with somebody to make sure the place was accessible but I have not been able to contact him.
