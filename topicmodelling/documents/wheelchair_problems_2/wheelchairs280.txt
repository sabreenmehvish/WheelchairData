Help us improve accessible door. Hi,

Iâ€™m Gab, a master student at the University of Michigan. We are doing a research to improve the usability of an entryway for a person with mobility difficulty. If you are currently having mobility difficulty (using wheelchair, etc.), We'd like to ask you to complete an online survey for my research that would help improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.

The survey would take only about 5-10 minutes to complete and your participation will be anonymous. Below is the url to the survey

I apologize if this message disturbs you. Thank you very much.

nopmuk@umich.edu Hi Gab,

The link doesn't seem to work for me. I'm in England though so I'm not sure if that's why?

 Threw in my 2 cents, hope it helps. Whoops, sorry about that. I just fixed it, Thanks for noticing. Awesome. I've submitted my response for you!

Good luck with your research!
