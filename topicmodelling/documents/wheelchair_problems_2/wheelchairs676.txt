Please do this survey! It is quick, simple and NO personal details required! (Wheelchair Users Only)  This survey could really benefit from an explanation of what the heck an "adult wheelchair liner and/or footmuff" is. After clicking through all those questions repeating the phrase but never clarifying, I now have farcical visions of some sort of kinky, velvety *adult* product I can buy for my chair...and my feet, apparently. It is something which has been made, but not very well and certainly not advertised well. They are more known for children and rare for adults.
I am currently designing a product for wheelchair users who love to/would love to go out no matter what the weather.
The liner&/footmuff will be specially designed to suit as many needs and wheelchairs as possible. 
It will be designed to keep users warm, dry and protected from the wind.
It will also have features such as somewhere to keep valuables (eg. Phone, tablet, purse/wallet, keys) safe. ðŸ˜Š


 Yeah, I had to google it to understand what the heck they were talking about. 

I'm an active, Northern Canadian wheelchair user. I just go cold.  Oooooh, cool!
