Any manual wheelchair lever users? -New to Reddit here-

I came across a couple of lever-ish wheelchair accessories, the Wijit and the NuDrive, both designed to make motion a bit easier for users with low arm strength, such as myself. The thing is, they're insanely expensive! So, I wanted to ask around and see if it's a worthwhile investment. Has anyone tried these before? Where to get them second-handed would be a great tip too.

I live in Peru and the architectural barriers are a b*tch for my powered chair so I thought I'd give a 'liftable' wheelchair a try. Frankly, I just want to go clubbing again without worrying about the steps at every club's entrance.

Thanks in advance. I use the wijits sometimes! I feel...pros and cons. On flat ground I'm stoked with them, can get going great. But they only have one gear ratio. So they're actually harder than normal wheels on hills.
