Spina Bifida Hi,

I cam here to promote /r/spinabifida as many of those afflicted with spina bifida are in wheelchairs so I thought there might be a few of those with the same disability that would be interested in joining us. Our community is small but we are hoping to grow it.  thanks for coming over. Took us three years to get to 200. We do not publicize much. Just sharing good links. We have users, helpers of wheelchair users and industry professionals here so readers get great advice. 
All the best. Yea, it actually took me quite a bit to find some groups for disabled people.  I had to start randomly typing in things I thought there might be groups for.
