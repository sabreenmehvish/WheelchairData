im searching for a wheelchair with foldable arms there is on the market something like that ? This advice assumes you're talking about a manual wheelchair. Basically, it depends what you mean by foldable. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/GFHjSn9.png) a list of possible armrest options from TiLite, a high-end wheelchair manufacturer. Armrests can be flipped back, removed, or swung away to the back of the chair. On a low-end wheelchair, the option will usually be flip-back desk arms or removable desk arms.

A couple things to to keep in mind: 

1) Large armrests interfere with ergonomic pushing of a manual chair. You tend to end up with elbows farther out than they should be when pushing so you don't hit the armrests. Even if armrests are up in a folding position, you can't bring your arm all the way back for a full push, making each push less efficient and increasing potential fatigue and joint wear-and-tear. If this chair is for someone who will be self-propelling, consider removable armrests rather than fold/swingaway ones. People without trunk control often rely on armrests, but I know many quads who are successful without them as well, so the user might opt for armrests now and get rid of them later.

2) Armrests are only one, relatively minor, factor in selecting a wheelchair: elements like weight and fit are critical to a comfortable, ergonomic wheelchair. It is often worthwhile to select the model or type of wheelchair you're interested in, then figure out whether there's a version or option for folding armrests.

Good luck!
