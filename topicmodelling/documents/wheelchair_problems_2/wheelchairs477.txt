We want your opinion on the availability of accessibility information on Google Maps! Hi there! I'm working with a group of students at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information in Toronto, Canada. 
	
(more about who we are here and what we do here: https://ischool.utoronto.ca/). 

We are taking a research methods course, and we are interested in how accessibility information is used on Google Maps and Google Local Guides users' contributions of accessibility information to Google Maps. 

We are currently looking for Google Maps users who rely on the accessibility information in Google Maps, either for themselves or for others, and for Google Local Guides at level 3 and above who make contributions about places to participate in surveys, which will help us in our research. 

If this is something you'd be interested in participating in, links to our survey are below:
