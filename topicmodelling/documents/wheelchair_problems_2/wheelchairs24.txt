Are there any good websites or resources for Wheelchair accessories? (desk surface, basket, cup holder, etc) I have only had my wheelchair for a few days.  I have had Neuropathy for many months and have been mostly confined to a bed for a while.  Finally got help from a friend in getting a wheelchair (couldn't afford it on my own, and insurance was gonna take 4 months and only cover 50%) and it is so wonderful to have some freedom again.  I would like to be able to customize it.  I would like to be able to add a basket for when I go shopping, a flat surface for writing and other tasks, and a cup holder for (well that is self explanatory).  I have been hunting on the internet and have struck out.  It is probably right under my nose and I'm just missing it because I am so tired from building up the muscles to push the thing.  (Seriously, I have never been this sore and tired in my entire life, but am happy as it is giving me freedom, exercise, and something else I'm too tired to think of).  Any help would be awesome.  ...Also, are there any good sources for tips and tricks for newbie's using a wheelchair.  It seems easy until you are in one.  Took me longer than I care to admit to be able to get positioned so I could put the cream cheese back in the door of the refrigerator (It's a tight fit between the fridge, counter, and table).  Anyway, cheers, and Happy Holidays. The thing you want is probably out there: the challenge is connecting the maker and the enduser in such a tiny market.

* The [Diest Company](http://diestco.com/index.php/products) has been making & selling canopies, cupholders, and more for two decades.
* The national advocacy group **United Spinal** focuses on folks with spinal cord injuries, but their local chapters often welcome *all* wheelchair users: [find the chapter near you][http://www.spinalcord.org/chapters/directory). United Spinal also publishes a bimonthly magazine you can get for free, full of ads from companies large and small looking to sell stuff just to you. [New Mobility](http://newmobility.com/)'s site gives you a taste.
* This "Add a lap" tray is a nifty design from [Symmetric Designs](http://www.symmetric-designs.com/ada-home.html)
* Free peer counseling (working with another wheeler on developing your handling skills) is one of the primary functions of "Independent Living Centers." They're all over the U.S. [Find one near you](http://www.ilru.org/projects/cil-net/cil-center-and-association-directory)
* I tried a [Tabasack](http://trabasack.com/), a combination lap desk bottom and briefcase top. Beautifully made, but not right for my generous waist. Following that example though ...
* I've found the best lap tray is a thin briefcase/satchel/messenger bag. I wrap the shoulder strap around my waist and rest the case flat on my lap. It not only provides a surface for my notebooks and meals, but it keeps my important stuff ready to hand

 My wife and I really like the [Ram Mount](http://rammount.com/)  products for cup holders.  They have many base mounting and adjustable arm options to make for the perfect fit..but kind of pricey.  The X-Grip phone holder is also pretty nice.

 Try sportaid.com they sell some interesting things. I second the sport aid recommendation, that's a great site. A ton of accessories are available on Amazon and eBay for far cheaper, and send or new items are often on Craigslist for cheap. so if you know a particular model you can search it on those sites to see if you can get it cheaper there. If you could post the model or a pic of your chair I  can recommend adaptations that work with it. Wheelchair dealers can be a huge help too.

 I also like [wheelchair gear](http://www.wheelchairgear.com) which is a great site for backpacks and small accessories, they sell a cub holder I like that is easy to set up and works with more chairs than the standard bike bottle holder.

If you have a rigid frame chair, one of my favourite things is the under seat catch-all: http://www.sportaid.com/wallaby-down-under-catch-all-bags.html

My #1 fave accessory is the "forklift" - the wheelchair luggage carrier that folds against the frame of your chair when not in use. http://www.sportaid.com/luggage-carrier.html these two fold out arms combined with a grocery basket are super useful for grocery shopping.

 Also suggest you check out spinalpedia: https://spinalpedia.com for lots of great how-Tos from other wheelchair users.

You might also have a [Tetra Society](http://www.tetrasociety.org) chapter In your area - this is a non profit group of retired and volunteer engineers who create bespoke solutions for people with disabilities. Their site also has a database of adaptations they've created with pictures.

 Go to the wheelchair makers website. A lot of them are special fit attachments. 
Spin life is a site I've used to find needed items, but again you want to make sure it fits your chair. Do you have a pt (physical therapist) or ot (occupational therapist)? They usually have good resources of where to look. 
My insurance covered my electric and the company I bought it through is really helpful so I know I can call them with any wants. 
Good luck I hope you find something perfect. 
Another obscure suggestion, my cousin is big into biking and he suggested if I visualize something that can help to go see a high end bike shop as they maybe able to make it. He felt they would be so excited to design something they would help for free or their cost of material. 
Welcome to the wheelie life.  I've got you, fam:

First, Mary Allison is fabulous. She's a great athlete and has a high level injury. She's easy to watch and listen to. I just watched her video about getting up from the floor and it helped so much. Here is a link to their best videos:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwMObYmlSHaPLVm1ezSoYufBNu9COWz4x

Second: sportaid.com has so many useful things and their site is decent. They take insurance and prescriptions. Great customer service and some of the best gloves for the money.

Third: if you're needing any toileting supplies http://www.jandrmedical.com/ are freaking great. Again, great customer service, they are small enough to remember you but big enough to get all the good stuff. They take prescriptions and insurance. They're family owned in Houston. I live those girls, they remember me and aren't afraid to chuckle along with my silliness. They'll also work with you on a payment schedule if you need it.

I can't help in the wheelchair front as I used a locally owned family business to help get my TiLite TR.

Best of luck and feel free to ask me any questions. I'm not modest nor do I offend easily.  Sounds like you're making some great decisions for your health! Keep up the great work. Take as little elevators as you can, they are the worst part of being a wheelie I swear. No one realizes my eyes are at their ass or crotch level and cram themselves in like sardines it's the worst. Or when there's able bodied people waiting for an elevator and they all crowd in front of me, really where is common curtesy and oh look there's even an escalator a few stores down! Also viewing platform rails are always right at our eye line so that beautiful view we want to see if always going to have a fat metal bar right through it. Otherwise it's amazing the tools we have to remain independent and function in society. 
Wait forgot one broken handicapped door buttons lol. Anyways you'll learn the ropes. Keep making great decisions for you and ignore the naysayers.  Hi just saw this post and wanted to let you know about my friend  who has designed and made a series of products that I think do exactly what you are looking for, here is a link to youtube site 

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC76Zgl2SDBjU-p0onEOHvXg?app=desktop 
I started a small company with student research at Texas State in Austin that will formally launch in January, we have sold dozens of products locally that have tested well over the last year. We do quasi-custom for those wanting rugged mobility.

 When I first got my chair I was tired so easily too, using muscles that I didn't use on a regular basis. I bought a book from amazon
[The Manual Wheelchair Training Guide](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EPNXTM4/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o03_?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The book was very helpful for me in learning how to just push yourself along without hurting yourself more. 

Also Youtube has some videos that are good that teach you basic things.

Hope you find what you are looking for. i have a lot of things that I collected over the years. I needed them in the beginning and my recovery allows me to do without them. Please pm me what you need and i hope I can get you some of what you need: We can help each other out.

Where are you located? Tbh i look up stroller stuff most of the time. The designs are much nicer and its way less expensive Just started browsing sportaid.com, looks promising.  Thank You.
 The luggage carriers are brilliant. I have something similar on my chair.  Very useful! Thank you.  I went to the makers website, they didn't have what I was looking for, but they had some things available that I hadn't thought of, so I am very glad you told me about that.  I like the Spin Life website, got it bookmarked.  I do not have a PT of OT.  I just moved back home mainly because where I was living in NY (Binghamton Area) was considered one of the worst areas in the country for healthcare.  Very little was done to get me the proper specialists I needed.  So hopefully down here I will get the specialists I need and soon.  And a PT/OT would be awesome.  I would have never thought about the bike shop idea.  I want to be able to have a basket on the back of my chair for my small dog (14lbs Chiweenie) to be able to sit in, so she can go more places with me.  Thank you so much for the advice.  It is greatly appreciated.  Have a look at getting a luggage sling that fits under your chair for your dog. You don't want to have something too heavy on the back as it will affect your balance. I have seen people using the slings for small dogs. It looks very cute!

Edit - see the link for the catch all from u/jocelynlt this is the sort of sling I meant.
