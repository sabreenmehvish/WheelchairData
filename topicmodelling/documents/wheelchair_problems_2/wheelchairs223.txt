Softwheel for Manual Wheelchairs Have any of you guys seen these before? What do you think about them?

 well, they do look nice... but $2k+ for just a set of wheels is insane. 
for that price you could get a badass full suspension [box wheelchair.](https://www.boxwheelchairs.com/daily--daily-suspension-chairs) that's what i'm saving up for. I have a folding manual chair and some suspension would definitely be welcome when I'm out and about. My rough-terrain spare wheels cost about $700, so $2000 for the main wheels isn't that far off for me. In my city there are lots of bumpy pavements, so visually-impaired people know where to cross roads etc. and they're murder to cross at speed. Also, the main pedestrian street is cobbled, so some suspension would reduce the judder.

Perhaps next time I'm buying a chair I'll see how the technology has advanced.
