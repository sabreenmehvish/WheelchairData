I'm getting fitted or my 3rd wheelchair Friday. I'll be getting a Quickie 2HP for the 3rd time  How often do you get a new chair?  
 Hey, if you have found what you like, who am I to judge. I personally, HATED my Quickie QXi. The folding was not worth the extra weight and I prefer my back to be lower. I'm currently in a ZRA, which I love, but I'm not opposed to trying out other wheelchairs when the time comes. This is a fantastic chair. 

My PT implored me not to get a folding wheelchair, but if I listened, I would be pulling 2 wheels off every time I get in and out of my vehicle. That's fine in the sun maybe, but the rain sucks. 

My PT also wanted me to get a small back, so I had more control over my wheels. Again, I don't know what he was thinking. I have a fully adjustable back with multiple straps that allow for ideal resting in a seated position. 

Be sure to get the u shaped footplates too. The plastic ones are crap. 

Thought I would share with everyone. Have a great day. So this is probably ancient history, but.....   I hated my Quickie also although I have friends that love them.     Part of the problem, well, hell, all of the problem is that I got talked into a non folding one against my better judgement and I have to take ALL the wheels off to fit it in a car (what a pain) or need to put it in the bed of a truck which isn't good if you can't walk in the first place or it rains out.     I'm currently in a semi custom TiLite that seems to be bulletproof.   I just had my first claim on it after over a year of it going in and out of airplanes 5-6 times a month, and it was pretty minor.    It's easy to fold up quite small to jam behind the seat in my truck also. Medicare pays for a new one every 5-6 years.
