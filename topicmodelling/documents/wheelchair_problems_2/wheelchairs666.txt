Searching for BRITISH POWERED wheelchair users Hey,

My name is Leigh Rebekah Abbott and I'm a research assistant at the University of South Wales. I am currently recruiting BRITISH POWERED wheelchair users to be interviewed. If anyone is interested, or knows of anyone, please reply to this message, or you can drop me an email at leigh.abbott@southwales.ac.uk 
Thanks! :)  My wheelchair isn't powered by British people I might be able to help. What would the interview be about?  Haha! That is weirdly worded, huh! Just asking about the features of your wheelchair, and your social interactions ðŸ˜Š Do you think you'll be interested? :) I think so Would you mind emailing me to discuss further? ðŸ˜Š
