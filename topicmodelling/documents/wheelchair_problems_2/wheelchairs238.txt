Hotel Accommodations? Hey all! Wondering if anyone knows of a website designed specifically for hotels or AirBNB-style rentals that are wheelchair accessible. Thanks! I found this one [Access Travel Center](http://www.accesstravelcenter.com/hotels.cfm). Not a Hotel.com like site, but has hotels. You might want to look at Planat.
