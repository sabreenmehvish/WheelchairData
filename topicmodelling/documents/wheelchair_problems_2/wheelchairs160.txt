This tracks are mounted below our wheelchair. The final motors will be 10 times faster.  I love the concept but I'm mostly curiously about that initial drop there at the top of the steps. A lot of uncontrolled weight re-distribution right there. Like /u/ghostretch said, that sudden jerk worries me.  That is a strong action going on and will likely hurt the rider.  I would think a seat area would have to have some kind of gyroscopic stabilization to minimize that initial drop.
