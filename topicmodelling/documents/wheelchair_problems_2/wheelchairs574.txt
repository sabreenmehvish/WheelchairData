Illinois Tech students are taking on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) 'L' station turnstiles. Answer our survey to help us make the CTA more accessible!  As part of a semester long undergraduate research project at the Illinois Institute of Technology, my classmates and I are addressing accessibility issues of Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) 'l' stations. Specifically, we are focusing on the several types of turnstiles employed at 'L' stations, and whether there might me room for improvement upon the current system.

If you have ever taken the 'L' (Chicago's elevated public rail system), we would very much appreciate your input. The survey should take less than 5 minutes. Thanks!
