Shower chair rental in San Deigo My girlfriend is travelling to San Diego in November and needs to rent a self-propelled shower/commode chair for two weeks. A shower transfer bench isn't really any use because her balance isn't great and she needs her arms to hold herself up.

Anyone have any ideas? Have you tried Eric's Medical Supply? Browsing through their website, they seem to have a huge range of things for rent. I didn't see a shower wheelchair specifically, but they say on their front page that if you ask, they can try their best to get it. Might be worth a shot to call, and if they don't have it, they could maybe point you in the right direction.

http://ericsmedicalsupply.com/rentals.html You can often find them at goodwill for next to nothing for purchase.   Might be cheaper and easier than trying to find one to rent..... You can take a look here http://goesanywhere.com. GO Mobility Solutions provides Travel shower/commode wheelchair.
