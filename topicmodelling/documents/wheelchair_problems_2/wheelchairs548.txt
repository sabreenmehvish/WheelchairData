So, are most wheelchair parts, not dependent on size, universal? Also, a sizing question. I know brake assemblies are, but I'm looking for a metal footrest (tube, plate, and all) for my mom. She has her foot on it a lot, and the plastic eventually warps. I feel like this would help her out. She has a Invacare chair, and as far as I can tell, they don't make fully metal footrests. 

As far as sizing, she also needs some new upholstery for her seat. How do I measure what size is needed? Just measure across the seat?  Invacare does offer aluminum footplates for most chairs. You may have to order complete leg rests though.    Just make sure the mounting to attach to the frame is the same. 

The upholstery is measured from the middle of the seat rail then front to back.   Most standard chairs come in even sizes, so 16, 18, 20, etc wide and usually 18 or 16 deep.   A custom chair could easily have different sizes.  Alright. I guess I'm just not looking close enough, then. I still can't find them. Is there a particular site that's good for replacement parts? 

And thank you for the measurement advice. I know it's not custom, so it should be simple enough.  You may need to look at other invacare models to find them. They usually offer one or two styles per model. Just last week I looked at a pair of aluminum footplates for a 9000SL.

If not, you could always try The Aftermarket Group. I don't know if they sell to individuals though. Also check there for the upholstery.
