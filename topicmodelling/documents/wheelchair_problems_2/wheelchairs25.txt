We want to make London more accessible, can you help? Dear all ,
 
I represent Mobilicity, a collective of urbanists gathering data on the way mobility-impaired people feel about travelling around London in order to make Londonâ€™s transport network more accessible. The aim of our project, which is fully funded by the European Commission Horizon 2020 Programme, is to highlight any areas which pose particular challenges or barriers to transport for mobility-impaired users.
 
To conduct our analysis, we have developed a smartphone app which will track the trajectories of our volunteers (completely anonymously) as they use the London transport network over a three-month period. Volunteers will also be able to make comments on their journeys and offer suggestions as they travel. 
 
We are now looking for volunteers who, for any reason, find it difficult to physically access public transport to use our app and contribute to our dataset. This can include a wide variety of groups with mobility restrictions, from the elderly, to parents with pushchairs, to those with physical disabilities. We are hoping to get a large and diverse range of users for the greatest amount of data and were hoping you would be able to help us in sharing this with your contacts and networks? Our website contains more information as well as a section for participants to get involved.
 
Please let me know how you could help us to spread the word about our project or if anyone wants to participate!



With kind regards,

villy@mobilicity.london Sounds awesome!
Hopefully the project will be a success,
 and then repeated all over the EU :) If you haven't already, cross-post to /r/London for more visibility because this is a small sub. Yes, I have posted there too. Thanks anyway!
