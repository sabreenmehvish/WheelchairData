Aero-Z casters won't stay vertical. Anybody having trouble keeping their TiLIte casters vertical? I have the Speedloader mounts. I keep moving them, but if I hit a bump, they slip. I've tried resetting them past vertical, but there doesn't seem to be a setting that will allow that, even when I rotate the end caps.  Do you have pics? It sounds odd. If they're the same mounts I'm thinking, then have a round disc with lots of holes, and you screw into the right hole to lock it at that angle. After that, they really can't move.

How are your casters moving when hitting bumps? I wonder if something is off, worn, etc. Pics will help.  It sounds like it might be the bolt in the angle adjustment is not holding.  I normally don't advocate using it on manual chairs but a little BLUE loctite might help hold that bolt. Please make sure to not use red and to make sure all items are fully seated before tightening the bolt.  Thanks for answering so promptly. And my apologies for not getting back to you earlier.

The casters are the ones you're describing. They can only move a small amount, but it's enough to make the chair pull to one side and for the still-vertical caster to always be the one that bumps on concrete joints.  I don't see how to attach a picture here. I'll find a web page that has one.  The casters are down the page a bit. I have two-armed casters. https://www.lightningmobility.com.au/products/manual-wheelchairs/tilite-zra
