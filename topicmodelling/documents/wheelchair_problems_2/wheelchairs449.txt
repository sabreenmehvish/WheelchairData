Sport chair recommendations needed I'm 70, have difficulty walking distances due to a neurological disorder, and am looking to buy a used sport wheelchair. Can anyone recommend a specific folding sport model? (it will ride on a bike rack at the back of my Miata) If you know any place that sells used chairs, please include that info. Warnings about certain manufacturers or models that don't work as promised are appreciated. I'm an absolute nooby and need all the advice I can get! Quick question, are you looking for a chair to actually do sport in or the fancy chairs that you see full time users in and people often call 'sporty chairs'?

['Sporty' chair](http://www.wheelchairsireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RGK-Octane-Wheelchairs-Ireland-500x500.jpg) Actually known as an 'active' or 'energy efficient' wheelchair. 

Additionally, what are you hoping to use it for and what is your budget? I'm assuming you want a 'sporty' (active/EE) chair as true sport chairs don't tend to fold. I've not seen one that does anyway.  From your description, it seems like you want a more "active" wheelchair (something - I'm assuming - lightweight and easy to push yourself around in) as opposed to something made for wheelchair sports (IE wheelchair basketball or rugby).

Tilite has some very good lightweight folding wheelchairs. You'll pay a decent amount for them though. However, if you are looking for an used wheelchair, you can often find decent ones on eBay (if you are of approx average body size) however, the selection is often limited. Depends on your budget. Panthera makes a phenomenal rigid carbon fiber wheelchair. 

Ti-lite is also a standard, their titanium frames are hard to beat.

I would avoid offshore if you can. I ran into an Italian made chair that had some odd stem bearings. Sourced from a local company my cost was $38 each. Standard bearings should be no more than $5-$10. 

Edit: saw you were looking for used, look for something adjustable. Rigid frames tend to be all welded or one piece so no adjustment to your Center of gravity. This could mean very back heavy(tippy) or front loading(destroy bearings quickly).
