A real, working tank chair. Yesterday a post was made for a tracked chair. If anyone is looking for one, please look into [Action Track chair](http://actiontrackchair.com) instead. I have worked with Action in the past and have helped several clients get them. Action has been around for over a decade and stands by all of their products. I have personally tested their chairs in rural South Dakota and urban Utah. One of my clients was able to see hunt in SD, elk hunt in Wyoming, and moose hunt in Alaska. In all three cases, he was able to use his chair to transport the animal back to his truck.  I own one, it's awesome! It's a great product with excellent customer service! i'm too scared of a breakdown out in the middle on nowhere...
 Good to hear. I just hope that they can grow as they make a really good product. These things rarely break down. They limit the parts to a minimum and over engineer them. The only one I saw break down was easily fixed. They are very heavy and hard to push in freewheel so it is best to have someone with you when you go way out there. Even one breakdown is too much.
