Just got my TiLite ZRA and I'm in love! Need some suggestions for beefier tires I go to burning man but this will be my first year in a chair the playa and can be dusty, dunes, or hard packed craters. I'm trying to make sure I have a free wheel by the time I go which will help a ton.
When bikes get sent out people are always told the wider the tire the better.
I'm not sure if I need a beefier tire I'm talking to burning man folks but if I do what are your recommendations? Wow, playa rolling huh. I've been meaning to go for so long. What kind of wheels do you have?  I would suggest a set of foam inserts for a pair of knobby Kendas. If you're planning on any hard use during burning man, a flat would blow!

We sell a lot of these to the off-road guys. You can get them in a 24x2.10" or 22x1.95" 

You'll likely want to change your casters too, I'll see if I can dig up something a little more suitable for off road.

Edit #2: can you tell me what you've got for front forks &amp; casters now? http://imgur.com/1XRO5Hj At the moment I have schwalbe I think? I don't know if there is any other distinguishing stuff on it I'm new to this. Schwalbe is a tire manufacturer. What wheels are you using?
