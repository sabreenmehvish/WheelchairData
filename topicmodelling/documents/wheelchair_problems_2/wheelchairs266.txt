What kind of jeans/pants do y`all wear? So I've been using jeans that are designed for big/tall because I had a really big belly. I've lost about 65 lbs over the last year and the jeans are not fitting as well, as you could probably guess. So, now I'm down to a reasonable size and need some new jeans. I'm looking for/wondering if y`all know about high waisted jeans for guys that don't run $70US a pair. I shop at Kohl's. They always have sweet deals and the dressing rooms are quite accessible, at least where I live.  Why high waisted? I personally like Gap and Levi 514. I just stick to anything straight leg so my tiny chicken legs don't get swallowed whole.  I'm a girl, so I've recently done a closet conversion to leggings and skirts (not much help to a guy, I know). But I recently bought a pair of long/tall cargo pants at LL Bean and they are quite nice and the waistband is quite high. Their jeans run for about $45, but they are of a good quality.  I get jeans from rollitex. They make them for people in wheelchairs. The backs are higher than the front so they fit quite well when sitting down - no builders Crack :)
They also do a slim fit, not skinny jeans but just cut for skinny wasted away legs. Extra long zips too which make them a lot easier to get on and off. Only downside is the price, about 80 euros a pair. I've found that Apt 9 jeans at Kohl's taper well enough that they don't look super baggy on my legs. They're usually cheap enough with sales and whatnot, and they seem to fit me pretty well. Might be worth trying. I've been looking for nice fashionable jeans that would be comfortable to wear in my wheelchair, but at that price (it would cost me about $150 for a pair plus shipping to Canada) I think I rather be uncomfortable.  Yeah they are expensive, there are probably other companies doing something similar online in the US that would be cheaper.
