Wireless charging might be coming to wheelchairs in a couple years. A prototype charging system has been developed and is being tested.  This is cool news but I am worried about the quotes that states they are hoping users will charge more often. I wonder how the battery life is during the day. I don't understand how this improves mobility. Is the vision that these will become more ubiquitous than standard electrical sockets? Seems a little far fetched, what other uses do they have? I think the goal is to have these all over so your chair can charge as you are stopped while doing every day activities. I know there are some people out there that would benefit from a system like this. I had one guy that had zero dexterity in his hands but enough strength to transfer. He could not plug his chair in so he was reliant on a caretaker, he would benefit from this and would be more independent.

I wonder how far, or how strong, the charging field is. Could these be adapted into a desk to make a full wireless charging surface? Maybe run a monitor or charge a laptop while working? Ah i gotcha, maybe multiple places in the house. I was thinking they intended to have them as a public utility or something
