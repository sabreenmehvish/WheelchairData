Grocery Shopping... HOW?!? I am a new powerchair user (and a new Redditor! hi!), and I am confused as to how I'm supposed to grocery shop effectively.

With my manual chair, I was able to hook my feet into the bottom of the cart, and basically act like a tractor-trailer pushing and steering the cart.

Now... Do y'all use those personal carts? Do you always shop with a caregiver? 

It doesn't help I use public transportation.

I'm just really baffled. Im a power chair user. I also use public transportation. My tip, carry what you can in those little baskets. Then when you have bags, clip them on your seat belt. (this wont work if you have a lot of bags.) I do something similar with my feet in a powerchair... What makes it harder to do so? (I've never used a manual, sorry for my ignorance.)

If you have the ability, you could pull a cart behind you. Smaller carts are easier, of course. Downside being you take up more room in an aisle.

A lot of people use the little baskets, but I think they would impede my reach too much so I don't. You could always ask if a store associate is available to help you, instead of a caregiver. I use Peapod.com primarily for my groceries. It's a lot easier than going to the store. Less expensive also. I use a mix of strategies. I tend to shop more frequently and in smaller chunks, so I can just carry one big double bagged purchase on my lap. I also make extensive use of online options, which is great for larger scale pantry stocking. In my area Safeway delivers--which has been an amazing boon to my shopping style. If I didn't have the Safeway option, I've eyed Amazon Pantry as an option. There are grocery delivery options increasing in availability every day now, and with good grocery list planning I've always found the delivery fees worth it.  hi there. I use a manual chair, but when i do the shopping i only do a little top up shop, and i put the basket on my lap. If I cant reach something then I ask a passer by to get it for me. I also do online shopping for the larger stuff.
Also here in the UK, if you go to the customer service desk you can ask for some one to help you with your shopping. ( i know thats probs hard though as you need to get it all home.) Would online shopping be an option? Thank you, I appreciate it. That sounds like it may work well. 

I'm trying to find a sturdy backpack that will fit my chair as well, so that will make things easier, too. The angle and length of my footplate seem like they would make it difficult. Although, I could fold it up and try it that way. Also, still getting used to maneuvering my chair by itself lol. You could also get those bags they let you buy so you can put things in it before buying. I end up folding mine up, and use the cart bottom rack for my feet. Since i cant push/pull with feet; i use my knees against the cart and lean to push fit knees in turns.  I have a captain's/auto style seat (not hard pan) with two prong car style headrest. Since i can pivot in my seat i use the [car style headrest hooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LXT4726/ref=mp_s_a_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1502248206&sr=8-6&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&keywords=car+headrest+hooks&dpPl=1&dpID=41K04JWFr4L&ref=plSrch) and a dowel to hold full reusable bags. Can safely carry and 20lbs without breaking anything, then rest goes in my lap or footplate.
