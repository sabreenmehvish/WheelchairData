Modifying medicare powerchair I got a powerchair from medicare in September 2015 and its been a year and therefore should no long be rented. 

I read that medicare will still pay for some repairs even though the chair is no longer rented. My question is if I modify the chair (like say hook up LED lights to the chair's battery) will medicare still pay for repairs? Has anybody else made modifications to there chair and still had medicare/medicaid pay for repairs? Talk to your wheelchair dealer. Explain what you want to do and ask them if it will impact your ability to get it serviced through Medicare. They should be able to tell you. I mod my chair a bunch. I'm on MD medicaid. They never check. Post a pic when you get *pimped*.  

Guy in town has all kinds of things added,cig lighter, sound system, led's, outlets for phone charging. Has a 400 watt inverter, runs his lap top and a couple of 110 outlets for a fan and small draw stuff. 

Pimp that ride:)
