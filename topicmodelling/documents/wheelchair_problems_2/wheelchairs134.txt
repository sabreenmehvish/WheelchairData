Rain and Wet Legs My company manufactures products for wheelchair users. A customer contacted me with a suggestion of a product to keep wheelchair users leg's dry when it rains (or snows). 

My questions:

* Is wet legs a problem in the rain?

* What do you currently use to keep your legs dry in the rain?

* How satisfied are you with this?

Edit: OK, You folks have convinced me to go ahead with my customer's suggestion and create this product. It will take me a few months to have a few samples made. If any of you want to be testers, send me your email address by PM, together with a short description (Height, power or manual chair, etc) Testers get free samples in return for feedback. If you will have the possibility to blog about it or write about it after it is ready to launch, it will be a big plus.  This is a huge problem for me, since I tend to live in rainy cities. My solution up until now is to pull up a 50gal trash bag over my shoes and pants and wear a water resistant jacket on top. As of now I have nothing to keep my legs dry unless I put a poncho on and that makes pushing a pain. I mean I prefer not to be wet, but it depends on how long I’ll be in whatever pants I’m wearing when they get wet. If I’ll be home a little while later it’s not terrible but if I’m out rolling around for awhile I hate it.  I usually wear a skirt in bad weather so it’s just my legs that get wet—no wet cloth that takes forever to dry.   Then I only need to contend with the little bit that sticks out between the tire and the clothing guard.  I tried wearing a longer raincoat but that was pain—probably to the same degree  as a poncho would be (which I’ve never tried) I forgot to add that if it’s really crappy out and I’ll be out for a while I wear rainpants.  Which I hate putting on and taking off.  The sides of it.  If it’s nasty out I wear boots or waterproof shoes.  Or I put on neoprene boots which stay warm even if they’re damp, and they never feel wet even if they are.  50 gal (US) ≈ 190 L

Is it working for you? Thanks alot. Next question...what do you wear when it rains, just a jacket with hood?

Do you have problems with wet  and dirty sleeves?
 Just your legs get wet? Are you OK with that? What about your shoes and socks? Been doing it the past 10 years or so now. That said, a less... trashy looking option would be nice. I have a jacket. I don’t usually deal with that because my jacket fits really well on my arms.  Look at my edit above Just to confirm: 

* Your jacket never rubs the tires when you push.

* There no spray from the tires to your arms or hands. 

* The only issue you have in the rain is your wet legs. Well in two of my chairs I have panels in between the wheels and cushion so I usually tuck the jacket in between, but my third chair doesn’t have these so it does sometimes get wet. I’d have to be moving pretty damn fast to get spray from my wheels. Not sure if that’s because I use schwalbe tires or because I just don’t roll fast enough normally. Realistically, though, my cushion and backrest getting wet pisses me off more.  You say that the poncho makes pushing a pain. Is there a way to make a "wheelchair friendly" poncho? I’ve been trying to think about that for years and really can’t quite figure it out. The biggest problem I have with the poncho is that it gets stuck in the wheels and tears a hole through it. I guess the only real solution is a jacket with sleeves that have elastic or something at the wrists to keep from getting in the way of your hands and a long torso that you could pull over your knees?  What part of the poncho gets stuck in the wheels?
