I just tookThe Freelwheel Wheelchair Adapter on a bike trail and it's awesome. (pics of me using it in the comments)  [pics](http://imgur.com/GLCeTkM) Pat has designed a great product at an affordable price. Hats off to Pat I've been really considering buying one, how does it handle in mud/snow? I don't get the purpose of the extra wheel if it doesn't have a motor attached to it. I want one of these. Any down side to it so far?  Just went on the trail again. Snow is still kind of rough, but it never left me stranded.  I haven't really gotten to try it in those conditions yet, just got it properly adjusted and tested. I'll definitely be taking it out more though, so I'll report back. It lifts your front casters off the ground, they tend to dig into the ground move when going over varying ground types. With this wheel it just pushes over. I guess sort of like a bike would..

Sorry, for the late reply. I only recently found this sub and kinda forgot about it. It can be tricky to get on properly at first, but over all I really like it.  Ah okay, thanks for the reply. Thanks. I will check it out. Probably a ridiculous price here in Australia though. It usually costs more, but it's available for $500 at disability expos here in the states. Inquire about its weight and calculate shipping charges. I'll send it to you from here if the difference is significant.  Thanks. Some things I can buy from the US and get shipped over without problems. Other companies  (looking at you Roho) won't let US suppliers ship here and instead charge a stupid amount via local suppliers. Thankfully there are a lot of shipping companies in the US I can use to get around this. Where there is a wheel, there is a way right. All the best mate.
