Looking for a walker (or something) capable of getting through narrow doorways. I have cerebral palsy and I use a kaye posture walker like this one: http://www.rehabmart.com/include-mt/img-resize.asp?path=/imagesfromrd/KP-W12B.jpg&width=450&height=342&product_name=Kaye%20Posture%20Control%20Walker
(Best picture I could find).

Getting through narrow doorways is difficult because at it's widest point my walker is 25.25" and some narrow doorways are as small as 20".
So, I've been on the hunt for a walker or some device I could use through narrow spots. The problem is everything I'm finding either isn't narrow enough or it's the kind of walker elderly people use (which don't give me enough stability). Even if I had to have someone make me something, that would be fine, I just don't know what would work. Any suggestions??
