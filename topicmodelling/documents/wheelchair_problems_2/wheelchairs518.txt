Washing your face I will be in a wheelchair for a while and have figured out almost every self care task except washing my face. It's just incredibly hard to get my face over and splash enough water on it to get the soap off. My bathroom sink is the kind with a set of flush cabinets underneath so I can get simply roll my legs under it. The best I can do it turn sideways and try to lean over but I get water everywhere and not much on my face. I have bad acne so it is important to wash my face thoroughly several times a day and not just use wipes.  Do it when you're in the shower?  use a flannel/washcloth/whatever you call it to rinse your face Wash your face in the shower in the morning. Use a washclothe at night. Or find an old/clean/deep bowl/bucket to set on your lap. I put a cut off ice cream bucket with water in it on the  kitchen table and wash my face and hair there. Works good for me. I keep a towel on my lap, wheel up to sink (sideways), lock brakes, put the towel over the edge of sink, wet hands, face, wash face, splash water to rinse, blot face, then mop up any splashes of water. :) You can do it, just requires a bit more planning and prep than it does when walking. 
 Try micellar water! I used to use oil but it became to hard. Now I use micellar water and moisturizer cream because I live it the cold. It's much easier.

Also you could ask at skincareaddiction subreddit I know this post is ancient but just in case.. Fill the sink up instead of just trying to use the running water. The awkward angle for me was the biggest problem, I couldn't enough water in the right place. When you fill the sink up it's basically moving the faucet forward 6 inches or whatever. Much easier and much more control.
