Adjustable Push Handles? Hi, I use a Kuschall K-Lite wheelchair with adjustable push handles as shown here http://www.epc-wheelchairs.co.uk/image/cache/catalog/EPC%20Images/Products/kuschall-bolt-on-height-adjustable-push-handles-875x1000.JPG

However the thread inside the clamps keep going after a couple of months and it's costing me a fortune to replace each time. Anyone have any alternatives or clamps that would last longer and fit to a rigid wheelchair?  Do you need them adjustable out can they be fixed height?   The mounting blocks are usually made using a soft aluminum so the constant adjusting will fatigue the metal.   You can look into a different pipe clamp system from a hardware store.  They can be fixed but will need to be taken on and off as they get in my way when I'm not pushed.
