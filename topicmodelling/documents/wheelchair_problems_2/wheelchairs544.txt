Help us improve Scalevo - The Stairclimbing Wheelchair I am one of the students behind the stair climbing wheelchair Scalevo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lb_8nmy90c).

We are currently developing an improved version of the wheelchai to win [Cybathlon 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx9I_hYqQcM), a paralympics style competition with robotic support!
Afterwards we plan to bring the wheelchair to the market.

And thats where we need your know-how and experiences! We set up a survey to asses the needs of wheelchair drivers around the world, so we can develop the best possible wheelchair!

The survey takes about 10 to 15 min to complete and you can find it here:

www.scalevo.ch/survey

It would also help us a lot if you could share the survey with your friends!

Thank you so much for helping us improve the Scalevo wheelchair.

You can find out more about the Scalevo wheelchair on our website:
