Wheelchair Users Can Go Down Stairs with New Invention  Down's fine... now what do they have in mind about going back *up*?

Does look nice for a cushioned rear wheel type though, versus the current sprung designs. Color me unconvinced. Neat idea, but I feel as if it is just like shock absorbers - they would make going down stairs more comfortable, not necessarily a whole lot easier. You would still need the balance and strength that you would normally need for more traditional wheels. 

And, going down is much more plausible than going back up.  It is a piece of the problem, not the whole thing. But it would help many people. It wouldn't eliminate ramps of course but to be able to easily go down a few stairs would be a big thing. Getting up is of course still a problem.
