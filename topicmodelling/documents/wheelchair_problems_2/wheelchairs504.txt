Has This Ever Happened to You???  I've hit my own children! They walk in front of me and stop before I have a chance to react lol. I've run over their legs and feet and they all survive ;) LOL They STILL do it though! No matter how many times they get hit I used to repair wheelchairs then I sold them. I have been run over more times than I can count.  ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚! That is awesome! Thank you so much for this response. It made my day! It is a horrible thing! I have run over my own foot trying to drive it from the outside...lol LOL I'm glad it made you laugh. At this point at age 11 and 13 they know if they get hit 99% change it's their own fault HAHA I just had a conversation about people in wheelchair with kids. We discussed how judgemental others can be. It is good to know you are out there. It gives me hope for my future! Also, please subscribe to my Subreddit. Reddit.com/r/JazBrown. And my Youtube channel. I talk about all sorts of topics. Have a wonderful day.
