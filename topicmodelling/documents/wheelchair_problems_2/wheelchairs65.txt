An interview with Rick Hansen, who wheeled over 40,000 kilometres around the world from 1985-87, raising over $26 million for spinal cord research and accessibility initiatives  Funny - definitely not a story untold. This story was told in Rick's memoir, Rick Hansen: Man in Motion, it was retold in the motivational book written after that, it was told in a few different documentaries and even a motion picture released in 2012 or 2013 called Heart of A Dragon. 

I guess it's a story told to a new audience.
