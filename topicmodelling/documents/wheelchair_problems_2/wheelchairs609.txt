Ceramic Bearings for casters!!! Wonder how they perform with weight on 'em  I use ceramic bearings with my casters. They perform excellently. They can take a hell of a beating too... I used them for skateboarding prior to life in the chair.  Are they used on casters only, or the larger drive wheels as well? I would love to have them on a tennis chair!
