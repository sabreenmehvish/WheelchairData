There's not a LOT of stuff on this site, but there are products here which I have been thinking about for decades.  There are some good stuff here. I will be showing this to my clients! Any idea what the car carrier looks like??? Also, I just opened my own company and would like to bring unique products like this to the market. If OP would like to discuss some ideas, maybe we can get together and bring 'em to the market! It's a struggle snuggle if you can't roll away, right?
