First test of our completely self developend whelchair by a disabled person. The chair can overcome curbs forward, climb stairs and balance on two wheels.  Thats actually pretty cool. I like how it isn't any bigger than other power chairs.  Don't get me wrong, I love the looks of this chair and it solves a lot of problems. But when you start going on up the stairs backwards in this thing you're gonna get all kinds of looks and gawks. Especially since it looks like it takes a bit of time to get up them. Love it. 95% of the time the step issue is 1-2 steps. I'd definitely trust it for that and could use this tomorrow. That is very cool. But it reminds me a lot of the iBot. Do you remember that chair? The iBot could covercome curbs, climb stairs and balance on two wheels. But it was taken off of the market in 2009 because it did not sell.  I am not sure why the iBot was not successful. Probably because the pricing was so high. I think it came out around $30k and later the price was reduced a bit. But not enough to make much of a difference. Anyway, good luck with this. There definitely is a need. But don't repeat the mistakes of the iBot. nice compact concept.
