Wheel Chair Charging Problem Survey (Thank You)  I just wanted to add we are a group of high school student looking to simplify the charging process of electric mobility devices by adding magnets to the end of the connectors. Effectively making a mag-safe like charging system. Great idea, I'd buy one if it were cheap (under $30). Just some constructive (I hope!) criticism:

* Be mindful of the strength of the magnets. Many in powerchairs have severely reduced muscle strength. I myself have about a 3lb max in my arms, and that's really, really pushing it. A "weak" magnet to you can easily be super strong to us.
* In the survey, you should've mentioned it was like a magsafe. Just saying it's "simplified" is extremely vague - what could be simple for one user could be impossible for another. Thanks for the input! â˜º We can always use a new perspective. We understand the need to keep the magnets as easy to remove as possible while still trying to limit accidental disconnections. While I know this won't be able to help everyone we are just trying make a device to help the biggest group of people. Once ago thanks for the input.
