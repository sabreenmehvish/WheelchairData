[Repost] Wheelchair Accessibility Survey Hello, we are a team of seniors from Jamesville-Dewitt High School in New York, and are working on solving difficulties that wheelchair users face daily. We would appreciate any response to our survey so we may gather data and gain direction towards a suitable solution. Please do not answer unless you use or have used a wheelchair. Thank you for your help.
