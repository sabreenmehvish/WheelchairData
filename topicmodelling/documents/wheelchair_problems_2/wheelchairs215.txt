Sex with an SCI I am a L2 incomplete. I have been in a chair about 9 years. My gf and I have a fulfilling sex life for the most part. I love having sex with her and she loves having sex with me. I can get an erection but I have trouble keeping it up after the fact. I use viagra and that helps but I still face frustration when I can't get hard and penetrate her. Since my injury I have learned I love nipple play and having my neck nibbled on, sucked, and bitten. I can partially feel my penis but it's kinda numb. I find that I get more pleasure from harder rubbing and playing further down my shaft. I was wondering what other things we can do together to spice up our sex life and toys or new methods that would help me have a stronger orgasm. My orgasm is gives me a fraction of the pleasure that I used to have. I am very open to trying new things, really anything that will feel amazing. My gf is very loving and reassuring of my insecurities with sex. The positions that work best for both of us is when she is on top or she is laying on her stomach and hitting it from behind. What things would ya'll recommend to help with sex?
