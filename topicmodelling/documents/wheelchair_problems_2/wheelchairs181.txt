A very stylish and minimalist power-chair design study. I love it's practicality.  I don't get these designs with the low hip hugging backs. 

They look great but the majority of people I know who use power chairs sit in them for hours at a time. A large portion of them don't have great core because of injury so the idea of sitting without significant support seems a bit far fetched. 

This kind of design might be appealing for some, but I do think for the majority of users this is far from practical for long term use.

It reminds me of that 3D printable manual chair that was discussed a couple of years ago with the plasticky hard molded low backed seat.  If apple designed a chair in the early 2000s it would have had this aesthetic, very cool. I didn't read how heavy the base was for lifting into the car.  Understandably not useable be all, but great got those who can.

Heck, I was Uber excited about the segway seat and that didn't even have a back at all.

I should say, my daily driver has an 8" back and that's from the seat pan. My thoughts exactly... Apple designs are amazing, their sale process, not so much. Wheelchairs are expensive enough without Apple taxing them. I don't even want to think about an Apple wheelchair. Agreed!

A lot of people that use electric often seem to have very low mobility. The chair does look sexy but eh - like a phone, I prefer something bigger. Came to say the same. It’s like the Segway powerchair. Who has the trunk control if you’re in a wheelchair?
