Swiss students developed probably the coolest wheelchair in the world  This is awesome, but for $35 thousand it better come with a built in air conditioner and massage settings.  This is pretty neat but..
Did he shoplift that wine? Brilliant!  This has some brilliant bits! But unless I can load it into a regular hatchback, (aka no need for a special van, or a rear attachment) and it’s waterproof to boot, I think I’ll stick with my 3k electric. But damn that ability to do low stairs and raise and lift WOULD be sweet. But I live in a city full of shit parking where a van is right out, and we have massive thunderstorms nearly daily for much of the year.  I wonder how easy it is to transport, getting that in and out of a car unless its specially adapted will be tricky. Otherwise it looks very very cool, so much versatility and functionality. I prefer the ones that you can travel with So many chair prices seem to assume insurance or some other structure are going to help pay for the chair. I know these things are expensive to build (especially with as much new tech as this has) but there are enough chairs out there that cost almost as much as this and have about the same number of features as my 3k chair does. (Or less! Mine can handle a drenching in a thunderstorm!) It’s nuts. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t drooling over this one a bit, though.  Compared to other full feature power chairs the price isn’t too far off.  yeah a fully loaded Quantum or Permobil costs about the same. At least this one goes up steps.
