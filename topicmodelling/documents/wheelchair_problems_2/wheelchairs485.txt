Brake repair Recently the scissor brakes on my chair no longer stay under my chair when they are unengaged. Does anyone have any insight in repairing these? Below is a PDF of the specific brakes I have on my chair.

I'd find a replacement. If you're adventurous, you can use a similar normal spring and just bend the ends 90 degrees to fit into the same spots.  It sounds like the spring that keeps the lock away from your tire when it's not engaged broke. It's a pretty common issue I think. Easy fix is to wrap a rubber band around the brake a few times so it forces it together. I can upload pictures of what mine looks like if you want. You shouldn't need to get new ones just yet.  After checking on spring #3 liked the others have said, tighten bolts #7 & #8.  Then check to see if they are right against the wheels when locked. Those are the most common reasons why wheel locks disengage.  Amy other questions, feel free to reach out.  Thanks for all of that.   I took out the spring and the end was broken so I will have to replace that. Not sure where I will be getting that though. I have a Home Depot here in town but the spring seems awfully small to be there. I will look though. 

Tightening up the #13 bolt keeps the brake under the chair much better than what it was doing so that just fix the problem. 

Thanks again.
