Anyone familiar with Karman Wheelchair brand? A little background. I need a power chair to go long distances, like basically anywhere outside my apartment. I can't stand for long periods of time without my legs getting extremely tired. I want to start helping my fiance with things like cooking and doing the dishes but we don't have a fully accessible apartment so I was looking into a standing wheelchair and ran across this one:

I can't seem to find any reviews online for it but the price at 8500 dollars at most retailers seems too good to be true. Anyway, wondering if these are junk or just a lower end brand? I don't intend to use it all the time so it won't get typical wear and tear.
Any thoughts? I only have experience with their manuals- I have an Ergo Flight that I use for travel- but I'm extremely pleased with it. They ARE too good to be true- the attention paid to small design details is unbelievable. Sturdy, comfortable, stylish, *and* cheap. My only caveat is that you'll likely run into some trouble finding replacement parts- you'll have to go direct to the manufacturer.
