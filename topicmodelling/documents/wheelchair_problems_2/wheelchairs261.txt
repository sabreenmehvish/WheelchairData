Loopwheels, Exciting new tech for wheelchair users! Suspension in the wheel...  Interesting idea, that you can just snap on and off the wheels makes this actually quite practical as suspension on a hard surface is a pain. I kinda like these. Good concept. I'll have to read up about them some more. I wonder if I can install different push rims on these? One of the rewards could be matching caster wheels (albeit without the suspension.)  I'm glad they are upfront about the wheel weight. 
My first concern is how the independent suspension each wheel offers will change the ride dynamics.
Thanks for posting and glad to innovative idea applied to our community. My friend says that this could ultimately slow things down a bit though or at least make pushing take more effort by de-centering the axle which means you'd have to work harder to make it turn because you're suddenly pushing  against more of the weight of the wheel or something. I didn't totally understand it. I was wondering if a design like this could work for casters to help them not get stuck on so many cracks etc.  The suspension is actually not as "springy" as you would think, it works great on hard surfaces too. The people who have used them for extended time have told us that they really work well to remove the smaller vibrations which tire you overtime! Any suspension is going to be a pain on hard surfaces as you have to push harder to get the same thrust. When you spend all day in an office or at a school you do not want suspension, any form of suspension on carpet is horrible. But I could see a place for them on the weekends when you are out pushing, taking the dog for a walk or something.
