Motorized wheelchair help I am currently living in Southern California. I have a manual chair for long distances but due to my disorder am unable to push myself. We are looking into getting a motorized wheelchair. The trick is we are planning to move to CO. 
I want something lightweight so I don't have to rely on others since I will be on a college campus. I also don't know if my car can handle a wheelchair on the back. BUT what about snow? I was looking into the EZ cruiser but it says it's not safe to use in snow. 

Does anyone have any options/ advice? I'm feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Have you considered power assist? You can often put them on any chair, and are very useful for longer distances. They're also cheaper and lighter than a full power chair. I’ve had very little luck with things working well in the snow I’m afraid.  I live in Alaska so I see plenty of it too.  If my tires are good the motorized part doesn’t work well and visa versa.   I have a very lightweight folding chair and use a max mobility assist (which I love) with it because it takes about 2 seconds to remove and install.  However, it sucks in the snow and sand and I have to be careful to turn the bluetooth connection off on the wrist controller so I don’t go when I don’t want to.     I have knobby tires that I push directly on the tire in the winter but going up hills in Colorado I expect that wouldn’t work real well for long periods of time.     None of them work well in snow and  manufacturers will tell you not to use them in rain or snow. You should be ok if the paths are cleared and salted. If you can lift, get something that comes into pieces and loads in your car. Sadly, the powerchair that can handle snow is not going to be foldable, nor light enough for you to fling into a car. I use a walker inside, and a powerchair outdoors. Look for: Accessible mainline buses, towns with adequate sidewalks where you can just roll from here to there, accessible taxis, or an accessible van. I've travelled on shoveled sidewalks and over icy bits &c for decades here in Wisconsin. I can power through around 3 inches that hasn't been shoveled.

The dream for any outdoor power wheeler is a [Frontier x8](http://www.mobility-usa.com/extreme-x8--4x4.html). I've driven up a sandhill and over snow with this "personal ATV". But it's too large to use indoors or get on a standard city bus.

So here's what has worked for me:

- Big batteries - group 24. They take up more room and they are heavier. The good news is that they can handle cold weather. Battery capacity drops sharply in very cold weather -- I don't plan on going more than a mile when it's below zero F.
- Large front casters - Caster size determines maximum snow depth. Nine inch casters are a pain indoors and a dream outside; I've compromised on eight-inch.
- Excellent rain/wind protection - I wear a thick leather cape in winter, which makes a warm personal microclimate and protects the control equipment from the weather. Always have at least a bread bag over your controls when there's rain/snow. 
- Slightly deflated pneumatic rear tires - Another trade-off: the wider the better for good traction, the narrower for more maneuverability. 
- Rear wheel drive - Center-wheel is the fashion these days, but they are much more vulnerable to getting high-centered. 
 I haven't heard of a power assist. Would it still work with snow? They'll work as well as the tires you're using. The advantage of power assist is that you pick the wheels they go on. Just make sure you get good treads and be more careful than you think you need to be. High speeds and snow are a bad combo  Do they work on folding chairs or just rigid ones? I've never actually seen a set used on a folding chair but I don't see why not. I believe the motor is in the wheels themselves with a battery in a backpack. There's probably variation with different brands though Both the Sunrise Medical Xtender and the Alber(Invacare) E-motion wheels will work on rigid and folding chairs. The MaxMobility Smart Drive also works with rigid or folding but is harder to get on and off when you are alone. 

I personally like the E-motion the most as they are very compact and very water resistant. That would be the option I would get in this case. CO is not exactly a dry state.
