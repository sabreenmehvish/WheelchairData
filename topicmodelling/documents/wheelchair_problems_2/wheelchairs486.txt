19 year old looking for work..  I'm hoping for a little help with some job ideas. 
Just a little back ground - I contracted a rare virus during the summer after I graduated last year, it attacked my nervous system and flipped my world upside down. I wont go into too much detail about all of that but basically its been about 13 months and thanks to God I have made a lot of progress and can stand by myself and walk with a walker n such. 
I just applied for disability and want to find a place where I could work where a wheelchair wouldn't limit me from doing my job. Something simple and temporary because with the money im saving I plan to move to another state. Sitting at home all day drives me crazy. I was working full time while in school before all of this happened and loved it. Any ideas/suggestions are appreciated, thank you If you are in the US you should find out what your state offers through the Department of Rehabilitation (DOR). They can place you somewhere where your limitations will be seriously taken into account. 

I totally get how you feel. I hate sitting at home all day. It's great for the first couple of weeks but then you just feel like you're in a nicer version of prison. 

I started working with the DOR and they are getting me a job as a medical receptionist. You could also apply to call centres like Geico (they are *always* hiring). You can pretty much apply to most companies as they are always looking to fill their "diversity quota" so they'll make accommodations for you for the most part. Just don't apply to work in something you obviously can't do like stocking shelves or construction. 

Good luck! ♡♡ Thank you so much this is the best comment I could have asked for. Just got done filling out my request for the DOR (: very helpful 
 Aww I'm glad I could help! :)
