Founded by Army Vet, Tankchair Makes All-Terrain Wheelchairs  These wheelchairs seem great, but what are you going to do when that custom motor blows out? Motors for normal wheelchairs cost approximately $1,000.00 each.  I can only imagine how much it would cost for a replacement motor and also to install that motor. In addition, I'm not sure that a standard wheelchair technician would be able to do repairs on a chair like this. 

 Aha, well, this all happens after step one of my plan - winning the lottery. I'll just hire a permanent technician. :)

But I get your point; I'm using a manual, and will continue to do so as long as I physically can - and the cost of one of those breaking doesn't bear thinking about.

However, with the "tank chair" you'd never hear, "oh I'm sorry, I didn't see you there". Ever.
