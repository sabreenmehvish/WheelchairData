Any bags large enough to hold walkers? For electric wheelchairs Hello!

My grandma uses an electric wheelchair outdoors but also likes to bring her walker along with her incase she decides to get up and take a leisurely stroll around. Does anybody know of any bags that can be strapped to the back of the electric wheelchair large enough to carry a walker? Thanks! I'd look into a hook and bungee, or some kind of strap to attach it to the back and keep it from swinging (and clanking)
