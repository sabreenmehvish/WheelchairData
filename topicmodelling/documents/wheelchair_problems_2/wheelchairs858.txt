The anti-wheelchair...  I really hate this supposed story. This glorifies walking as the one and only means of locomotion. A wheelchair is a far more impressive and useful piece of technology. This is DOD related propaganda.  I dunno, I could walk everywhere but prefer to get taxis any distance greater than 500m. Even then most days I can't be assed walking. Such a chore lol.
