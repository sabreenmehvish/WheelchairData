Question about a door that was to small for me to fit through. Hello! My name is Cyrus. A year and a half ago I was in an auto accident that left me using a wheelchair to get around. When I arrived home, We found that the door to my room was BARELY wide enough for me to get through. This was fine of course until I received the news I would be getting a custom wheelchair that is a bit wider. To accommodate the difference, We removed the frame and stud from one side of the door, making it wide enough for me to pass through unhindered. My question is, What options do I have to close this space off? Short of putting two nails in each corner and hanging a blanket, I'm afraid I don't have a clue? I cant compromise the width, but I was hoping that maybe there was some kind of bi fold door or sound dampening material I could use to keep the rest of the house out of my quiet space.


Any suggestions would be appreciated. It is basically a 30 inch wide, 80 inch tall hole in a wall that I would need to be able to travel through. I understand you may not be carpenters, but maybe someone with a similar experience can share their solution.2 You can get doors in whatever size you need. Some sizes will need to be custom ordered but you can still get them. It would be good to talk with a contractor to reframe the door and have a new door installed. It will cost a little bit but it would be good to have a real door.  Offset hinges might solve your problem.
