Roho seat Roho seat users do you find your seat starts to smell like sweaty hockey equipment. What do you use to keep it clean and smelling fresh. I've tried febreeze and bounce sheets. Just wondering if there's a better option.  You have to wash the cover and wipe the cushion down with bleach or something antibacterial regularly.  I don’t wash mine very often but I do wipe it down with a neoprene cleaner for scuba gear called mirazyme.   I also put some in a spray bottle and use that periodically.   It takes a couple of days to completely work but it does work quite well.   If it gets really nasty I wash it in the Mirazyme and let it air dry.  You can buy it on amazon and one bottle lasts for a very long time.  The bottle I’m using is over 6 years old and there’s still a lot in it Thanks, was hoping for something easier but figured it may come down to that.  That's a great idea. Thanks!
