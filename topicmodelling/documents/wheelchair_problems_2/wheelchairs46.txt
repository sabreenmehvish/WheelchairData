switching from rear wheel drive to front wheel drive.suggestions? so I'm finally switching power chairs

I have an invacare dragon (its been about 9.5 years) I drive it well but found out that it doesn't suit my needs as well as I thought so I decided to go for a Permobil f3 , it looks better , has good suspension , and as a  rfront wheel drive chair I think it'll suits my lifestyle better( I use public transportation a lot and live in an apartment that while adapted is still harder to manoeuvre in than a house..

anyway can you give me some driving tips or share your personal experience changing drive systems?

thanks in advance If you can drive a rear wheel with no problems then mid and front should be no problem for you. They are much easier to navigate in small spaces. You will have to get use to making the turn around your knees and not around your hips. Backing up is a little bit harder because the casters are behind you so you wonâ€™t see what they are doing.  You will like the Permobil better and if you have needs that require you to be in a specific position (catheterization, transfers or pressure relief) ask you ATP to program the memory seating functions for you.  This!  Front wheel pulls you over and around rather than pushes. The biggest issue I see is people forgetting about the rear end and take out tables, doors, etc.
