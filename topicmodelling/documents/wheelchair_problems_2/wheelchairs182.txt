Wheelchair Accessible Experiences in London Hi all ðŸ‘‹ We've been working on creating a place to find all kind of workshops and experiences in London (pottery, painting, coffee tasting, etc), and now we are doing a big focus on wheelchair accessible workshops. 

If anyone is interested in getting crafty and trying some workshops and you live in London, have a look at the link below. Very keen to hear what you think! ðŸ™‚

Thank you!

Would it be possible for you to publish the answers to the accessibility questions on the site? It'd be incredibly useful to know ahead of time about alternative entrances, parking and lift sizes to help people make better informed decisions. Thank you for letting us know your thoughts! Will bring this up with the team! At the moment, they simply have to answer 'Yes' to all, for it to be wheelchair friendly.
