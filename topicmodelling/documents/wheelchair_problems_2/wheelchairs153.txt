Wheel Chair Engineering Project Question? Hey wheelchair community, I have a couple of questions. We are doing this engineering competition at school where you have to build a device to hold supplies. What are some things that you guys would need to be held by your side for fast convenience to grab. Also are there any extra things that you guys would find helpful. Currently we have a cup holder, pencil holder, and phone holder with a charging dock. What about something that can hold an AAC(augmented communication device) in front to communicate but can be folded away when you are not using it.   The other issue I have run across is wheelchair users in college trying to find a carrier/backpack for their textbooks and notebooks.  The books would need to be easily reachable from a seated position.    Wallet/keys maybe? 

And for wheelchair-using parents, something to facilitate kids climbing into/sitting in the lap.  And baby wipes! Laptop, Camel Pack water container, Phone, medications, some people like to use large urine bags and it would be nice to hide it away
 Are you perhaps looking for a hard-shell case ??
I have made a (re-designed) soft bag for a Quantum Edge that folds up (in thirds) and stows under the seat. It opens and provides enough cargo room to do fairly heavy shopping (3 grocery bags) as well as the tablets, phone and other crap I carry with me. 
I bought it from Goodwill, cut and resewed the straps and cross-tied it to the back bar (arm support/swivel point)
It was simple. Opps sorry, I replied thinking this was a different post.   I don't really have a need for the product but it sounds neat.  I was just suggesting things he could design.    While your design might be great for some users, it probably would not work well for those with fine motor issues who can't hold their device and use it at the same time.   They would need something like a goose neck mount that could be stowed away easily on the wheelchair when not in use.
