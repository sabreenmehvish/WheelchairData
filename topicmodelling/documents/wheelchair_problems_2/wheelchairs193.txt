Which fast tyres do you recommend for use on a manual chair for general tarmac + carpet, plus a tiny bit of grass and mud? My wheels have no tread left on them and I'm sliding all over the place. 

I've had them since I bought the chair (Schwalbe Marathon Plus) and I thought I'd check if that's the best option to replace them with.

I work in an office so my commute is across tarmac and carpets, plus a few grass verges which I often slide about on at the moment. I love to go as fast as I can to feel the wind in my face (in truth it's not very fast at all haha), and I love the feel of a good grip where the chair is reactive and can corner hard.

Should I go with the same tyres again, or would a different one of the Schwalbe range suit my needs better - or is there a better brand which isn't too expensive which I could go fast on, without getting stuck in mud when I go over occasional grass verges?

Thanks :) I've been in a chair for just 8 years and so I haven't tried too many different types but I've always favoured the Schwalbe Marathon Plus. I haven't seen or heard of anything better. Also been using marathons for eight years. Getting a new set put on my wheels as we speak.  I agree and use the Marathon + as my daily tire. I did put a pair of Primo sentinel's on my backup wheels and they seem ok. Pretty much a knock-off but a smidge cheaper. I don't have long term reliability data for you though. Marathon +, ftw the one thing I love about the marathon plus is the puncture protection, if there's any chance of you running over glass or thumb tacks/push pins, I wouldn't want anything else.
