Does anyone know where to pick up this "Ferrari" electric wheelchair??  Probably custom made, honestly. I've never seen one before and doubt Ferrari would actually make them.  It looks to be a Quickie QM 710 with decals.  My thoughts were a custom sticker/decal or paint job. The wheelchair (or what we can see of it) looks pretty standard to me.
