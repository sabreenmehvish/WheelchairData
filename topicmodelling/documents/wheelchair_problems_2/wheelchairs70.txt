3D-printed wheelchair tailor-made for the perfect fit  Although a cool concept none of the chair users I know myself included would use the chair as it currently is. Does not appear to be able to be collapsed there is no place to attach devices like a smart Drive there is no place to attach leg straps and it does not seem conducive to having push handles, or for being strapped into a bus or train. Also because it appears to be made of plastic I know how banged around my chair gets I would be afraid of that one breaking which with what the cost of a wheelchair is would not be something I'd want to put up with being constantly afraid of breaking a $5,000 device with normal use. Really would love to see the idea more flushed out in a bit more input from wheelchair users in its design. I agree. It's a cool idea, but not perfect. Don't forget that at this stage it's only a prototype. A lot of changes will be made if it ever enters full scale production. I would be excited to see the 3d printing integrated into other devices such as sit skis and sports wheelchairs If it could be 3D printed in plastic, then it should be able to be printed in titanium or other materials Fair point.
