Grandma'a Pride and Joy Hey guys, recently I've been making a guide with centralized information (list of buyers, types of chairs, etc.) and I wanted to see how you guys like me doing this.

&#x200B;

I'm giving it a try with the chair we purchased for my 94 year old grandmother from [www.scootersnchairs.com](https://www.scootersnchairs.com).

&#x200B;

Anyway, the chair we got her is called the  Pride Jazzy Passport Power Chair. We received it via delivery, and she is already using it happilly. I know the price seems pretty steep, but so far we think it worth it given her noticeable improved mood since receiving the chair. If you have a chance, I highly recommend it.

It's around 60 pounds and is made by a company called Pride, but I have been having some difficulty digging up more direct information about their organization.

What do you guys think? Well, I'm not sure we're your intended audience. There's a difference between buying your elderly family member a wheelchair, and being a user that has a handicap which necessitates the use of one (probably daily, all-day use). It seems like your audience would be more akin to the "very light user" or "caregiver" side of things, whereas I've always perceived this sub to mostly be made of "those reliant upon wheelchairs." Perhaps you could show what you’re doing, it’s hard to judge without knowing what you’re talking about? What do you mean by list of buyers?  This is a link to the chair on Pride Mobility's site, however, you should be aware that this chair was likely not manufactured by them, only tweaked and re-branded, as I have seem some extremely similar designs while hunting for a travel power wheelchair lately.
