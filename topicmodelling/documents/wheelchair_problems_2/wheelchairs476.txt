Transforming How We Collect and Visualize Information about Urban Accessibility We are computer scientists studying how crowdsourcing, computer vision, and machine learning can be used to transform urban accessibility. Last year, we launched a beta tool called [Project Sidewalk](http://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu/?referrer=reddit_followup2), which enables users to virtually walk through cities to locate, label, and assess sidewalk accessibility. In our first pilot city, our users have mapped and assessed over 1,031 miles of Washington DC sidewalks—that’s 95% of the city and nearly the distance from DC to Miami. 

We need your help to get to 100%! Visit [http://projectsidewalk.io](http://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu/?referrer=reddit_followup2) from your laptop or desktop, click on Start Mapping, and begin virtually walking down DC streets to label and assess sidewalk quality issues. Even completing just one or two missions can make a significant impact. It's fast, it's easy, it's important. [This 60-second video](https://youtu.be/YZZK9mcH4Hc) shows you how.

Project Sidewalk data is used to model and predict sidewalk problems using machine learning, build new types of sidewalk-oriented maps and routing interfaces, and track urban accessibility over time. All of our tools and data are open source. See [projectsidewalk.io/api](http://projectsidewalk.io/api) for details. We'd love to hear from you if you're interested in building new mapping tools with our data or using our data in your research.

You can also help out by sharing this post with your colleagues, family, and friends and encouraging them to participate.

It's a frustrating interface to use. I'm a former c.e. drafter and ped advocate. Make a tool for a CITY to use in assessing these things. Crowdsourcing our civil rights is the wrong direction.
