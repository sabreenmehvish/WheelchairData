Searching for a Segway wheelchair  I was recently at IKEA in St. Louis and saw this Segway wheelchair. I went up to them to ask about his wheelchair and the dad told me he makes them. I gave him my contact information and he sent me a text. Unfortunately, my phone had a glitch and I lost their contact info. I am in need of a new scooter/wheelchair and would love to get in contact with these two. I'm hoping this will get back to them. I'm the guy that gawked in amazement at IKEA. Looks like the ALLY chair- I think I saw one a few years ago at the Chicago Abilities Expo?

-Some google-fu later and I found these:

Hope it works out for ya, they look pretty nice! Google the iBot. It was a wheelchair actually designed by Dean Kamen with the Segway technology, and manufactured by Johnson & Johnson for awhile, but not any more. 

It has 2 sets of powered wheels so it could climb stairs easily so it's a far better wheelchair than these home-made ones from the hacked Segways.
It was fantastic but too expensive to stay in production. This is likely the Ally. 

Rumor has it that Toyota has resurrected the iBot though, and is sponsoring its path to FDA approval. Yay!
