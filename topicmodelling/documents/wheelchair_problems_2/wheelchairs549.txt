Wheelchair is getting old... (and so am I!) I've been reading up on mobility scooters.  http://www.totrf.com/scooter/articles/mobility-scooter/  It will be at least a year until my injury properly heals and I'm badly wanting to upgrade.  Anyone else trying to do the same thing?  How is your search coming along? We use both, do you have any specific questions?
 Why still have both? If we are going a short distance once we get there, say in a restaurant. Or if there are a few steps it is easier to take the  chair up the steps. We had more use of the chair in NYC than in L.A.
