Our community abused the privilege at Disney parks prompting a change in policy. Your thoughts The time when Disney guests with disabilities were allowed to skip ahead of queues at park rides is a thing of the past. a few months ago, a reporter did a write up on some companies hiring people with disabilities as guides, for families willing to pay top dollar for a chance to avoid the lines. Families were found to be paying thousands of $ for this service. 
The expose caught the deserved attention of the internet and prompted Disney parks to review their policies and eventually change their policies in the matter. 
As of last week, Disney has implemented a new policy. Guests with disabilities will be required to check-in to a ride, and a a spot will be reserved for them in the queue. Guests will be asked to return at a time comparable to wait time in that respective queue. 

It is sad that members of our own community have abused the honor system of the original policy. 

What are your thoughts??? [deleted] No you're fucking bullshit, it was a great idea and some cunt screwed it all up. Now I have to smash my daughters legs to bits just to "work the system", who's the real monster here?, the fuckers who exposed it, that's who!. I've tried almost everyday to take a hammer to her legs and I can't do it, so now I have to take a pound hammer to her lower back instead, should be a shorter, shall we say "operation". It's ok thought she has severe Down's syndrome so genetically she doesn't seem to matter, well not to me and the wife anyway lol. Oh and ALL moments of able bodied people's life's are significant because they ARE ABLE BODIED. Besides you guys are lazing, sitting around all day. Fuck sake. Take a leaf out of the quadriplegic guys book, that I read about on here. He started off working as a door stop in Walmart and now he gets used to scoot small objects from a to b. That sounds like someone is climbing the corporate ladder!
