Cushions and Seat Covers? So, my PowerChair is hardly a full blown wheelchair like most of you might have but it is all I need for now so it is all my insurance will pay for. It works great but the seat is  a little uncomfortable after a while. I am looking to get a gel cushion for it and then I was thinking of covering the whole thing with a seat cover to help keep it in place. My question is, is there a place to get a seat cover for a power chair? The seat is basically like a car seat but the back is not nearly as high. It is a Jazzy Elite ES Portable (though we do not take it apart) power chair if that helps narrow down the options.

I looked at their accessories page and could not find any seat covers that they make for it specifically.

Any help is appreciated. [This website](http://www.pimpmychair.com/wheelchair-seat-cushion-cover/) does custom covers. You just have to select "power chair" on the size drop down and follow the other instructions for custom sizing below. Sorry I am late in commenting. 

A option that has not been brought up would be to ask your provider if your insurance would cover a rehab seat and cushion. Have them show you the options and see if that would work better for you.  Thanks. The patterns you have to choose from are really out there. I was just looking for something basic. I'll contact them to see if they can do something in a solid color.  I was also going to suggest PMC. I've ordered thing a from them (like gloves!) and they're great. 

OP, I bet they'd work with you on something simple.
