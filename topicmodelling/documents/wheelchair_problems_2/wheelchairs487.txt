Good front wheels for manual chair (TiLite TRA) I got my TiLite back in April and since I'm a part-time user, it's taking me a while to work out all of the kinks.  I realized that I need better front wheels (casters? is that what they're called?).  I have the generic little plasticy/rubber ones and they get stuck in every crack/dip/bump in the sidewalk.  My wheelchair vendor is a nightmare so I'm willing to pay out of pocket to get them, does anyone have any recommendations?  I would like to start using my chair for more outdoorsy adventuring, so I think I need something sturdy and shock absorbing.  Thanks in advance! frog leg casters, best kinetic dampening hands down. i think they even have treaded casters for off road now  Give wide, soft-roll tires a try.

Frog-leg casters can also potentially give you a smoother ride, but they are a bit pricey.  I'm using these on my Aero-Z. You have buy 8, but the price is good. You want 78a in hardness because it will give you some shock absorption.

I don't like the way they've designed the spacers (get spacers from a board shop), so you probably want to get some of those, and some bolts unless you have no problems with the stock bolts.

You may need bearings, too, unless can get them out of the stock wheels (I can't). Board shops have these, too. Just get the cheap ones. You're not skating.

In case the link doesn't work, they're Blue Bellies 8 Inline Skate Wheels 76mm 78a, Clear/Blue. $19.44 at Amazon. 

Sorry if some of this is redundant--you may already know a lot of it.
