What do you do for exercise?  All depends on injury level, very subjective. Handcycle. If it's a possibility for you, give it a shot. The freedom is amazing!  My local county hospital has a Fitness Center. It caters to the silver haired crowd, which is great for being in a chair. All the equipment has room to manuever around, and all of the seats are extra wide so transfering is really easy. It serves as their outpatuent rehab as well, so I can go work on the parallel bars whenever they aren't in use. They also have a pool with a chair lift.

As far as rouitine, I stretch on an elevated mat, then alternate lower and upper body. I don't have much leg strength, but can do leg press, curl, and extension on very low weight. Upper body is pretty much everything but bench press. I finish with a parallel bar session. If I want cardio, they have several hand cycles.

The cool part is by volunteering once a week at the hospital that owns it, I get to go for free. Wheeling is exercise :) dancing whenever the mood strikes or music is right also swimming and yoga, Hope to get back to get back to pilates, weight training, and bellydancing. 
 Handcycle. 


95% indoors, because it's easier than hauling the bike through my building, out to my car, installing the bike rack, loading it up, driving somewhere, unpacking and doing the same in reverse after my ride. 




5% outdoors because it's way more fun I have a [EasyGlide](https://easystand.com/product/glider-large/) thats pretty good. Other than that I go to a therapist twice a week, and I'm in the ICSCI at Kennedy Krieger. I go to the local mall and race around for a few hours, scaring the pedestrians and waving at all the other chair users. Think of it as alternative running/jogging.

(I have a manual chair.)
