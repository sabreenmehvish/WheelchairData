Smartdrive MX2 Clicking Noise I just got my new TiLite Aero Z and Smartdrive MX2 today. A few hours into zooming around with the smart drive, it started to make this clicking noise. It seems to be coming from the wheel itself and happens whether its on or off. Any tips? I'm calling the dealer tomorrow. Thanks!
