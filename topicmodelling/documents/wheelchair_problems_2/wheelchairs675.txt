Need info on wheelchair accessible appliances. Looking for models and makes of stoves with low cook surface (under 32") available in Canada. I assume such a beast exists. If you use a separate countertop range, you can make it whatever height you build your cabinets to. I don't have anything yet, but something I was considering for whenever I bought a place I actually cared to renovate was an induction stovetop. They have pretty slim profiles, and should drop into a countertop pretty easily. More than anything, look for one with the stove buttons on the front instead of the back wall. One thing you can also do is hang a mirror on the vent angled at 45 degrees to look down into tall pots. Looking for an electric range that is 23" (or so) deep and under 32" tall (30" would be ideal). I've tried to find specific makes and models that fit the bill but with no luck. Figured folks who have built accessible kitchens might be able to tell me where I could find such a short stove or what makes and models I should look into. The house we used to live in had a sufficiently short stove. Not sure what the make or model was. Yep, this is a great idea, assuming that you own your home. I'm building currently and did a wall oven and a seperate cook top that is empty underneath so that I can roll right up to the cooktop.
 My wife uses a mirror like this and it works great.
