Would really appreciate any advice for a power wheelchair for my dad Hey there.

I'm new to this sub, so apologies in advance if I break any rules!

My dad suffers from a very strange condition that was initially diagnosed as ALS, however evolution turned out to be much, much slower than ALS \(they gave him 3 years of life... around 10 years ago :D\). Doctors really have no idea of what he may have \(they keep doing tests\). All they can say is it looks like some variant of ALS, but evolution is extremely slow.

Bottom line is, he's mostly functional \(eats just fine, washes himself, etc.\), but degradation over the past few months means he can't really walk anymore. He gets around the house using [one of these](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1quAcKXXXXXXJXXXXq6xXFXXXr/medical-foldable-walking-aid-mobility-walker-with.jpg), but we all agree it's time for him get a wheelchair, especially so he can leave the house from time to time... or else my mum will go crazy :\)

They've been looking at power wheelchairs and they have shortlisted a couple of models, but I have no idea if these are good or bad and I can't find much info online.

We're in Spain, but I don't really know if wheelchair models are usually the same across countries or if manufacturers and models are different in each region.

Could anyone plase look into them and let me know your opinion/thoughts?

* My dad's favorite: [Mistral 7](https://www.accessiblemadrid.com/en/accesorios/libercar-mistral-7)
* Another option: [Quirumed D09](https://www.quirumed.com/en/ultralight-folding-electric-wheelchair-quirumed-d09.html)

As said, we're in Spain so these wheelchairs are available from Spanish online retailers \(I found English links for you\). I'm not sure if these models are also available abroad, maybe even sold under a different brand/name.

All in all, he likes the Mistral 7 due to its compact size, being portable and also having the batteries integrated into the support bars, which seems more convenient.

Any advice about these models? Any others you can recommend?

Thanks in advance for any help! I’m unfamiliar with both of these brands, but I do own one similar calle3d a smart chair. One of the great things about this type of chair is that it folds up and it is relatively light for a power chair. I only use mine for traveling – domestically here in the US and internationally. In fact, I used it in Spain recently. I would say The likelihood that these are super comfortable to be in for many hours during the day is pretty low. Mine is not, but I tough it out because it’s worth it traveling. I would see if there’s a way that you can contact a dealer and he can try out both of them.
