We are a university senior design team working on a wheelchair attachment that climbs curbs. Help us out, take our survey. Hi Reddit,

We're a group of engineering students from the University of Wisconsin Madison.  For our senior design project, we've been tasked with designing a retrofit attachment for manual wheelchairs that will allow them to easily climb a curb or single step.  

Though other designs for curb-climbing wheelchair attachments exist, they're bulky or difficult to use.  We're hoping for a compact and elegant design that meets the needs of a wheelchair user.  

We've put together a survey on [survey monkey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7KJ89CR), in order to answer some of our basic questions.  We'd also welcome feedback from the community here, as to what you would want out of a product of this nature.  

Thanks,
Madison's Team Wheelchair [deleted] There is a college design challenge competition for assistive technology you should know about that could win you up to $25,000.  a1designchallenge.org  My fianc√© has an ibot, it does take curbs...I am directing him towards your survey.  I've just been too scared to try curbs... Lol, thought you wrote he is an ibot, which is a new way of saying a cripple Start at home with a small wood block. Get used to popping your front wheels up enough to clear. Then move on to the back wheels. Once you have the have of that move outside. It's easier to overcome the nervousness of you can tip over at home a few times.
