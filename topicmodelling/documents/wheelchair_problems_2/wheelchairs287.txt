I want 4 of the 9 listed here. how about you? Do you knw these products exist?  Iâ€™ve personally tried the Widjits a few times and they are pretty cool.  They are kind of hard to get insurance to pay for though, you need a really applicable diagnosis to get them.  The grade aids work great too and they are pretty cheap as far as wheelchair parts go.  

Edit: Do not put anything like the CARE-E On on your chair.  It will void any warranty that you might have on the chair.   i tried widgets as well and I did not know about the braking system...ran into someone at an expo!!! no harm done though.
Thanks for the heads up on the CARE-E and similar systems
