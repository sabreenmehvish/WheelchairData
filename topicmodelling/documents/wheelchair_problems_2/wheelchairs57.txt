Hi! I'm Part of A Studio Creating A Game Starring A Character In A Wheelchair. Tell Me Your Opinions On Representation. (x-post from /r/disabled) As the title says, I'm part of a studio creating a game surrounding a character who's been using a wheelchair for most of their life. I'll be the main writer of the story for this game. I'm a guy who has not been in a wheelchair in their life, almost ever. I don't presume I can write a realistic perspective for this part of this character. Not without a bunch of research. But I do know I can treat this aspect of the character as a practice in greater representation, which I think can be positive, so I've come here for all your lovely opinions and experiences. 

What characters using wheelchairs in TV/shows/games/books have you liked? Which have you hated? What would you like to see done differently or would be interesting or possibly create a positive impact? What little touches might lend some authority to this aspect of the character?

Seeing as this is also a work of fiction in a game, would it be offensive to you to have something like a mechanic involving/factoring in their disability? i.e. A customized battle equipped chair or just simple wheelchair style movement controls. We're not looking to make this character's game mechanic abilities completely based off their disability, but we would like to incorporate it into the experience in a meaningful/interesting/fun way.

Thanks in advance for your help! Feel free to correct my language, rant, make book suggestions, link me to blogs, ask questions, whatever. I'm here to learn, listen, and make sure I get it right.

**EDIT:** Just moving random words around. *shrugs*

**EDIT 2:** For those asking about the game, here's a little more detail for you: It's a VR horror game set in at least somewhat realistic setting in terms of character interactions. The world otherwise is fairly fictional and (still being decided) will have anywhere from traditional horror genre stuff to something leaning more towards contemporary horror styles like psych horror, comedy horror, or adventure horror. The MC will be a first person perspective character who navigates via their chair. Who they are and what kind of chair it is have yet to be decided. Beyond maneuvering through the world with the chair, the game will involve a few mechanics including the VR space, turn based RPG design, and exploration. Most of these details are pretty tentative, since we're still in pre-production. The general setting of the game currently is in a high school. 

**EDIT 3:** Oh wait. We could be canceled. So far I don't see anything wrong with your language :) I can't really make any suggestions for good media - I'm not a huge media consumer on the whole (though I am a gamer). I'm going to be writing this assuming you don't know much about the disabled, and I'm sorry if that's a very wrong assumption.

Without knowing the genre of your game, it's really hard to answer your question. I will say that as an initial reaction, the whole "battlechair" thing seems kinda gimmicky. Like, that's the sort of thing everyone jokes about *already* ("lol will your new chair have lazers?") so it just seems... not offensive at all, but like the obvious answer? Kind of childish, too. That's not to say it can't be done well, but I think it will be hard to pull off. You're more than willing to try, because like I said it's not offensive - IMO.

Now, wheelchair *movement* - by all means! I don't think anything here is particularly off-limits, and with the way chairs are made now, they're pretty maneuverable. I imagine they'd be sort of similar to how one controls bicycles in game, programmer/engine wise? (Yeah, idk.) I think, if realism if your goal here, you may consider trying out a wheelchair IRL to see what you can do. At the least, maybe a lot of YouTube vids. I find most people generally underestimate chairs, because I've freaked out more people by going on like grass without thinking, or down a hill fast -_- (I am solely a powerchair user, though.)

Personality-wise, and social-wise, this is where you'll have to tread semi-carefully. You're of course able to do anything - it's your story. But just try to avoid some tropes. Two of the biggest ones: bitter cripple who hates everything and can't come to terms with how crippled he is, and/or inspiration porn fodder who finds out he's \~capable of anything~. (By the way, look up **"inspiration porn"** and avoid doing that.) I'm sure there's more tropes, but I think these two annoy the majority. Speaking broadly, treat this character as a human and you'll be fine. Like... Imagine your best friend, and now imagine them slightly different because they have to sit down all the time. That's it. You'd still talk the same way with them, you'd still make off-color jokes, you'd still share intimate details of life, but you'd have to remember to avoid stairs. I imagine that's how most disabled people want to be treated (I know I do). In your game, you can make cripple jokes, but usually the character *has to be in on it* to have them be funny.

If you want to make a social statement, consider adding in some discrimination from NPCs (or even from the environment). A lot of people get uncomfortable when I compare ableism to racism, but it's not that different at the core of it. Or, maybe, you might consider the discrimination the "mutants" of the Marvel universe face? (If I understand that universe, of course; I might not.) Personally, I'd find this topic refreshing to be at least poked at, as so many people always brush it under the rug as a matter of fact that disabled people are "lesser" or "disgusting" or "not worth the resources." You might have good results researching the **"social model of disability,"** too, as this is a big facet of both discrimination and how people might view themselves.

Anyway this is a bit rambly, sorry! Hope I helped at least a little. Randomly the character should suddenly stop, becuase they ran into a small rock, electrical cord, or piece of dog food, with a front wheel. Lol Don't... don't do that.  [deleted] For the love of god, do NOT make their arc as a character about "overcoming" disablity. Stay away from dehumanizing them by making them solely an "inspirational figure." Just write them as a normal, well rounded character  I'm late to this thread so people have already brought up great, more nuanced points. But I have a really simple one that comes to mind almost EVERY TIME I see attempts at representing wheelchair users in media! Whenever it happens, I immediately discredit the attempt at representation and mutter dark things about "propagating false stereotypes of infirmity" (lol).

Anyway, my suggestion is: if your character is an active, full time manual wheelchair user, they do NOT use a bulky oldschool medical wheelchair like [this](http://www.spinlife.com/Drive-Medical-Cruiser-III-Lightweight-Wheelchair/spec.cfm?productID=91350&adv=googlepla&utm_medium=CSE&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D-%7Bmatchtype%7D&utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&utm_source=googlepla&default=1). Those are for hospitals or rentals for people who broke a leg or something.  Chairs like [this](http://www.tilite.com/chairs_aerot.php) are more accurate.

Good luck, happy to hear about your plan! Two more things I thought of:

1. If you're going to try a chair for yourself, do not assume that your generic "[hospital wheelchair](http://atwiki.assistivetech.net/images/thumb/4/4c/Hospital_wheelchair.jpg/180px-Hospital_wheelchair.jpg)" is typical of the experience. Those are very poorly-made, non-customized chairs, which result in not being able to navigate one's environment effectively. Someone who is in a wheelchair full-time is almost always going to have a customized chair - or at the very least, a well-made one. (Common brands: [TiLite](http://www.tilite.com/) for manuals, [Permobil](http://www.permobilus.com/wheelchairs.php) for powered.)

2. Decent media example I've remembered is [Nina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fringe_characters#Nina_Sharp) in Season 5 of Fringe. I liked the way they portrayed this character as having total autonomy and being capable of doing things *in the chair while moving*. It's weirdly common to have characters not move while doing activities. (Like, an able-bodied person can pick up something off a table while walking, and so can some people in a chair [assuming arm strength allows].) Lol made me laugh for sure. I would love to see a character swearing at their front wheels like I do because they get in the way of EVERYTHING!! I would disagree with the whole bumping down a kerb thing. I've been using a chair for 3.5 years and can't, but I do have major issues with my arms. I guess I'm Googling " Jude Law Woody Harrelson Wheelchair Movie" today. I'll let you know if I figure out the title.

I'll take a  look at that manual for sure. Very likely to be helpful. Especially for designing the environments. I've been wondering how realistic our impression of un/accessible spaces should be. We don't want to restrict the maneuvering of a player in a game so much that they feel somehow bullied by design, but I think it would be cool and valuable if we can accurately represent some of the day-to-day concepts of moving through the world in this different way. 

Updated the OP to involve a description of the basic game now. I got you covered there. Last thing I want or want to write. There was a moment I had to knock down someone's idea who was headed in this direction. So far it's been smooth sailing. The character's identity is shaping up to be a young adult girl with a violent past. I dunno if she is punk yet or not, but people seem to assume she is.

Also, the project has run into trouble and may be canceled. Which sucks. The story was actually getting pretty cool. Hm. All this is really helpful advice. Never seen a single episode of Fringe, but I'll check out a good Nina episode for sure.

What's the experience of getting a customized wheel chair like? As far as cost/finances, is it common that people are paying for part of their care with benefits from the AWDA and such? 

I'm pinging the boss man about how many beans I can spill about the game. If beans I can spill, I'll let you know.

EDIT: Yup. Got permission. I'll add specifics to the OP. [deleted] [deleted] Thank you! I love the idea of a badass punk young adult girl. I really hope it isn't canceled, it sounds like a really good project Oh, interesting genre choice! Have to admit I'd play anything except horror, but then I'm probably a minority in that regard xD

Here's one suggestion: what about a service dog? It could be a "weapon" of sorts. And some sort of gun mount done minimally wouldn't be that bad... I imagine many people have these mounts for hunting/shooting IRL? It would be hard to make both overly believable. I think what I would do is convert another mount (for, say, a tablet) into a gun mount, either by another character or in a very haphazard way by the char themselves.

Hm... I'm probably not the best person to ask about getting a chair. I'm in a power chair but I'm actually pretty "easy" in terms of seating, mostly because I can shift my own weight and such. I gather that more severely affected people often go in for a "customized seating evaluation" which can last a while or over a few appointments, and can be involved in some cases. However, I don't think any of this would be visible to the player, kinda like how you don't show exactly how you scrunch up a pillow when you sleep :P You might be interested to look at what "accessories" chairs can have. I don't have any, but there's several out there, and they're more common in powerchairs.

Paying for a chair obviously varies a hell of a lot. Myself, I have one private and one public insurance, and between them the immense cost (think over $40k) of a powerchair is covered without me having to pay for them. I think there's a large population in manual chairs who have to pay out of pocket! It mostly comes down to if you can "justify" it to insurance, if you have insurance - they won't pay for one if you don't need one in the house (yes it's as dumb as it sounds), and they'll only pay for the minimum of what you need. So I think - although I can't confirm - manual users end up paying for the "good stuff" because they're "not as bad off," whereas with power chair users it can be very visible what they need. (Though, again, insurance always pays minimum; I didn't even know customized seating existed to the extent it did until last year!)

In both instances, you do (or should, in most circumstances) get the privilege of trying out before you buy. *And you get to pick the color of it!!* Anyway it's kinda like a new car, don't sign for it until you're happy with it.

PS: As for Fringe, it's not the best series. Still... I suppose the suicide ep could work for your purposes if you have to pick one. I usually loathe the whole "kill the crip" angle shows do, and I'm usually very upset by many "right to die" stuff, but Nina showed that she was her own person, not ashamed of herself, that her disability was not really part of the decision; it was, to me, as if anyone else in her position would do the same. (Well I prob wouldn't, my survival instinct is stupid strong, but I think you'll get it if you watch it.)

PPS: One thing powerchair users have to always keep in mind is their battery life. We usually get a "sixth sense" of how long our chairs can last on one charge... And personally, not having this sense in a new chair is unnerving. That might be a consideration if you have the character in a powerchair; it would be a very real addition. And while manual users need two hands to "steer," powerchairs only need one (note, it's default to use one's dominant hand on the joystick. I find this dumb as hell and use my non-dominant hand to drive.). It's true that manual chairs can be easier mobility-wise, especially for curbs and cars and that, but only if you have the strength to do so. 

Edit: Oh and I think you meant to say the ADA (not AWDA)? Afaik that has absolutely no grants or help tied to it, it's just a series of laws mainly regarding employment and building codes, reasonable accommodations, and I think education / mainstreaming. There are, however, numerous charities out there, but they're hard to find and vary based on location. Fair enough then, I've not seen Dark Angel after all. It seems that due to how certain VR companies are releasing their tech, that many people might only have one motion control. So now we're leaning towards a power chair simply because it would be hard to simulate the two handed movement of a manual chair with only one hand to input motion. According to a guide from ablegamers, this kind of implementation is 101 for making a game accessible anyway for people with more limited upper limb mobility. 

I think we'd like to include multiple control schemes, but the limited dev time we have will probably make us prioritize the one handed power chair movement for now.

Ideally I think I'd like the full game to have enough rebindable keys and design to allow both experiences, but it'll take some long term fiddling to figure that out.  Haha. I guess I'll count you in to everyone else who wants her to be punk. Either way I go she might read a little punk, just cus she's going to be rather violent. 

Also punx is dead! Oyoyoy! *spills PBR all over my head*



 Reporting back:

First off, project may be canceled.

Second. Watched that Fringe episode. As someone who has no clue what was going on in the story but picked things up, by the end I do get a sense of who Nina is and what she is fighting for. I noticed that her scenes are often her in a static position. Now that I think about it, for the most part what representation in media I recall, wheelchairs seem to be used as static objects like chairs. Except maybe for Scrubs? I'm sure there are exceptions, but I wonder if this is because the movement draws more attention to the chair, or maybe because it's a fairly large object visually that it changes the framing of the scene, or perhaps just because, at the end of the day, people stay in place half the time normally. It does make me think of a more active character though, which in an interactive medium like games, they would have to be.

I meant the ADA. You good.

You might/might've played this game. At least where we're at, we're trying to create a horror environment that is inviting to a lot of different palettes. It's not all jump scares and gore, though we won't/wouldn't have shied away from using them when effective. In that case if you're going modern powerchair you are best served modelling on the Permobil F5, or imagining their new M3 (maybe an M5) which is a F5 style build-up of their M300. See if you can speak to a local rep to demo one for a couple of hours.Main points are without anti tipper wheels the max climb height under perfect conditions is about 5", dropping to 3" under most conditions or with a mid wheel chair. Mid wheel chairs are easier to model steering of and common with brand new chairs. Rear wheel drive is popular mostly only among older users and Europeans, and is not much sold elsewhere.As for characters, I assume the Alex Cross stuff by James Patterson is one of your influences in the wider decision to do things?Might also be worth watching some powerchair football and hockey and rugby so you can get an idea of what these chairs are capable of when setup for something less sustainable. The Quickie P222SE is a standard powerchair that's often used as a cheap sports chair, but there's an option for the character to get his/her sports chair from gym storage for extra mowing of zombies etc..especially as it already as a cage on the front. Aww man, that sucks. I sincerely hope it's not cancelled, but I know how hard the video game system can be (vaguely, as a consumer). Definitely would've loved to see something come out of this but shit happens. You're probably right, I might've played it, as horror is a loose genre atm.

Thanks so much for updating, though! Most wouldn't have bothered. You're good people. Hm. You might've read in my other comment that the project may be canceled, but this is all sweet info I would/might hand off to people currently designing the movement. If we're not canceled.

One thing we've encountered is that with release many of these VR setups won't actually have the movement controllers, which means that we've had to prioritize a more standard Xbox-like controller you plug in to your laptop or whatever. Sucks, but that means we have to cut down on the realistic motion of the chair controls. We were/are still working on a realistic movement in game of the chair, but it won't feel quite as real since you don't have the analogue feedback of the movement controller.

I realize people think writers love James Patterson, but I've actually never read a single one of his books. Alex Cross sounds familiar, and I'll give it a look since you thought it was a reference worth mentioning. 

Oo. A cage at the front is neat. On the other hand I think we're really trying to move away from the battle chair concept and focus on the person in the chair as much as possible. For a second there we might've dipped into b-movie more prop language (ie Evil Dead) kind of storytelling, and we still might, but at least to start off we want someplace with a little more realism. Dr. Xavier has become my kind of lode stone in some ways, though watching Fringe I believe the kind of brain in a wheelchair is its own niche trope at this point, even if it is essentially a positive one.  I AM THE OP. I DELIVER! 

But seriously, thas nice. You're gonna get some internet tears flowing, my friend from across the binary void.

Yeah. Main problem is funding. As in we had it and now we don't. There's a chance that it's cleared up by next week. A slim slim chance. I'll update this post again if things turn out well.
