What stupid things have people said to you? I have asked if they can "pray" for me  LOL! Most of these have happened to me. Here's my favorite one: "Do you play basketball? 'Cause I've seen people in wheelchairs play basketball." We'll, I've seen people who can walk being presidents. What country are you the president of?
