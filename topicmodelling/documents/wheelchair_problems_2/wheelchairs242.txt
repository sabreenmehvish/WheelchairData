Used wheelchair cost?? Hello I am thinking of selling my old motorized wheelchair but I have no idea how much to sell if for. I have had for 6 years . I needs a new battery. What price should I put on it what brand and model is it Its a quantum Normally I work on a figure of (1/years)*.5 of my wheelchair cost minus battery cost if needing replaced or pro rata if not new,  so my $25k Permobil C500 went for $1500 with no longer new batteries (900km) in it when it was 9 years old. If it was 1 year old it'd have been half price,etc. Okay so if the original price was 15,000 and its 8 years old $500 if you're feeling generous, $900 for an average and $1500 if you're not? Because the expected life of a chair is 7-8 years,  they're basically worthless if the batteries are old after that.
