What features would you want to see on a manual wheelchair? Hey everybody,

I'm on a team of engineering students who have decided to do a wheelchair redesign. We're trying to find out what exactly to work on and would like some input as to what features you'd like to see on a manual wheelchair.

We've made a survey so that we can collect the data efficiently. Only the first question is required so answer as much or as little as you want. The more information we get, the better, so don't be shy!

Survey:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UKCxl5G75ludQA16ZWbKy6wJO1rJg4fPT5RofpRGVNs/viewform

Also, feel free to comment below as well. Thanks for taking the time and I look forward to working on this!
