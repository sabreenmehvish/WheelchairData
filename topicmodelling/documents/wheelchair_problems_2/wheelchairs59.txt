My new firefly from Rio Mobility!  Awesome! I've seen those on facebook a lot lately. How do you like it? Is it as much fun as it looks? That looks like fun! I want one. I love it! I saw it on facebook last year, and my town did a fundraiser for me to get it (it ISN'T covered by any government funding). It was very expensive, but well worth it. It can go up to 18km/h (12mph) speed wise, and 30km/h (18mph) distance wise.  Yea I figured it was pretty expensive and not covered, but it looks awesome. I'm glad you were able to get it. I'd love it for something like Burning Man. I have the [Freewheel adaption](https://www.gofreewheel.com/) and I Love it.
