Research of participants in Wheel Chairs  First time on Reddit.. seeking for help.

&#x200B;

Hello...  I am in the middle of doing my literature review about accessibility of  people in wheel chairs.. what I am trying to get across is..

&#x200B;

How does people get through life on a day to day bases in a wheel chair.?

&#x200B;

Do you need help from someone either in your home or outside?

&#x200B;

if its temporary or permanent.. how do you feel being in the wheel chair?

&#x200B;

do you believe more places should make it more clear.. were the ramps are.. or needing to put ramps for the handicap.?

&#x200B;

do you find yourself limited what you are able to do?

&#x200B;

any information will help me..

&#x200B;

I  know these questions seem concerning and I apologize if these questions  offend people but I am looking for a place to start to understand how  you feel and also to write up my research so I am looking for  participants.

Paul. SMA type 2, wheelchair bounds, got my first wheelchair when i was 2 years old. Feel free to send me a message with your questions I'm in self propelled, in my home I get about by myself, outside I need help more often than not.
The doctors are unsure at the moment whether or not I'll recover.
If there are ramps there I don't need much help in finding them. More easier ramps would be nice.
I'm definitely limited it's getting me down recently actually. I find it hard to get out my house since it's not suitable for a wheelchair, neither is my whole town, all the pavement is jagged and most of the ramps to get down roads are dangerous for me to do on my own.
