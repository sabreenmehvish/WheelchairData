Manual chair propelled by torso movement? I've been trying to find out whether any manual chairs exist that allow the user to propel it with their torso. I can't move my arms or legs much but I can move my torso forward, backwards, and side to side. The closest I have seen to what I'm thinking of are lever powered chairs but those would still need a good bit of modification to be usable without arms. Thanks in advance for any advice. So you mean u drive that way where your torso leans?

Edit:Word Could be. But also could be the torso movement provides the manual power and steering is handled separately.
