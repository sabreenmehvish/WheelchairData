Advice for traveling abroad with manual chair? Hey! I'm going to be traveling for a few months abroad and have a tilite aero z with a smart drive mx2. 

I'm looking for ideas of "essentials" to bring. I'm thinking a tire patch kit and spare valve covers? Any other ideas? 

Thank you!! Spoke wrench, allen wrench/screwdriver/multitool for whatever mounts your pushrim to your wheel. Throw in a couple of presta adapters as well, just in case someone has a presta only pump. An EXTRA power converter. Oh and a list of the Permobil dealers in whatever country you go to.   Power converter for charging your chair. May contact the chair company and ask them if they sell them. Also many countries have lots of bike shops, bike shops have the tools we would need to repair certain things, just as a backup plan if anything does happen.  If you have a roho then patches for that. 

Where are you off to?  I usually travel with a tyre and roho puncture repair kit and at least one spare inner tube. A couple of Allen keys and a spanner that fits the front casters.  Thank you so much!! Adding this to my list haha. Do you think my old bike multitool might work? Thanks! I'll give the company a call I'm off to Canada, then I may go see where else I can go after if all goes well Pretty much should. Happy travels. Thanks!
