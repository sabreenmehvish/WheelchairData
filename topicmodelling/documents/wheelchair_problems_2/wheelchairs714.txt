I have a Invacare PWC and I don't like it. My insurance is UHC. Does anyone know if they'll let me upgrade to a Permobil F5?  I don't know about your specific company, but many will only buy you a new one every 5 years. Sorry.  I am a former Rehab Specialist so I have first hand experience. 

Is your current Invacare over 5 years old or have you gained/lost a significant amount of weight or have you developed pressure sores?  I got it in 2013. I do not have pressure sores or anything. 

I asked my wheelchair vendor and they  told me that insurance would only pay for repairs unless the cost of repairs exceeded the cost of a new chair. I didn't like that answer. What they told you is the truth. Without a major change in condition or cost of repairs exceeding cost of replacement, insurance will not cover a new one until you hit the 5 year "expected lifetime" of the chair.  You can always buy out of pocket.  Though here in Australia the expected lifetime is 7 years. Never mind the snakes, scorpions, dust, salt etc. I could never afford that.
