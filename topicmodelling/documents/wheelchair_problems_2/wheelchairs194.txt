best road trips for limited mobility Hi all,

I currently use a wheelchair for longer distances but really hate using it for prolonged periods of time because my knees hurt when they're bent but when I straighten them my back really hurts. Anyway, I wanna go on a honeymoon this summer and want to go on a road trip in the west coast of Canada or the USA. I'm actually much more comfortable in a car where I can use a cushion wedge and wanna do a trip where lots of the natural beauty/sites are right near where you can park. for example, last summer we did a road trip on Highway 1 in California and it was perfect. Any tips on fun areas to road trip that are easily accessible by car/short distances on wheelchair? We esp. like nature sites.  Seattle and Washington state are one of the most accessible places in the 
US. Plenty of city and beautiful nature to enjoy plus you can pop up to Canada for more adventures. West Coast is a great suggestion. But if youâ€™ve been there done that, another fun option is a desert trip. Arizona is crazy accessible. Thanks, old people. Due to the high retiree population, Arizona parks are stellar in regards to accessibility. And expansive desert vistas are great for a road trip.

Utah also has amazing views! Get yourself to Zion National Park!
