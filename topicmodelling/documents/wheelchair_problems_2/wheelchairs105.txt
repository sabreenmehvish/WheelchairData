Use the Wii Fit on a Wheelchair! [This](http://www.lifelivelyactive.com/Pages/default.aspx) is a platform to allow people in wheelchairs to play games with the Wii Fit Balance Board.

It was designed by my dad and his friend, and is currently being sold from florida. They are $150 CDN + S/H, and are made in Port Coquitlam, BC, Canada.
