Suggestions on Wheelchairs that can do this in the USA? (Panthera X pictured from other post)  I can do this with my TiLite ZRA2 no problem. That wouldn't run nearly 7G. The hard part is getting the technique down. Hey all, saw the other post about the Panthera X and the ability to take apart and pull the chair into the car looks awesome and would be very useful.  Does anyone know how I can get this or something similar in the US without spending like 7 grand?

Thanks! Those pictures look like a Tilite Aero T.  Any of the Tilite rigid chairs will do what you are looking for. A lower budget chair would be the Ki Mobility Rouge or Tsunami. Tilite is a better known manufacture where Ki is a growing one.  The best thing to do would be to find a local Complex Rehab Provider and talk options with them.

I have fit my Ti-Lite ZRA in some pretty small cars when I take my wheels off [my friends and I have managed to fit 5 people and my wheelchair into a Kia Soul, and all our luggage, and go on an (admittedly uncomfortable) 10 hour roadtrip - I've also put it in Yarises and sedans]. 

Ti-Lites can be a bit up there, but I know someone with a Quickie 5R that can do this, I'm sure the other rigid Quickies can. When I got my TiLite I also tried out an Invacare crossfire that could do that. I hear that Ki mobility is a new rigid option out there now. as a wheelchair this is one of the reasons you spend 7000 on a wheelchair, but i understand. what youre looking for is a lightweight rigid chair, reasons so cost so much is because of what they are made out of. anyways check this site out, its legit, i bought my wheels through them.
