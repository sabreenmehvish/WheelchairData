Inside the new South Lake Union tiny house village -- Drug/alcohol use won’t be allowed in community spaces, but residents will be allowed to use inside their tiny homes as long as their behavior isn’t disruptive.  Wait... are we, regular folk, allowed to use drugs at home? I assume these are rigged for electricity, water, and sewage so they will be much cheaper to operate than the homeless camps that needed to rent portapotties, haul in water, etc.

But how will these be used to transition rather than just free permanent housing? If you're living in a shed in a parking lot I'd say your drug and alcohol use is already pretty disruptive.   I think they should only make these available to people who prove they are trying to get back onto their feet. Submit to random drug tests, provide proof they are searching for work, and maintain cleanliness of their area. If those conditions are met they get to keep their housing. That way the goal is to get them out of the tiny houses and into more livable affordable housing so these units can be used for others who want to better themselves. Just giving away handouts doesnt fix the homeless problem. It creates demand for homeless to live here and makes the problem worse.  Know how to kill addicts?  Give them sheds where they can do all the drugs they want with no accountability.  Furthermore, the issue in Licton Springs was not so much the use of drugs in common areas, it was the drug sales, crime, and prostitution which accompanied the use of drugs and are sure to show up here, too.

This is so embarrassingly ignorant that I wonder if there is another agenda at work here.  I honestly have trouble believing that we would continue to pursue this given its failed history. These will become filthy, and unlivable in no time. Sunk cost aside, next on the list is paying for weekly house cleaning and a butler. [deleted] Well this will fail some of the shittiest people in the world comment on threads like this. If you're gonna shame and dehumanize a person simply because they have a substance abuse problem you should probably just keep it to yourself.  Great. Human trafficking hubs. I’m getting a feeling like if tim burton directed district 9.  Does anyone know how we can donate blankets/furniture/home goods?  For me it's a no no to drugs, the [community](https://tinyhousecitizens.com/resources/parks-and-communities/) should help their drug-dependent neighbor for them to be able to get back on their normal lives again. r/whatcouldgowrong *scratches head* Is the title trying to be passive aggressive about how small the houses are? [removed] The shanty towns will allow shooting up. Great. This will be a good lesson to the uber progressive amaholes that move here and vote for leftists in our city.  If one is "Homeless" they get to possess and consume drugs without legal consequence. But, if I do, as I have a home, I get arrested for it. How it that "Legal"? If it is at all. I meant in Seattle, and I don’t see anything in there about it being low-barrier.  Also, that sounds like their first attempt and succeeded.  Seattle has already failed, and has no changes to their strategy.  What is different about Seattle’s new tiny house village that won’t repeat the failed one? S.L.U.t. house village ...  What criteria for disruptive and who is the decider? This sounds like my mom telling me to not have my high school party get to loud while she's out of town. Lol so no way our shitbag homeless use these.  You are alowed to drink and smoke cannabis in your home, yes. Probably not the drugs they are talking about but it counts. This is actually one of the favorite arguments supporters of this tiny village (which totally isn't low barrier /s) love to throw out, i.e. "nobody forbids you from doing heroin or meth in your house, why should we hold the homeless to a different standard?" It's a bad argument though since it's pretty standard for lease agreements to contain a clause that expressly forbids the resident or any guest from using illegal drugs on the property. Landlords typically don't want to be accessories to crimes committed by their tenants. It's very surprising to me that LIHI doesn't seem to think there is a risk in openly stating they are permitting their residents to abuse illegal drugs in buildings that, ultimately, LIHI is responsible for.  I mean I don't have any issues with it. This sounds like don't ask don't tell which is essentially how most well to do users handle it. Do you actually own the home?  who cares? > I assume these are rigged for electricity, water, and sewage

Dont know about electric but they dont have water or sewage

From the article: 

>>  Further back on the lot there’s a large kitchen tent with an industrial sink. A hygiene trailer with bathrooms, showers and hot water is also planned for the site.  You'd hope they'd have some good state funded job programs for them to bulk up their resumes, since getting a stable job when you don't have recent work can be pretty tough. I haven't heard of anything like that though. If anyone knows of one id love to hear details These are fully insulated houses with electricity....Not a shed Just to you, not necessarily to anybody else Nice insinuation that all homeless people are alcoholics and/or drug users. 

Guess what? They're not.

SOURCE: I am a formerly homeless veteran without a drug or alcohol problem.  Oddly, "housing the homeless" makes the problem better. Then what about the homeless that haven’t shown that inclination?  Do you prefer them to sleep on the sidewalk? Is a permanent shed not better than a tent on a median surrounded by trash? > Know how to kill addicts? Give them sheds where they can do all the drugs they want with no accountability. 

Yes, because they aren't already doing all the drugs they want with no accountability. Thankfully the Licton Springs village is closing in March. You are exactly right though, the problem isn't really that the residents are using drugs in their sheds, but that in order for them to do that the neighborhood has become overrun with drug dealers, prostitutes and other associated criminal elements. I live on the same street as Licton Springs, and I feel really sorry for the taxpaying citizens that will be living near this new camp. It's a practice run for similarly authoritarian rules for regular housing. Hate to say it but you’re 100% right. As far as I see it most wont be use this as a temporary housing to spring back on their feet.. Oh damn. Where is that at? Not to mention that not everyone is homeless initially because of a drug addiction. I'll bet for most it started as a mental health issue.
Happy, well-adjusted people don't usually take up heroin and become homeless. Everyone wants to blame drugs because that's the easiest culprit. Obviously drugs keep homeless people homeless but do people really think that's how most of them got there in the first place?
Maybe if we had readily available mental health services for adolescents and adults more people would be well-adjusted. People might get treatment they need before the nature of their condition prevents them from seeking treatment. Speaking on behalf of the heartless sociopath community, we have just as much right to express our views as anyone else. Shame on *you* for dehumanizing the empathy impaired.  Yeah, I'd rather have a whole city of drug addicts than tech boys wagging their fingers at everyone and I mean that sincerely.  Did you mean scumbag junkies? Yes, scumbag junkies should be dehumanized. Their habits cost everyone a lot of money and take up a lot of resources in our society that could be used to do actual good. 

You need to put that bleeding heart away there Mr. SJW.  >some of the shittiest people in the world comment on threads like this

Thanks for identifying yourself! Usually a resident can only stay in these for about a year and they are "owned" by their sponsor. So I don't know why you think that would happen?  "It seemed like a good idea at the time..." No, tiny house is a term used to describe minimalist living. There are even a few TV shows about people building tiny houses. You're truly the lowest level of worthless dickhead when you're actually championing genocide for the less fortunate. I hope you feel nothing but discomfort in Seattle and leave forever.  Yeah bro, because it's totally cannabis that's going to be used there. I mean, I see cannabis needles all over the city and there's just cannabis users destroying their lives all over the city.  IIRC it's illegal to smoke pot in your own home in Seattle. Others are held to a different standard as you have to, you know, work and pay rent and support yourself and not leach off of society.  The bank owns it... for now... not u? They do have electric. Source: I volunteered yesterday doing some interior trim work.  Hahahaha, yeah, they all want jobs. That's why they're allowing drugs because, you know, they all want jobs.  [San Diego](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/07/us/iyw-san-diego-homeless-workers-trnd/index.html) has a program like this, but generally, the chronically homeless are not too interested in jobs, or they would have accepted services already. Yes, shanties is a better description.  I have insulation and electricity but not running water or heat in my shed.  It doesn't make it a house though I get it, better than a tent or nothing at all. [deleted] Except who is paying for them to use drugs in a shed in a parking lot again?   It's an article about drug use. Understand context.  This is temporary housing though, they are still considered homeless. Much like people living in shelters are still homeless. The point is we need to help people who want to get back onto their feet and contribute to our city. Not people who want to come to Seattle to do drugs and use our tax dollars. Helping the homeless house themselves solves the problem. It's an important distinction. It makes it worse since more homeless get drawn here.  The homeless who dont show the inclination are already using the aid and services offered, they already live in shelters, their cars, on friends floors or couches.  They already have jobs and are trying to bust out of homelessness.  These ones are just the variant we see on the streets.  These are the chronic homeless who have chosen drugs and the streets over a normal life.  [deleted] case in point  very clever Look up the state of the previous tiny house village that is closing.  This isn’t an untried idea, and has an apples to apples comparison with a disaster case. Fair enough, didn't know that [removed] Multimillion dollar budget for antidotes for cannabis ODs.  You recall incorrectly. We don't have to work, looks like we can get a free tiny house and do drugs in it all day.  If you rent then I would say no due to a lease.  If you own and are paying the mortgage then shoot up.  If you are homeless staying in a tiny home you have no ownership over, stop doing drugs  Not my job to tell people how to live their lives. They're allowing drugs because completely disallowing it makes it extremely difficult for people who abuse drugs to stay in any kind of transitional or state run housing, inevitably kicking them out before they can stabilize enough and be mentally well enough to no longer need a substance to fill a void. That inevitability only adds to the whole "homeless druggy problem" we've got going on in this city. hovel Our own favelas Most people tend to 'spill out into the neighborhood.' You'll notice a lot of 'spillage' in the mornings around 8 - 9 am. Gotta go get the medicine.  Not you? Isn't this supported by sponsors who donate the materials to build and maintain the houses? I understand the context fine. I am just pointing out the fact that 'living in a shed' can be the result of a large number of factors that have nothing to do with drug and alcohol use. 38% of the perpetually homeless population deal with alcohol abuse, and 26% abuse drugs other than alcohol according to  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (that's a government agency that falls under the US Department of Social and Health Services.) That is definitely a serious issue that needs to be combated. We combat that through stable housing and access to treatment. 

&#x200B;

The primary reasons why a person experiences homelessness are not just about substance abuse or mental illness (affects 26%). Individuals who are escaping domestic, physical and/or sexual abuse, family issues also compose a rather large segment of the population. Without empathy and assistance it is incredibly likely that they too will turn to self-medication.  


I only commented to you because your statement lacked empathy for people facing an extraordinary array of difficulties. It is very easy to become jaded to what is an epidemic in our fair city when we try to stereotype that people are homeless because there lives are solely disrupted by drugs and alcohol. We dehumanize them as addicts, criminals and just general dredges on society because then we can feel more comfortable about ignoring their pain and suffering.

&#x200B;

We all can afford to be better neighbors. By assisting the homeless we lift them up and allow them to become productive tax-paying members of society - the longer we ignore their plight the more likely they will eventually fall into substance abuse. And the key to helping the homeless get off the streets has been found time and time again to simply get them into stable housing with access to services. It is nearly impossible to get off the streets unless you have that form of stability.  


I personally ended up homeless because after a two-year bout of severe bipolar related depression - I tried to hang myself and had a completely emotional collapse after I failed. I lost everything I owned and my family turned their backs on me because of the refusal to acknowledge my struggles with an emotional disability. I had lost my job due to the depression and was completely socially isolated. Without income and no support network I ended up on the streets. At the time of becoming homeless I hadn't had a drink of alcohol in nearly three years, and hadn't done any drugs but smoke pot perhaps half a dozen times in twenty years.   


My point is this - we all need to learn to be better neighbors. I would have never been back on me feet, as i am right now, if it wasn't for the empathy and assistance of strangers - and those were few and far between compared to the scorn that i faced on a daily basis just trying to survive. We need to stop assuming we know why people are on the streets and start treating them like human beings.  


sorry for the rant.  You realize that like 90% of the homeless are local, right?  People don't become homeless then go "oh yeah, time to up and move across the country!"  

>The point is we need to help people who want to get back onto their feet and contribute to our city. Not people who want to come to Seattle to do drugs and use our tax dollars.

All I can hear is Scrooge yelling "reduce the surplus population!" This is not helping them house themselves though.  If you allow drug addiction to continue then they will never transition from here anyway  When they sit around in these shanty towns shooting up all day we're helping them?  I'd ask for some flavor of evidence, but since all you've ever provided on this subreddit is vitriol and racism, I'll just say it anyway and laugh at your non-answer.

Any evidence of this happening elsewhere? Ok yes question stands.  Better to have them use drugs on the sidewalk or in a tiny home?  Provided they’re going to use drugs either way. Asking the real questions  Here's one:  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/seattletrashed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/seattletrashed) You meant scumbag junkies? How many have you taken in to your home? Do you spend money buying bikes for the people in the city who have had them stolen? I mean, you're such a swell person and all.  We try, we try. There are several closing, that's the point. These arent supposed to be permanent solutions in one location, they are small enough to be relocated easily.

Also what the hell is an apples to apples comparison? Are you saying the events in one tiny home village will eventually  happens to all tiny home villages?? But the "Tiny Houses" featured on TV shows are generally nice, with composting toilets, plumbing, etc.  These are sheds with an extension cord and a bathroom in a trailer out back.  They are really not fit for human habitation -- "better than a tent under a bridge" is not the appropriate standard. Cool, so move to the deep south or something and you'll feel more comfortable with the level of social services. And yet your "who cares?" comment is basically you telling them not to care... But isn't that you telling them how to live their life? Hahahahahaha, that's so funny. Yeah all of those people are totally trying to get off heroin. Totally bro. I mean, totally. Giving them an easy place to shoot up and continue living their mess of a life isn't going to enable them at all. 

Creating disneyland for junkies is whats drawing more of these people here. Great job being part of the problem.  [deleted] The article isn't too clear on that, it sounds like the funding is coming from some organization, but it isn't clear if its via donations or a government grant.  Thank you. We too often don't hear this side. We do oftentimes make assumptions that are unfair and demeaning, and it's because of our collective ignorance. Thank you again and please keep sharing your story. People generally want to help people who are willing to help themselves.  Thank you for posting.  

One of the big problems with the homelessness issue is that everyone gets lumped together.  And it is hard to feel empathy for an able-bodied twenty-something who just wants to shoot smack in his RV and will steal to support his habit.  This kind of shit makes reasonable people apoplectic.  There is plenty of this in Seattle, and there is no use reporting it.

Single moms escaping domestic violence and people with untreated mental illness all get tarred with the same brush as these folks, partly because Seattle is so enabling to this particularly disruptive subset.   This is a lie.  The city only asks for your last stable address. Which means an address where you stayed for more than a week.  They accept shelters, hostels, and hotels as stable residences.  Which means you show up, stay in a shelter for a week, and now you are Seattle homeless resident  >You realize that like 90% of the homeless are local, right? 

The study you're referring to has been debunked so many times at this point that it's flat out disingenuine to use it in an argument. The study asked respondents to provide the zip code of the most recent place that they lived, the wording of the question was not standardized, the persons performing the interviews were often homeless people themselves who were hired to assist with the study, and roughly 25% of respondents listed the zip code for Pioneer square (the location where they most recently received homeless services). Since no one, to my knowledge, has performed a statistically sound survey of King county to determine where the homeless came from, it's tough to say exactly what percentage of homeless people are local. However, it's also highly unlikely the number is anywhere close to 90% of the total population. It's painfully obvious to anyone who is paying attention that homeless people are flocking to the west coast from all over. Cities nationwide buy homeless people 1 way bus tickets to shift the problem elsewhere. A not insignificant portion of these people end up in Seattle. [removed] I completely agree. I was responding to the previous comment which seemed to just be saying "give them a shed and everything will be fine".

Housing themselves means they have the means to continue to house themselves, meaning a productive and self-sufficient life. That should be the ultimate goal of any program, not just giving them a place to shoot up. [removed] Better to undo what Reagan did an force them into mental health centers run by thegovernment.

But no.  I think the laws should be enforced and they should not be "allowed" to use illegal drugs anywhere.  Why is enforcing existing laws so difficult for people?  Neither. Plenty of them are here because of our lax enforcement. Do you think that PD's in other cities are going to put up with someone shooting up in public? Shit fly to Phoenix and check out the response to that.  I don't think you know how proper sourcing works. TIL all bicycles are stolen by homeless people.  Temporary people, not temporary and then we tear the whole thing down....   and yes to your last question  Nope. What people do in the privacy of their home is none of my (or your) business. Perhaps republicans..  who's 'they?' Don't you have some messed up unproven bullshit theroy that Sawant was importing homeless people into the 3rd District to vote for her? Very true. Page 30 of the Count Us In survey. 
http://allhomekc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FINALDRAFT-COUNTUSIN2018REPORT-5.25.18.pdf

11% have lived here for less than a year in this year's survey. The year before that was 19%. Multiplied out with the growth you get a 1/3 increase.  You can't say it's tough to say what percentage are local in one breath, and in the next say highly unlikely it's close to 90%  Even if this is the case, what is your proposal we do with those who came from not-Seattle? How do we get places to stop buying the tickets? Very true. Page 30 of the Count Us In survey. http://allhomekc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FINALDRAFT-COUNTUSIN2018REPORT-5.25.18.pdf
11% have lived here for less than a year in this year's survey. The year before that was 19%. Multiplied out with the growth you get a 1/3 increase in two years caused by homeless moving here.  >It's painfully obvious to anyone who is paying attention that homeless people are flocking to the west coast from all over.

I love how people say that "there's no study but it's obvious".  If it were obvious, you could do a study to prove it.  

I think this demonstrates that people are going to believe what they want, regardless of facts.

P.S.  I wouldn't call 10% "insignificant".  Just "overstated" >The city's own fucking information shows that in the last year's Count Us In study 11% of people had lived here for less than a year. **The year before that was 19%.**

So according to your own account it went from 19% to 11% in one year.  And your suggestion is to... add the two? We could start with your username, genius.  As for this:

>It makes it worse since more homeless get drawn here.

Any evidence?

P.S.  You're predictable. Many of us are of the opinion that current drug policy is fundamentally flawed so we don't really mind when those unjust and counter productive laws aren't put into effect. Homelessness issues aside, criminalization of drugs doesn't help. Huh? No the (non-cheapo) tiny homes are built to move, that's at least how the newer ones are being built. These are not and we're never meant to be permanent villages since conception...

If you think that all these places will end up like you're worst case scenario then there is no convincing you. You should definitely take a different outlook on life. Quick, send an email to the DEA to let them know to stop shutting down meth houses... Seriously? Are you just playing devils advocate here or did you arrive in Seattle yesterday? Yeah these "debunking" sources have never been as robust as the stats to the contrary so you can argue it's somehow unsettled, but saying it's just an outright fact they're from Portland and stuff primarily? Bullshit. Honestly, I think we still have an obligation to provide assistance. With that said, this approach of throwing addicts together in a parking lot shanty town and telling them anything goes, so long as they’re doing it in their sheds isn’t a productive solution. I would much prefer to see Seattle focusing its limited resources on people who actually want out of homelessness. As someone else pointed out in this discussion: homeless people getting high isn’t the primary undesirable behavior associated with these low barrier tiny villages. It’s the petty crime, prostitution, and drug trafficking that go along with the abuse that will have a profound impact on my neighborhood as a result of this village. Meanwhile, as we saw with Licton Springs, I do not anticipate that the Aloha tiny village will have a meaningful positive impact on reducing homelessness.  [removed] [removed] [removed] > Many of us are of the opinion that current drug policy is fundamentally flawed 

Who is this many you speak of?  While i do not condone a "war on drugs"  using illegal drugs on the street, leaving paraphernalia around, in some cases turning violent due to the drug use, selling said illegal drugs are all things that should not be tolerated in public and we have laws against them.  

&#x200B;

You are not allowed to just smoke pot anywhere you want either, and you cannot advertise it.  If you dont agree with them then repeal them

&#x200B; Yes, it does. Criminalization of extremely addictive hard drugs is important. Meth and heroin should never be legal.  I am easily convinced that it can work, show me one instance where it is clean and safe and I will be convinced.   That's happening, little by little. Governnent is shifting policy from drugs as crime to drugs as heath issue. The only people still clinging to the drug war are those who profit from it -- private prisons, etc. How about we stay on topic and you answer the question, hmm? Would this be the study that you just said said it was 11% last year?

Sorry for rounding 89% to 90%. Well first I don't assume that the numbers magically add like you think they do.  80% of homeless stay homeless for less than two years.  Most are homeless for less than a year.

Second, your argument is it went from 19% to 11% and that our policies are causing it to **increase**?  Congratulations, you played yourself. [removed] For the record I wasn't trying to obfuscate the number of people holding that opinion. At this point broad legalization probably isn't holding full on majorities in the US and I wasn't implying any different. I just was speaking for that group so to speak. From the perspective of a legalization advocate I see any and all curbing of prohibition policies to be a win.

&#x200B;

Public use ordinances have some validity, I'll concede, but in my opinion those shouldn't be anything more than a small forfeiture (or a bit of community service in lieu of cash) rather than any criminal possession charges. I don't think it can be fairly enforced in this context given the group of people in question don't have the luxury of privacy. I don't think you can curb public use through adding this law enforcement burden when the actual root cause of public use is that addicts don't have a lot of out of sight places to use. Given that adequate housing is a long ways off or almost unattainable due to political climate my favorite current solution is the (now pretty solidly backed by case study statistics) safe injection facilities. Whatever can be done to put the weight of this stuff back onto the back of our public heath and housing services is a win for cops, users, and the greater community.

&#x200B;

As for public weed smoking. Cops look the other way any time I've seen them spot it happening regardless of the class status of the smoker. I'd rather smell it than cigarettes or pancake vape personally so I don't take issue with that at all. So yeah, it's technically not allowed, but the cops can't be fucked to bother with enforcement since even they know it's not really a serious concern. Some tourist families might be disapproving, but they'll survive. Seattleites themselves don't seem to bat an eye about it largely either.

&#x200B;

You're right though, this is a battle that needs to be fought democratically and I am a very active member of organizations pushing for that. Weird because almost every case study on this (Portugal, Mexico, etc) shows that decriminalization of all drugs has been a very successful way of reducing use and protecting addicts from a viscous cycle of incarceration and destitution that costs money and does nothing good for anyone except private prison contractors. https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2018/0806/In-Denver-it-takes-a-tiny-house-village-to-combat-homelessness


Also no one likes a cynical naysayer. If you don't like a solution to something offer or show support for a better one.
