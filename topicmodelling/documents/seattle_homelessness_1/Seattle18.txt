Stolen bikes being torn down. SODO.  What do thieves do with the stolen bike parts? Is there somewhere that will buy this stuff from them? I've driven by there and noticed the blatant amount of bicycle parts. I can't see any way police are not aware, so I can only hope that they were all legally acquired. Otherwise, allowing this type of behavior to continue is a real slap to the face to all the taxpayers in Seattle. 

Edit - Isn't this also by the "tent" that damn near resembles a micro house? Complete with wood walls and all? That is another shocking sight.  This is near the Taco Bell on 4th in SoDo. Tons of tents, RVs (some with huge tarps over them), etc., but zero police presence (plenty of meter maids, though).  "No crime here --- Seattle Police...." This is not the time to cover a person's face. That image should go to Seattle PD.  I've seen people shoot up besides the Macy's building often enough. If police won't do anything about that, which is in plain sight in the heart of the city, then I doubt they'll do anything about this. Sorry 😕 Why is that face hidden? They are in public view. Where are the lime bikes? I once got into a fight with someone because (according to her) I had no right to assume these were stolen. 🙄 Who's buying all these stolen bikes and parts? Why would anyone buy a used bike part? You have no idea about its history or wear and new parts are not that expensive.  Just a sad situation all around. I have tons of sympathy + empathy for these people.. whether addicts or just a well meaning family trying to get by, everyone has a story that lead them there. 

That said - there needs to be some consequence for doing stuff like that, especially when its being done right in front of everybody. Or the cycle will just continue ...

 I don't have the answers, I just know there has to be a better way of dealing with this shit then moving them a block at a time, then ignoring them until enough complaints force them to move them to another block away...  ignoring this will just encourage more of the same shit. This is normal now.   San Francisco 2.0 Think you could grab me a set of carbon 700c wheels please...? lol these assumptions... maybe he’s a collector? ............................................................... of other people property.  what's more amazing and harder to believe than the complete lack of a law enforcement response is the ability of these homeless people to do complete teardowns of many bikes from many different makes and models, of all different ages and of various conditions without any real tools or anything resembling a bench or bike stand.  Oh, so *that's* the spot where they're doing that! I live a block from there, in the artist's lofts on 1st. One of those assholes in an RV with a mound of stripped bikes actually had an open/closed sign. Seattle's City council sure seems hell-bent on screwing over the city for the sake of the homeless population, because progressive PC. A cut off your nose to spite your face kinda policy. Try rolling down Dawson, there’s an RV with a huge trash can (those ones they use for events) filled with bicycles 🙄 I work graveyards around this area. Its not uncommon to see vagrants stealing stolen bicycles from other vagrants while they sleep.

I'm not calling them homeless. I've been homeless and obeyed the law while working a legitimate job to fix my problems. These criminals masquerading as homeless are criminals trying to get their fix.

Bicycles seem to be a huge commodity here in Seattle because theft of bicycles is pretty common.  Here’s an idea.   Fuck em.  

Make this asshole’s life (and the thousands of other homeless pitching up tents, shitting on the sidewalk, pissing in public, shooting up, dropping needles, threatening people with an axe, and stealing from decent citizens) a living hell.  

They aren’t paying taxes, they aren’t contributing, they are abusing the city and are a scar.

Fuck em.  Bulldoze the tents.  Have them sit naked in the rain.  Buy them one way tickets out of town.  Have the police badger the hell out of them. Publicly shame them.  Just make it clear they don’t belong in Seattle.  No sympathy.  No handouts.   No empathy.  

 They could have been purchased yesterday from Greg's Bikes, rode hard last night and now being changed out and cleaned/repaired ^^^^^😂 [deleted] Fire the city council I think we should move all the homeless and junkies to very wealthy gated communities, and house them on multi-million $ yachts, then we can talk to the wealthy 1% about paying their fair share of taxes. The answer to fixing the low end of the bell curve isn’t to tax the middle, but to compensate the damage from the right side of the financial bell curve until those of us in the middle have some relief. This is your city, Seattle. Take it back. Don’t allow this to happen. If you went up to this place with a truck and just started taking the bike parts what is this guy going to do? Call the cops? I don’t think so. Don’t welcome them. Make it hard for them stay. Nobody cares about your property but you. Time to take a stand right f***g now. Pisses me off to no end but what pisses me off even more is that nobody is doing anything about it.  I work just north of there. At night you will see three people each riding a bike and carrying one or two each.  All up and down 4th near the stadiums is a sad sight. I thought this was going to be about those lime bikes and what not. I keep wondering how those things don't get stolen all the time. There's another guy doing this down in Georgetown. I've looked on Craigslist for stolen bike posts a couple times when I've seen nicer bikes but nothing has popped up... They weren’t condoning it. They were just stating a fact (about why parking sucks). What can the school district do? They’re just poorly located.  What a lot of people fail to understand about our city council's approach to homelessness, is that it helps those that want help, but offers the best safe haven in the country for those that just want to continue being criminals as a way of life. The city also throws copious amounts of barely regulated funds into a bunch of organizations that can't do much impact because the people they are trying to help for the most part choose Seattle because it's a place that can avoid this kind of interactment. Heard this multiple times from folks on the bus stop at Seneca and Summit, along with quotes such as "That dude there sells the best Heroin in town", "You can just scare them into giving you their money", "Cops don't give a shit about us, it's all good". 

No one would care if our City Council also added clauses that allow and FORCE our DA to actually prosecute violent criminals and those that pose a threat to our city. But they have made it blatantly clear that they are unwilling to compromise.

You'll also find that our elected officials are some of the wealthiest, and reside in the furthest removed parts of the city where vandalism and surprise drug use in their backyard isn't a thing.
 /u/Seattle_PD Isn't that one of those crime things? Dear Seattle "Progressives":  


You asked for this shit. You sleepwalk through life. You pay no attention. You vote for the people who tolerate this. And now you are surprised and outraged because your expensive bicycles are stolen. Give me a fuckin' break. You did this. Serves you right.  


Signed.  


Expatriate There was a huge chop shop on Utah street between Stacy and Holgate. Probably 40 or so bikes on top of a bus Someone should schedule a public FB event to go down there and confront them. I bet $20 in stolen bike parts the Seattle PD will then magically decide to investigate. My bike’s in there.  Good thing you blotted out the face to "protect the innocent".

Seems about how this city deals with crime.  Had one of those a few months ago in Santa ana CA under a bridge boy did they have "spare" parts I have an idea.   Can we all here go down to this camp and take a public shit and piss on this guys tent and sleeping bag?

I ate some questionable chicken and corn last night.  I have a burning nasty ready to be shat.   

If someone could garnish my entree with a side of asparagus piss extract that would finish the dish well.
 I noticed a smaller operation on Airport Way S a while ago, the place was cleaned up but last I saw there were still stacks of apparently stolen parts among the filth. 

This is among the most reprehensible manifestations of Seattle's transient tweaker crisis, and it's bizarre this hasn't caused more of an uproar. SPD knows bike stealing is a problem, and they know these transients are using stolen parts - the lack of enforcement is egregious. Why isn't it okay to incarcerate these people? If not for stealing, for the multitude of other crimes they get away with while regular taxpayers afford no such privilege? They are active criminals and rampant addicts. Just sitting by and watching them destroy themselves and their environment is bad policy.  Infuriating.  Why would you block out the face of a criminal?
edit: block was black, bad typo. Why even own a bike in Seattle anymore? Innocent until proven guilty  How do you know they’re stolen? [removed] They post the parts/bikes online or sell them to friends of friends.

Meanwhile our fuckwit city attorney won't prosecute any crimes arising from homelessness because somehow it's not their fault they're stealing from citizens.  Scrap yard for bulk scrap most likely That's my question. Shut down the buyers as well at going after thieves.  Recycled Cycles used to be notorious for buying parts without asking questions. Not sure if that’s still the case.  [deleted] It is my understanding that the Seattle City Council has deemed the tents to be the same as houses. Meaning the police cannot do anything to get rid of them and have to treat them with the same rules as houses. 

My understanding is that treating them the same as houses means police can't enter or search them without a warrant. "legally acquired". LMAO. Yeahhh, after being here for a while I'm pretty sure the homeless are basically sovereign citizens I work right next to there. About a month ago the city closed that whole section off to parking for a few days. Kicked all the homeless out. Back to free parking for everyone! How many times have you called the city to complain? I usually see them at Blazing Bagels or Starbucks on 1st ave S!

The police have vacated Utah of tents recently which did nothing but make most move over to 4th. Also many are back over on Utah. I don't really know the solution but a better presence would at least make most of us working in the area feel safer. There's a guy commonly referred to as 'hatchet man' for example (literally walks around with a hatchet). We've been told to just avoid him but it's confusing to me why we need to in the first place? Why is he allowed to wander around threatening people? Oh no, there's plenty of police presence. Unfortunately, it's just motorcycle cops zooming up and down 4th, nabbing probably mostly law-abiding citizens speeding. Nevermind the junkies wandering into traffic, passed out on sidewalks, etc. Gotta go after the guaranteed revenue. I work for Seattle School district. We’ve been in trainings all week at the main office and were told that whole street by their building, and for three blocks down, is all legal street parking for homeless car campers. The entire street smells of human waste. It’s awful. I did see a lot of police there today, about 4 cops on bikes down the street from the district office.  Seattle police only fuck with people who they know can pay tickets or bail. They're the city's ATM at this point, and it's not fair to anyone, including the SPD officers who see this shit and have, themselves, been handcuffed by their superiors. No one gives a fuck. They are not residing in high tax payer areas so it is irrelevant.  There is a police station less than a mile away on walker. police in seattle don't solve crimes, they are far too busy stopping commuters on their way to work on 15th for going 5 mph over the speed limit. 

keep the city safe and working, you fucking cowardly pussies! Cue someone saying that they're just bikes donated for repair or some tripe It's not the police as much as it is Seattle government.  It boils my blood that the vocal minority who show up to city hall meetings would be screaming "stop criminalizing homelessness!!!" at the top of their lungs if you started arresting these people... and our city council would listen to them. It is not the police claiming this there's no crime if the police never encounter it.  Pfffff Please....like SPD would do anything. These seattle Junkies are invinsible. Live where you want? SURE!!!...Shit on the street? WHY NOT?!... Heroine? Let us get you some needles!!! [removed] you could email the sheriff of this retarded town every criminal's face, collated and including information of their whereabouts, and he or she would never finish eating paste long enough to get out of his or her chair to do anything about it.  To prevent vigilantism? Those bikes require special tools to take apart. I was wondering why people weren't stealing them myself, and so I took a look at one. The bolts have a weird slot for a tool I might describe as an Allen wrench with three flanges. I buy used used bike parts to replace the ones that were stolen off my bike... RIP handlebars. Granted, I bought the parts from Recycled Cycles, not some random guy at a chop shop They dump it at the scrap yard for like $0.50/lb They don’t care if they only get 2 bucks for it. It’s another dose. That’s all they give a shit about. I am the same way but when the Pierce County sheriff sweeps an area and offers them money to keep the area clean, and they turn it down because they make MORE than what was offered stealing and getting free stuff,  then I lose all my sympathy and empathy.

Anyone who wants to get clean, wants to get off the streets, we should absolutely use the resources to get them back on their feet. 

It's a huge mess and a lot of money has been wasted on this "We're just making it up as we go along" and ignoring all the reports from experts they have brought in.  You are very much part of Seattle's dysfunction. Your "compassion" is pure enablement, but you'll never recognize that because it might threaten your sense of superior virtue. No, he just really likes bicycles. So much that he bought too many and lost his house because of his addiction. Bike buying addiction. /s I enjoy that a seattlite believes bike teardowns are complex. Carry on, you brave child you. If only they’d apply a fraction of that resourcefulness to something productive they wouldn’t be homeless! Yep you can't ignore a problem and expect it to go away. Probably can't bulldoze their tents or whatever but developers could be persuaded to invest in SODO to push the vagrant population out.

That and criminalizing/investigating heroin possession and distribution a little better.

As a vigilante though you can do what you want. I don't recommend spitting in the face of a man with nothing to lose.. NYC did it. Took back Manhattan from the scum of society  oh my god they are humans. humans trying to survive. "no empathy"?? are you kidding me? They do kick them out of areas. They tend to stay away for a few days and then come right back.

&#x200B;

Realistically that is not solving anything and the city most likely can't afford to do it regularly enough to maintain it that way. Wow, really? Chain riding, it’s a thing. You'll find that a lot of people with extreme opinions like that grew up without having needs go unfufilled, so it's harder for them to empathize with a poor person not being able to buy groceries but that has a home, because they themselves associate having a home with having food, clothes, and heat. It's easier to empathize with a individual that is living so graphically substandard, in a way that the person assumes is worse than your own situation. I find it easier to just move on than to debate with people that are unwilling to recognize that suffering is subjective, and not all black and white. I've had a individual throw in my face the "fact" that I have a roof over my head to mean that I can't possibly be depressed given I'm not living in a tent and resorting to theft.

What it boils down to is people want to feel good about themselves, so they like to pretend they are more empathetic than anyone around them. Which is a catch 22. They are so self centered, that they try to be empathetic to an extreme, so that they don't come off as self centered, while that act itself makes them more self centered.

I just tell people to go volunteer, so they can see how amazing our services are for those in need, compared to the lack of people wanting to utilize those services. It's surprising how often those standing on a soap box can't be bothered to give their free time to helping those in need when you ask them.  The "1%" pay most of the taxes.  But I agree with you about move them all to the wealthiest communities.  THEN some of these jackasses who virtue signal with matters which only affect the lives of those in the middle class and lower will get a dose of what their compassion at the expense of everyone else actually means in the real world. Go do it then I saw one a few weeks ago with a shitty camo paint job down on 4th and Lucille.  There is definitely a technique for disabling the locking mechanism, as I've seen lots of people riding them all day by my work that I'm pretty sure are not paying for them. They do. Love that one. I'm also a huge fan of the school bus that is always parked on Occidental between starbucks and krispy kreme. They have a couch on the roof now! I also say them installing a portable toilet on Monday. Upgrades!!! I agree. I think gangs of vigilantes should be organized to take back the city.  

This can be done peacefully. Video and photo all these assholes.  Post the video everywhere, give them to local news, print flyers for everywhere downtown.  Publically shame all these thieves, addicts, street shitters, and harassers.


Make it so they feel unwelcome and threatened.  Make them leave.  Give them a bus ticket to Salt Lake City.
 Hehe nice I agree with your sentiment, but tired of feeling unsafe. No easy fix I guess  Omgosh you're right.
We are just assuming the man in sandals standing next to a tent which is next to another tent in what looks like a city meaning it's probably a homeless encampment and homeless man who is taking apart a bike next to the corpses of 5 other partially taken apart bikes in a location that's known for lot's of bike theft, has a stolen bike. How dare we assume such a thing. Our police are mostly good people.

They are, however, hamstrung by our inept City Council who would rather virtue signal than solve problems.

The police are essentially prevented from addressing anything tied to homeless people  unless physical violence is involved. By Council directive. I wish we had some kind of Pratchett-esque thieves guild where you just pay your monthly fine to not get your stuff stolen. I mean seriously, that homeless guy is going to get maybe 10% the value of the bike. Why not just pay him not to steal it and save everyone the hassle? This. This so much. People need to know this. Everyone asking why police don't do anything needs to see this. So I hear a lot about our mayor and all these officials... are those not elected positions? What is keeping them rooted in office? I work in the agriculture industry and it was big news that citizens uprooted the mayor of Tulare California for his wackadoodle ideals.... what is stopping us as residents here from stepping up and ousting them? (Genuinely curious because I’ve never heard a single positive thing about the mayor, DA/CA or the City Council....) They are forced to steal to support their lifestyle. Don't you know everyone has a right to live wherever they want, regardless of whether they can afford it. I’m surprised the gypsies haven’t taken advantage of this  [deleted] Makes sense facially, but how do you distinguish a legitimate used parts seller from a thief? They only do in store credit for purchases now. I guess you could see a lot of $1-5 parts to get credit for something more expensive to flip on the street.  As part of cleaning up camps document all the bikes with their registration numbers and check those against project529 Certainly he's just a misunderstood entrepreneur! There are cities that have task forces for this. The police will put the effort in if the city directs them too.  >the Seattle City Council has deemed the tents to be the same as houses

Better actually.  They're exempt from code enforcement.   >Meaning the police cannot do anything to get rid of them and have to treat them with the same rules as houses.

I get that, but if I were breaking down stolen property right in my yard and someone called the cops, and all that stolen shit was still littering my front yard,  I am pretty sure that they could arrest me.

It kinda seems like they are getting *extra* protection by being homeless in this scenario.  So basically, this is District 9? Next up, going tent to tent, getting the homeless to sign relocation papers? :)  I’m debating just claiming to be homeless next time I get a speeding ticket or parking fine. Couldn’t hurt my chances, right? this is the dumbest reply I have ever heard. Even being creative, I could never come up, with years of practice, something this profoundly poorly thought out.  Zero. I don’t live in Seattle. Just travel a lot for work.  Just had a recent hatchet experience with hatchet man. 10/10 would not reccomend. Especially at 6:30am on a tuesday Guy threatens you with a hatchet... sounds like a good time to use legal self defense.  Tents and a shitty RV are back on Utah. That's terrifying honestly. I'm shocked that things like this don't get more attention. Stop voting in dumbass progressives. They only care about grant money, not working tax payers.  [deleted] "What's that? You want us to do all the dirty jobs you don't want to do, but you won't let us beat up any minorities while we're at it? I guess we'll just have to open up a hula school..." - what the detective from South Park would reply with... And does that make any sense to you? Did nobody object to this idea in the training at all?

That people can literally be shitting in the streets and those in power are giving others training that it is all fine and dandy is insane. Not trying to be mean to you personally, but it has blown my mind how many people put up with this and seem to take the attitude of "oh well, nothing can be done, might as well walk by human excrement all day and hope they stop by their own volition at some point in the future." Bingo.  Move the homeless encampments to wealthiest neighborhoods and the Council will suddenly get a clue. Some tripe.  to be fair on the last one - providing clean needles to people who refuse to get treatment reduces the spread of diseases like AIDS.    > Heroine

i think thats a female hero, heroin is the drug you imbeciles are a full year behind the curve. remember when you worshiped these people?  Sheriff of this town? [So relevant right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThInUu7Rg0g) Now that you mention it, vigilantism sounds like a great solution to a gutless local government that allows its citizens to be abused by vagrants.   Interesting I herd if you try to cut the metal bar that stops the back wheel from moving when you haven't payed, a siren goes off. I'm sure you're right, but I see them dismantling them all the time. Is heroin really that cheap??  Believe it or not they actually have to eat too Good luck finding a place in Seattle with bike mechanic pay. A new playground made entirely out of bike parts. I could get behind that.  This isn’t about vigilantism,  this is about a societal philosophy that sets the underlying tone of the city.  Give people the tools to bootstrap themselves.  However, if you are homeless and abused the publicly supported systems by carrying an axes, shitting on the sidewalk, shooting up —-> get the fuck out.

One chance rule.   Bus them to a state line.  

Exchange them for an immigrant that wants to come here and better themselves, their family, and America.

Stop abusing privileges already.  Grow a spine Seattle,  (we should make that into a t-shirt) And now Manhattan is relatively clean for being a very densely populated area. [deleted] Right?? It’s like nobody here realizes... most of the people in this country are only one or two paychecks away from ending up right on the street with them. 

Instead of looking at the problems that cause homelessness (wage stagnation, overpriced housing, a mental health system that is a complete JOKE, the fact that breaking one bone without insurance will put you hundreds of thousands into debt...) everyone here is half a step away from advocating lining up the homeless and shooting them. 

It makes me absolutely sick. I’m glad I’m leaving this city because the way people treat and talk about the homeless makes me furious.  Yup really.

I lost my job in February.  Here how my family handled it being a single paycheck family.

1. We saved enough over the years to have a fall back cash reserve.  A
2. We lived frugally over the years and our COL is very low.
3. We immediately signed up for the ACA
4. I immediately started my LLC and sole proprietorship.
5.  We turned off all unnecessary living expenses.

We are self reliant, understand the better of society and ourselves, and prideful to take care of ourselves.

Just like the US prison system is broken so is the homeless crisis.  Prison is a rotating door and occasionally putting criminals back on the street at tax payer expense.  Prisons just immediately rehab criminals like they do in Denmark and other enlightened European nations.

By giving homeless handouts, free housing, and liberties I can’t enjoy (camping anyhere, shooting up, shitting on the street) you encourage them to be homeless.

Grow a spine Seattle for fucks sake.

 none of these people will do anything. Including me. Goodnight. I saw the locking part of a Limebike just sitting on the sidewalk the other day. Apparently they can be taken off. RAYCIS!! This is an important point. I’d guess most officers are as frustrated by it as we are— sadly their hands are often tied, and we shouldn’t direct our anger at officers without reason. Well. That's kinda how the mob operates.

So...  When I lived in New Orleans, the guys who stole my bike approached me about three weeks later and offered to sell it back to me. At a reasonable price!  taxes?  Give them money to keep them off the streets  because being homeless is not a crime.  Idiot NIMBYs and well-meaning but completely naive liberals keep voting the council in. Mayor is new but a staunch neoliberal so we can't rely on her for anything progressive other than pearl clutching and hand wringing. No clue how like the attorney has been in.

I love this city but the lack of actual adults holding adults accountable is really fucking tiresome.  Kinda think the election is rigged. Like voter fraud  I'm pretty damn progressive and a Seattleite to boot.

I'm just tired of the excuses issued by our city for inaction regarding the ridiculously high property crime rate in our city which is predominantly committed by homeless individuals.

In fact, I've previously mentioned we should take unused government properties, renovate them, and use them to house the homeless while helping them seek counseling and find employment.

But I also think we need to prosecute people for criminal behavior. It's not mutually exclusive.  Yah, back to some shit hole that supports the rule of law for everyone, racist!  Do you want your progressive ideas to become a living, breathing, example of the tragedy of the commons?

Frankly, I think Seattle's liberals are fucking sick of this. Point your finger and yell REPUBLICANS all you want, but when your progressive candidates lose to more moderate Democrats or a Rudy Giuliani type, remember these comments before blaming Russians. I thought you were a troll account due to your name, but I was wrong And property taxes  You're not wrong. I definitely see what you mean. But the police need reasonable suspicion to stop and contact that guy. How do you prove those are stolen by just walking by?

Not that it matters because it sounds like the city council has ordered police to be hands off.  You’re spot on with the extra protection. In regards to the property, how does the SPD prove that it’s stolen? I don’t disagree that it likely is stolen, but how is it proven? If the actual owner never reported it stolen, or did, but was unable to provide a serial number, how is it proven to be stolen? "When dealing with aliens, try to be polite, but firm." /r/UnethicalLifeProTips Alright so I'm gonna regret asking, but what do you mean? How dare you not shit on the homeless population!? An experience? He tried that shit on me, he'd have his last experience on this earth with concealed-carry man! Hatchet man meet pistol man.  Bear mace is great for self defense, I keep one can on my bike and another on my person. Works on groups of would-be attackers as well. They never left honestly.  I hate to tell you this, but there isn't a politician alive-- progressive, conservative, or anywhere in between-- that gives one creamy shit about working tax payers. It's all about the money they can line their (and their friends') pockets with. It is a public funded service, not a business. Vote for police chiefs and prosecutor's who will take a harder line on the ongoing epidemic. Unless you want to pay 10x more per homeless person, arresting them is a bad plan; it doesn't even work out on paper. I don’t think anyone thinks it’s fine and dandy. Don’t you think that the problem is closer to *nobody has a solution or budget to solve the problem?* Jails and hospitals can’t handle it. We can’t just round them up and relocate them in facilities that aren’t equipped for it.  Sometimes if you rock the boat you get thrown overboard... Actually, I changed my mind. Can I get beef brisket? True, but at the cost of many other things which are arguably worse (see the 100s of thousands of discarded dirty needles on the streets of SF for example: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/amp/Why-San-Francisco-is-stuck-with-a-deluge-of-12952111.php ) The homeless are unfortunately not monolithic. There are good people intermixed with the assholes and the drug addicts. The problem with vigilantism is that the mob can't differentiate between the two groups and innocent people will get hurt. There will be a backlash and the end result will be even more bending over backwards on the part of the city. Well then, get the hell out there and fight crime, Internet Tough Guy! See you out there then? Yeah you're right, it's the bike owners that are the real victims here I think you can just smack the Ofo bikes with a mallet to unlock them. I watched two people walking around in broad daylight smacking Ofo bikes. 

Maybe that’s part of why they left.  I haven’t tried that specifically, but if you jostle one enough while it’s locked the alarm will sound. A single hit of that or meth can be if it’s low quality. Also like some guy pointed out below, they trade in piles of this stuff at a time, mostly to scrappers.  From what others who are/were homeless on here have stated - finding food is not a huge issue in Seattle. This is a good thing, but let's not pretend this guy is scrapping bikes so he can get a bite to eat. Used to work at a foodbank. There is plenty of food to give out for free even if the homeless cant get EBT. 

 So does everyone else, it doesn't excuse the action. If you believe a single one of them is doing this for food you are unequivocally naive. OPs photo is a perfect example of a place that can be supported with bike mechanic pay. Renting a room in a house is not ideal long term, but it's certainly better than a tent. I like the shirt idea. Seattle is too passive in most aspects and vagrants are definitely one of those. 

I'm looking at the problem from the top down meaning if you want to understand why things are the way they are you have to look at the money (or lack). There's no financial incentive to put energy into this population, they exist on the fringes. Their cost to policymakers is minimal. The direct cost to per capita tax payer is minimal. So why do anything about it?

The bleeding heart Seattle types aren't going to pick up pitchforks. If you want to get rid of vagrants, put them in a place where they can cost money (tourism/city image/tax base). 

If you can figure out a way to do this, you could probably win a seat on the mayor's board. This. I think there is an enormous difference between a decent person who is down on their luck and the scumbags who shoot up on the sidewalk and steal bikes and refuse help and in no way try to better themselves. My dad has lived in Seattle for decades and is so tired of all the bullshit with homelessness in the city in the past few years, *having been homeless himself* in the past. He lost his job and got a cancer diagnosis two months later, had to live in the back of his car and brush his teeth in the QFC bathroom. He never once stole from anyone and just generally didn't want to ask for handouts and tried not to be a nuisance to anyone. (He's doing much better now btw). I think having empathy for those genuinely in a tough situation trying to get out of it is completely reasonable and decent, but empathy for criminals/drug addicts destroying a beautiful city you love, filling the streets with dirty needles and shit, does not warrant a purely empathetic approach IMO.  Yeah, find a more progressive place to go than Seattle! Excellent. GTFO and go back to California. the one fuck has been given a while ago apparently. Right? Complain all you want, but it’s more efficient than what we’ve got going now. Forget property crime. Let’s go the way of Netflix and Spotify and get some property subscriptions! In places where the mob is really prevalent this payment not only protects you from the mob itself, but they actually will keep anyone else from fucking with you too. I think a lot of poeple consider it to be money well spent in places where the police are useless for providing actual protection. Shit, maybe we need the mob in Seattle. Stealing people’s shit IS, though. And it is 100% any individual’s fault when they decide to COMMIT A CRIME and steal another person’s property. Housing doesn’t play into it.  Could you please copy and paste from my comment where I said it was? I mean, I’m fairly liberal with some stuff but this is just insanity! Had an interesting conversation with a relative who lives in Chicago and studies homelessness nationally (among other issues; her focus is on child homelessness in particular). Her perspective was interesting: nationally, Seattle is seen as a model of how to address homelessness, even if we here see all kinds of problems with it.

Best comparison I can make is with the CTA in Chicago or MTA in NYC - basically, subways. I spent most of my life in Chicago, until my mid-20s, and never failed to complain about the trains. Late often, slow often, inconsistent and unreliable at times.

And yet: no other city in America has public transit as good as Chicago or NYC. Even today, with the horrors of the MTA on full display, I imagine it's probably true that, at best, only a handful of cities make it as easy to get around as Chicago or NYC.

No Chicagoan or New Yorker will admit that their trains are great, because they're not. At the same time, every city in the country wishes they had trains as effective as those cities. (Maybe Boston doesn't; outside of that...?) NIMBY's aren't the ones at issue here. The WITH property who want the city to be great typically don't vote as liberal.  [deleted] [deleted] Can I petition to have my house re-classified as a homeless encampment?? I could use the tax relief! Reasonable suspicion is not the same thing as proof, that is literally the entire point of that standard. No reasonable person would not be suspicious that a crime was being committed here. If he's threatening you with a hatchet, presumably he's quite close by. How far away would he need to be to give you time to pull your gun? Whew this town would explode if that shit happened, i recommend you not go down that street just to be sure You have to be careful at short range though since it can affect you too. You don't want to blind yourself in the process. I like the idea of pistol man better. Dude is protecting a bicycle chop shop by threatening people passing bye with a hatchet. This is not what we need on our streets.     Speaks the truth - it's just a difference of who the patrons / beneficiaries are. Sad way to think. That very attitude of apathy permeates the city and government. "Well, looks like this is just the way it is now" seems to be the mantra this city lives by. Hundreds of millions squandered on progressive programs that only perpetuate the problems. 

Guess what happens when you give a heroin addict a tiny home? They do heroin!!  I refuse to believe that is true What would you have these elected officials do differently? Different police chiefs and prosecutors aren't going to do anything different. The buck passes uphill in this case. The SPD effectively were handcuffed when the DoJ came in after the woodcarver shooting 10+ years ago. As a result, they took a more hands off approach. They have been directly told from above to not hassle the homeless if they aren't directly threatening someone. That is policy now.

The prosecutors can only do so much. They can recommend jail or treatment. Jail does nothing but cost us all more money and is a very temporary solution to getting someone off the streets and out of our view. Due to the nature of our country's policy on drugs, treatment is a joke and its effectively on the user to police themselves and they can easily lie through it with no accountability.

The buck then goes back up the chain to the city council and their policies on the homeless. We've seen how effective that is. From there, the state government. The state can't spend money specifically on Seattle for homeless. If they did all of the other major cities with the same problem would have a case for more money that isn't there.

In reality, our country's ridiculous war on drugs and how that is intertwined with mental health is the real culprit we need to be looking at.

A local government can only do so much. Throw them in jail or waste money on a ineffective treatment cycle that doesn't do much for the people that have real problems. [deleted] I think we need to fix public services before we go after homeless/addicts with legal consequences. That's merely band-aiding the situation and more police brutality or politicians to enforce incarceration isn't a viable solution.  So be it! Just print more money.  We good fam Then make the city less livable for the homeless taking advantage of you. The ones threatening people, pissing on the street, stealing and shooting up.   Make it so inhospitable and cruel they don’t want to stay there and want to move to where their homies find good camp.  Maybe that’s Portland, Spokane or Boise.

Give them a one way bus ticket to Boise for that matter and make sure they get on the bus.

Genuine homeless that want to be model citizen - by all means help within reason. 

Every Friday I take my garbage to the curb.

 /r/smoking it's not being done instead of things to reduce usage though.  it's being done in concert with.   Reducing the percentage of the population infected with terminal illnesses like HIV and hepatitis is way more important than needing to clean up more hypodermics than usual my guy. The assholes are quite easy to differentiate. We’re literally looking at a picture of one of them.  The bigger part was people not wanting a bike for 8 months out of 12. 

And those willing to put up with it don't want a tiny tire bike that's heavy and feels like it has two flats.  

Only line wire with the electric assist bikes was still in business.  I think spin said directly that scooters were their next strategy.  From my experience working with homeless people I'd say the bigger challenge for them is not the ability to keep a job - though this can be a challenge - but the ability to cohabitate with people.  It's hard to tell what's the drugs, what's natural chemical imbalance, and what's the drugs exacerbating natural imbalances, but a lot of street people are just too twitchy and paranoid to live with people for long.  The ones I see are just as hard-working as anyone else we know, but they have these episodes, maybe at work, maybe at home, that undo all their decent work, get them fired and evicted and build up animosity and mistrust of (and from) the outside world.  It's not really a recoverable situation for most.  Many "should" be in an asylum for safety purposes but I can't really blame anyone who's ever seen one of those for never going back. Seattle isn’t progressive. It might have been 30 years ago but the rest of the coast caught up and we’re lagging behind. 

Half the housing here is owned by a literal Lex Luther and y’all are calling for mob violence against the most vulnerable people in society as if its actually going to change anything. It’s not.

 I grew up here asshole Because your implying that police aren’t arresting homeless people committing crimes because they are homeless. 

Investigating bike theft is not a priority for police and if they are caught committing a crime they get arrested like everyone else.  

What would you have the police do?  Raid homeless camps looking for stolen merchandise -  pretty sure you would need a warrant even though it’s not technically a home.  Yeah and as you can see from another reply to me, the city is split between "done with this shit" and "forcing homeless into rehab so they can recover and reintegrate is as evil as advocating we mass-jail/kill them" with a small but increasing faction of "let's run em all out of town."


It's fucking bananas.  So, did she say what is working elsewhere that we aren't doing? What are we doing well?

I used to have a great deal of empathy for homelessness when I lived in Texas but five years in Seattle has killed that. I just want the city to address the issue with science and planning. If we are spending millions on it, we need more impactful results. I have no objection to us paying more provided we see commensurate results.  Citizens pay taxes.

The homeless are still fellow Americans and human beings but I see no issue in treating the as such by enforcing the law.

Capitalism and our government are large parts of the problem but these people are not being *forced* to steal from others. Ultimately the blame lies with the perpetrators of the crime. Hell, if they were stealing food and water, I'd get that but that's not the case. Most of the homeless on the streets have been contacted multiple times for services and declined shelter because you're required to come in sober and free of drugs.

I'm not going to pity people who turn down help in order to embrace their addiction, for which they commit crimes. Years ago I'd have been entirely against the idea of involuntary commitment to drug rehabilitation programs but this city has shown me that's not a principle worth having.  If someone makes $20 an hour and has a bike that cost them $1500  what does it mean when someone steals their bike? >Strawman

>Midwestern cornfields

Kettle black? Many bikes cost thousands of dollars. Oh but no big deal. It is the owners fault people ignore property laws. I don't know why the downvote storm on you for this one, and I will absolutely take that risk by agreeing. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I wasn't really sure what you were saying in the second part though. Anyhow, somebody who doesn't understand what it's like to be poor will definitely criticize this type of opinion on the reality of peoples behavior, but anyone who's had it hard completely understands.  It already is , they just haven’t shown up yet >this town would explode

You say that like it's a bad thing The key is to look away as well as moving away from where your spraying. If your the one spraying it you don't need to worry so much it blinding you as you do inhaling it. That shit will close your airways if you inhale too much My only problem with firearms is I would be a lot more hesitant to use one then I would mace. I dont wanna kill anybody I just don't want to get mugged and robbed. And ... that is why you are part of the problem.  ***ALL*** politicians are the same.  

"Red or blue, Cuzz or Blood, it just don't matter ..." - Ice-T At some point, as a law abiding, not threatening with an axe citizen, I'll take an imperfect solution over no solution.   This is the most intelligent thing I've seen on the Seattle subreddit in a long time. +10 to you sir. If you subsidize homelessness, expect more homelessness. The state needs to allocate more funds for fighting homelessness in general and the homelessness in Seattle in particular. The city undoubtedly attracts the homeless from the neighboring areas.

This state is home to Amazon and Microsoft, two of the largest richest most successful companies in the world. It is bourgeois bullshit that the money for tackling these problems “just isn’t there” Ok, I give up then.  If people aren't willing to pay for a real solution, I'd rather have a band-aid than nothing.

There's nothing stopping both efforts from being simultaneous. “My guy,” perhaps enabling them by giving them free needles and letting them sleep in tents isn’t the way to go abour it. Hey pal, if you're looking for more "progressive", it only gets shittier, literally. No you didn't. Go back to California where you belong, dirtbag. I agree and I think it’s really unfortunate. Bikes aren’t cheap. And that sinking feeling you get all through your body when you realize your bike is gone is one of the worst feelings in the world. I really wish there would be more identification on bikes and some sort of tegiowitb the police offered. The two reasons  reason bikes get stolen so offten are that 1) they are their own getaway cars. And 2) if the thief can get on the bike and start riding, he knows he’s home free.
All that said, te crime problem isn’t limited to bikes. Compassion for people is one thing, but leniency on crimes that victimize the community shouldn’t ever be acceptable.  >Forcing homeless into rehab so they can recover and reintegrate is as evil as advocating we mass-jail/kill them

It's important to note that also ITT: People advocating we mass jail homeless people What we're doing well is actually taking the problem seriously, spending money on it, moving towards low-barrier shelters and trying to address the high cost of housing. It's not that we're so great, but that's a lot more than than most places are doing.

The thing is, the city *is* addressing it with science and planning. It's just a tough issue to solve, particularly at the city level, particularly-particularly when housing and construction are so expensive here. These are macroeconomic nationwide issues that any single city will only be able to partially offset. [deleted] That's just wealth redistribution with less steps comrade! /s [deleted] [deleted] Sure, but if you look at the bigger picture it costs a lot of tax payer money from us to keep vagrants in jail. Short term solution? Lock up your bike better or bring it inside. This isn't simple.  Actually, the key is to never be downwind of an attacker. Or use actual defense spray which is both more directional and much more concentrated. This is not entirely true, there are a few wide eyed innocents out there who probably still think they can make a difference or change the system. And maybe now we are looking at our best (or last?) chance.

But man those kids are going to get the shit kicked out of them. Politics is a business like any other now, only way sleazier than most. What is your solution? I’m just a dude that has some experience and knows a person that works in the mix of this whole thing.

I wish I had an answer myself. I don’t. This is part of living in a large metropolitan area. There’s people that are down on their luck and need a hand, we should be willing to help them. There’s also people that are so in the throes of mental illness they don’t care anymore. There’s no amount of handouts that will help those people. They need professional help against their will. How do we determine who needs what? It’s really tough from the outside.

Our society should be better equipped to help them, but very few of us law abiding citizens actually care. Myself included. This is a local problem, that is a symptom of a larger national issue. We can’t just fix it with money, and we can’t convince other people to care more. It’s fucked. Or: If you make housing extremely expensive, expect more homelessness. Lots of cheaper houses just north of the occupied seattle  No, it absolutely is. Needle exchanges have proven time and again to be one of the best ways to reduce the spread of bloodborne diseases, end of story. If an addict doesn't have access to clean needles, they WILL reuse their old ones and/or share with somebody else. There's no scenario here where addicts stop using out of fear of catching something. Either they don't know exactly how risky it is or they're at a point avoiding withdrawal is worth taking that chance.

Jury's still out on these safe injection sites. But the benefits of exchanges far outweigh the drawbacks Really? You honestly think Seattle is the most progressive place in the world?

I feel sorry for you. Keep sucking that Bezos dick though, I’m sure it’ll pay off someday.  “Maybe we should consider not killing homeless people”

“Fuck u. Go back to California, dirtbag.”

Yeah. I’ve lived here my whole life and I’ve never lived in California. Never will. 

You on the other hand might just wanna set foot in an anger management workshop or two.  Welcome to Trump's America.  Jail those that refuse help that our citizens are kind enough to pay for. That's the only way to stop this insanity.
 Not much can be done until you start keeping track of how the money is actually spent and require results from the different organizations that get millions each yearv I'm not saying we don't help them.

I am saying that they may need to be helped against their will *because* they are incapable of consenting to help.

I took about a year of psychoneuroimmunology courses in under grad as well as a neurology of addiction course. I'm familiar with the effects of drugs and stress on the brain. Nothing in those courses said you lose all will power and are rendered incapable of ethical actions.

So we need to hold them responsible for crimes committed. Property theft isn't victimless.  Someone making $20/hour is hardly hoarding billions in wealth. I'd be surprised if they were hoarding any wealth at all. They'd probably be lucky to have savings period. So again I'll ask, when someone who makes $20/hr has their $1500 bike stolen, what does it mean to them? I'll help with your answer - is it just a thing they no longer have, or is it more than that? Did Jeff Bezos force the hordes of zombie drug users in Seattle to try heroin and destroy their lives? Sounds like you need to move to Korea or China because you want to live in a socialist society 

At some point someone made the choice to stick a needle into their veins, and they can now deal with the consequences of that choice  Yes it should. They broke the law. Stealing a bike isn't survival. Stealing food is. Stealing a bike is so they can get money to buy drugs. But having a million needles found at these camps also must not be their fault based on your logic.  How much do you think it costs compared to building them an affordable home and covering what rent there is because they are unemployed and still on drugs?  Nothing wrong with carrying pepper spray too I just like the range and radius of bear spray At what level?  Not at the city, county, or state level.  So, I suppose that there is a mathematical chance that there is someone at the federal level who is really trying to make a difference, but I highly doubt it.  If they existed, it should be fairly easy to provide such an example.  But, they don't.  So, you can't.

The ***ONLY*** things politicians care about is re-election. Best of bad solutions is probably hospitalization for those obviously suffering from mental illness, and forced cleanup of homeless camps.   Enforcing the laws that are currently on the books.  There is no reason that tax-paying, law-abiding citizens should suffer those who are neither. Respectfully, I don't agree with your assertion that this is something we should deal with because it's part of a metropolitan area - I moved here from Dallas 2 years ago and did not experience this issue at all.  In fact, in my 38 years, I'd never seen a tent city, or a homeless person sleeping on the sidewalk.  In my 38 years, I've never seen someone shoot up in broad daylight or smoke crack in the alcove of a shop down Main Street, and it's not like Dallas is a small city. 

I don't pretend to know how to solve this problem at all, but saying it's part of living in a metro area just isn't accurate. Yes, thank you. It's kind of incredible how many people who live here seem to want all the good that comes from a city - food, nightlife, culture - but none of the bad. When you get hundreds of thousands of people living in close proximity, you're gonna see a lot of different sides of human existence. If you don't want to see those things, live in the suburbs or the country.

I've never been to an American city that didn't have a problem with homelessness, and this is one of the most expensive cities in America. How hard is it to imagine that those two facts make it kinda tough to "solve" the homelessness problem here? DEFINITELY! Oh, NO, I don't - I know that every "progressive" city in the US is littered with shit and needles on the street. Forcing those who refuse help to leave would be a step in the right direction for me. Look. Come to Seattle we will help you. But don’t come to Seattle to be useless. If you don’t want help then wonder on. 

I lived in a place in CA that if you were homeless the sherif would offer you help. If you didn’t accept he would put your shit in his truck and drive you to the edge of town and say don’t come back. 

But Seattle offers millions in help that goes unused in services that could better the homeless situation. But the services that are used don’t benefit anyone but the drug addicted. And they flock from miles and miles to come to our methadone clinics so they can get help getting high. 

Get help or get out. Or if the city is truly going to do nothing, reallocate that money for something useful. Like lowering property tax or fixing the streets.  We would definitely have to define homelessness then. Not all homeless people need rehab, and not all homeless people are a drain on the system. I know a guy who is a teacher for Seattle Public Schools who sleeps in a van. He has a gym membership to keep clean and fresh and he never bothers anybody. Should he be put in jail?
The city needs to prosecute criminal activity. You wanna sleep in your car? Go right ahead, but if touch someone else’s stuff or sh*t in their yard, we’ll keep your car for you until you’ve served your time.  Well funny you would say that since 12step does say you lose power.  Anyway, drugs get put on the level of survival instincts. You can choose but your choices and values are warped around it. Just like do you really choose to have sex or eat. They are not normal choices. And we don't choose them for survival, we choose them since we are compelled to do so. The phenomenology of addiction is kind of like when you were young and constantly making plans and scheme's to try to get laid or get someone to like you. Telling them to just stop it is kind of like telling depressed people to be happy or judging them for not being happy. You are judging them for a symptom of their disease (or biological condition if you don't like that term).  If you tell people they have to stop using to get shelter, then they have a strong incentive to not. If you can only pay for your habit with petty crime, then they have a powerful incentive to do that. Basically, we are saying we will help you if you cure yourself of your serious issue which is really what you need help with.

The best way to help is to sate their urges in a low risk way for them and one which mitigates the effects on the community. This is essentially the idea behind methadone or Suboxone. Suboxone is a better treatment but doctors are limited to the number of patients they can have.  Basically, offering shelter if they get on maintainance is probably to most effective way to help them actually take the help.

 And regardless of what people think it is not easy for homeless person to get help to get clean.  Getting a rehab bed is very difficult and their are very long wait lists.  Even then forcing someone to detox doesn't help. It actually is counter productive. All that happens is they go use when they can and they have an increased risk of overdose since their tolerance is low. I don't think there is any evidence that it helps. If you know the neurology of addiction then you know the difference between dependence and addiction. Getting someone clean is just helping the dependence, it does not help the addition.  The closest thing we have to a "cure" is something like Suboxone. We should be throwing it off the rooftops. It would save tons of money as a community since it is cheaper than the negative externalities of high risk expensive opioid use. Don’t blame it all on drugs. Or any one thing, for that matter. It is a complex problem.  How much does it cost to bring your bike inside or buy a lock? Desperate times call for desperate measures so I'm not going to completely hate on vagrants in anyway. Every second or third world country in the world is privy to this and that's most of humanity. With bikes in China it's just reality. If you have a $4,000 bike bring it inside or give some money to other people. I don't steal bikes but I completely understand that life isn't easy Paint me a picture of a "forced cleanup"... would that really be helpful? I'd be pretty happy with an anti-public-defecation effort. Tickets and then jail if they don't pay. As collateral benefit, it might force dog owners to clean up as well.

Of course, we'd need to pay for some good public bathrooms as well, including regular cleaning. Yeah, it’s almost like our whole country is suffering from a serious homelessness problem nobody wants to actually address beyond “go into camps and harass them” or something. Funny, that.  Dont deflect, which costs more, incarciration or building a home and paying for their rent food and healthcare?  Ah! Thé lovk it up properly or you deserve to lose it clause! You’d love New Orleans. About three weeks after they stole my bike, they generously offered to sell it back to me. For a good price!
Only thing is that they weren’t on drugs except some weed and they had an apartment. Theft is theft and it runs rampant when people know there are no consequences.  Yes, and it includes a lot of happy trees and white fluffy clouds, but I personally advocate tossing them in jail and have them break large rocks into smaller, more useful rocks. Being homeless isn't illegal, but pretty much everything they do outside of breathing is. Yeah, shipping away of jobs by the globalist regimes from HWB through BHO for the benefit of wall-street financiers certainly destroyed upward mobility and shoved millions into poverty. > I personally advocate tossing them in jail and have them break large rocks into smaller, more useful rocks

It's amazing that people still advocate for mass incarceration despite the complete and utter failure of the war on drugs... Do you know how much it would cost to keep all the homeless in jail? The only things that would do is pull funding from other programs, force people into cycles of incarceration, eventually they would be let out no more educated or mentally healthy than before and increase the amount of homeless people overall. Throwing people in jail is almost never an acceptable solution that leads to anything positive aside from the profits earned by police/cops/guards, private prisons, and the politicians that support them. Ignoring for a moment how your advocating for rounding up the most vulnerable of us is borderline sociopathic, you understand prisons are extremely overcrowded, yes? Like so bad that inmates are currently engaging in a nationwide strike over it. Throwing vagrants with mental deficiencies, addictions, or both into jail for god knows how long (sounds like you'd say indefinitely) isn't just immoral, it's untenable. “Globalist”

Yeah, fuck off back to t_d jackass. 

Your dog whistle is loud and clear. 

Edit: hahaha you actually are one of those trolls. Get a life. You don’t even live here.  So it could remove people pooping in parks and create jobs? Kind of a win/win there. Here’s another option.   Punish these hatchet yielding, street shitting, threatening, and drug addicted criminals to cleaning up the streets, picking up all the needles, removing all the shit on the sidewalk.   Teach them the responsibility of taking care of themselves, their neighborhood, and their city.  
 If we can find the space for more luxury apartments surely we can build another King County jail.  HA HA… "You post on T_D, therefore you lose"!    Can't make this shit up.  When you grow up and think logically, you'll realize facts are facts.  Apparently the shitty government we've had the last 30 years creating all these problems have been hunky dory. What an incredibly inaccurate, overly reductive view of jail. You clearly don't understand the short term or long term consequences of what you recommended; both to the homeless and the city. Mass incarceration is expensive, doesn't work, and doesn't help anyone other than those who profit from it We don't pay for those apartments. Developers do. Housing demand is so high roi on a new complex is ridiculous. And then we get back to the moral bankruptcy that is rounding people up and punishing them for trying to survive. This isn't a criminal issue, it's a public health one. We can't be tossing people with addictions and mental disabilities into the revenge fetish camps that are american prisons. They need to be in rehabilitation and assisted living centers. These are human beings. They deserve just as much dignity as you or I Why does it need to be in King County?  Why does it even need to be in Washington?  

I would just want it to have extensive medical facilities to actually rehabilitate some of these people off of drugs, and to provide much needed mental health counsel as well.  

I would like to feel that my tax dollars were actually helping people. Again- you don’t live in Seattle. You come here because you wanna troll “progressives”. 

Go away. Shoo. We don’t want you here.  Why do you hate profits ;( We can’t force people into rehab, but we can legally lock them up for possession, doing drugs in a public space, possession of stolen property, concealed weapons, illegal camping, etc. 

We should do that I think, and those who want to rehabilitate will be near the resources they need, and I won’t step in person poo. So you want to funnel money out of public programs that were funded by your tax dollars so a handful of private prison owners/guards/cops can make money by exploiting the homeless and people with a complete lack of understanding of the actual issues? Do you not understand how prohibitively expensive it is to house people in jails? Food, clothing, land, shelter, grounds upkeep, electricity, water, guards, dogs, weapons, security systems, computer systems, administration, etc... Washington state spends nearly $50,000 per year per incarcerated person. There is no way in hell the profits from a homeless person doing manual labor in prison will be anywhere close to 50k a year, which means the city will have to cut other programs and funnel tax payer money into jails and prisons. You do realize those profits come from your taxes right? A bit under $40k/yr for each hippie and/or tweaker you want to dispose of. Private rehab centers are expensive and by and large aren't too great at actually treating addiction. They're great for detox, but relapse is extremely common once people get out. Many of them aren't even technically medical facilities. Rehab in this country is a joke.

We need the infrastructure to arrest people who commit crimes while under the influence of drugs and send them to a treatment center. Ones that are publically funded and use techniques that are scientifically proven to work. So that everybody who needs help can get it. Our criminal justice system needs a total rework regarding how we handle addicts and disabled people. And how we as a society treat them. So then it sounds like the right thing to do. They currently don’t have the basic benefits of life in society, so really maybe housing the homeless in jail is the most compassionate thing we can do, while allowing the productive members to go about life unmolested. 

Yep, I agree with you, let’s do it. I’m ok with that. My tax dollars would be used in a manner I agree with.
