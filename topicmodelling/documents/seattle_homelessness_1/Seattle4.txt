Homeless man arrested for attack of woman at Westin hotel  She won't be coming back to Seattle.  "Investigators say he told officers that he attacked the woman to "make her feel alive" and that a Bot on Facebook told him he could do anything he wanted without consequence." Big news She got Zucked Yo I know this guy, he went to my high school and I hung out with him all the time. This shit is surreal. It’s weird because I don’t think of him as homeless because his dad is rich.  How do we know that it wasn't actually The Zucc out to hunt the Most Dangerous Game?  Wow! Thanks for chiming in with some back story. Maybe he is using hard drugs or had a mental episode, or a combination of the two. In my personal opinion, he definitely has mental issues. He was also heavy into doing acid and psychedelics.  I know some people who did the same in HS but they didn't go this route. The story says the guy had just moved here from out of state within the past month, are you in Washington? No I’m in Virginia. He went missing six weeks ago apparently when his parents called him in. It’s just crazy because I’ve hung out at his house a lot and everything. Basically no one who knew him knew where he was. I’ve tried texting him in the past few weeks but I guess I now know where he was.  Sad but he'll probably get out a lot sooner in Washington state than had he done it in Washington DC. I feel bad but I also don’t. He had his life made here... by the end of high school he had like 100,00 dollars saved up and his dad has a very successful business that he was gonna take over. I just don’t get it.
