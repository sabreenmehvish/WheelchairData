This Subreddit is Painfully Polite, and Painfully Uncontroversial I'm not all that upset by this fact.  I just think it's funny.  It's very *Seattle* in its way.  Is it because people are afraid of downvotes or snarky comments?  Is it just some kind of bleed-over from daily life in Seattle?  I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on the matter.

Seattle can't be THAT boring.  I grew up there, and even though I haven't lived there for twenty years the lack of controversial posts is... curious? All the jackasses left and went to SeattleWA.  Then all the even worse jackasses left SeattleWA and went to SeaWa.  

As a result, this sub is a very nice place.   It's not boring at all.  The problem is most folks on this subreddit refuse to converse in an adult manner.    If you share any slightly controversial point of view for any social or political topic you are met with anger and abuse.  Most of us have learned this and don't bother as its not worth the time. It's because all the people who want to argue are in the other subreddit going back and forth with the t_d crowd (many who don't even live in Seattle) about guns and homelessness. The other subreddit is where the arguments happen: [https://i.redd.it/hiqm9v02buq11.png](https://i.redd.it/hiqm9v02buq11.png)

Actually no, native seattlites can’t be harmed by rain. Only people who moved here in the mid 90’s from California. You know who you are... I’ll go check out those jackasses, thanks. I'm sure it also has a lot to do with how invested some members are.  I haven't run into any comments that seemed immature to me yet, but maybe I was just lucky. This. I thought I was going crazy. At first that sub felt like a more chill, casual-conversation type place that went beyond pictures of sunsets and the Pike market sign. Now every topic quickly devolves into politics with a prevailing sentiment somewhere between cynical libertarianism and t_D trolling. 

I’ll take sunsets, thanks.  Yes, arming the homeless is a very important issue for me as well.  How can they find proper employment and a livable wage if they're not armed? >It's because all the people who want to argue are in the other subreddit

No seriously those guys will argue against you about *anything*. The tipping point that made me unsub was how someone start taking the side of a bad parallel Parker ("Um yeah what's so bad about that HMMMM?")

You could agree with them but they'd suddenly hop over to the other side of the argument just so they could continue fighting you. I swear they must wake up angry. Ahhhh.... that's better. I'll go check em out.  Thanks.

Enjoy yet another picture of the downtown Seattle skyline... Huh? This sub has nearly double the subscribers of /r/Seattlewa Speaking as someone born and raised in Seattle, that winter can be a long fight.  The minute I moved to a brighter part of the world I couldn't believe how much more awake I was most of the time. Stay lucky [deleted] Its not nearly as active.  They are silent and non-active.  SeattleWa posts almost always have more discussion. Lol yes that’s not not true. I was joking about natives being immune to the gray days. I live somewhere really sunny now too. It took me about 10 years to get used to it being sunny everyday though. I would always get super excited when it rained. Now I’m good though. Still don’t like the heat, maybe another 10 years... How about bubble guns instead of real guns?  Would this up your intake of mushrooms or detract from it? Or another 20!
