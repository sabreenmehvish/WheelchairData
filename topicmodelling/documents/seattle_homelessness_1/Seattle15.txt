Recommendations for where to help the homeless on Thanksgiving? My Thanksgiving dinner plans have fallen through. Rather than try to find alternate dinner options, I'd like to volunteer to help the homeless. Does anyone have recommendations for organizations looking for volunteers to help out on Thanksgiving? I'm a non-religious type, so I'd love to find a secular group to help, but I'll welcome all suggestions. According to United Way, New Horizons is still looking for volunteers to serve brunch for homeless teens and Ronald McDonald House needs volunteers to serve dinner. [Here](https://volunteer.uwkc.org/need/?q=Thanksgiving&need_impact_area=&zip=&distance=) is a link to the search results.

As someone who works in social services, I feel obligated to also suggest rather than volunteering on the one day a year where everyone and their mother decides to volunteer, consider volunteering in the non-holiday season. Usually that is when agencies could really benefit because they get flooded with volunteers for Thanksgiving/Christmas and then it’s crickets during the rest of the year.  https://www.ugm.org

Everything I've seen about them is on the up and up: [https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10149](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10149)

As far as I know, they have no religious associations.  They focus on job placement and training, but provide food, doctors, dentists, eye exams, clothing.

edit: I am not associated with them and not sure if they need help, but they're at the top of my list when it comes to donations. Recommendation: don't.

There are 364 other days out of the year you can.  I second the motion: set aside time to volunteer on a non-holiday. Many groups get too many volunteers on Christmas and Thanksgiving and too few on other days. I would recommend Compass Housing Alliance (use to be known as Compass Center), their shelters generally love having visitors and are open all day for the residents. Compass is generally irreligious, they don't even have preachers in the shelters and don't mention any religion.

Being atheist, I lived in their women's shelter for a bit, and it was quite pleasant. No one asked, no one cared, it was all about being strong in the face of adversity and building your self. Get to know someone in your area that's homeless. You may not be able to completely save them from their lot but just having someone who knows you're alive and acknowledges your existence helps the homeless. DESC is a secular non-profit as well, they started in 1979 as an alternative to all the religious services that were the only things available at the time, and they pioneered housing first. If you really want to help folks experiencing homelessness, donate your dollars. honestly, that’s more valuable than the time you might put in the one day a year.  advocate to your elected representative for increased funding for services.  [deleted] Thanks, bedlam. That's very helpful, if a little dispiriting.  Thank you, Slick. Downvoted not to be an asshole, but rather because you're not answering OP's question or adding anything to the discussion. I’m definitely not trying to dissuade you from volunteering, just trying to highlight that so many places rely on ongoing volunteers for their programs to run successfully. Volunteering on Thanksgiving = good. Volunteering other times of the year or even on a moderately regular basis = even better.

You’d have to contact them directly though to see if they still need volunteers. Sometimes you can gather from the names whether they are religious or not, but other times you may have to dig a bit. My dad goes almost every year and helps out there. This is what I was going to suggest. I think sometimes the real benefit of volunteering isn't about sorting canned food as much as it is changing perceptions and ideas.
