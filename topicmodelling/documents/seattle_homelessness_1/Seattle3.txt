Sawant brushes off Bezos' $2 billion homeless pledge as attempt to 'whitewash his image'  [deleted] Sawant (from friends of mine that have interacted with her) gets singular ideas in her head, then treats anyone with a different idea (maybe one that has more data to back it up) as if they are ENEMIES.

This notion that there is only one right way to solve a problem, and it had better be HER way? Is dangerous.  The more power the person with the knowledge of the one true path has the more likely they are to stifle conversation about all the options.

Homelessness is NOT my area of expertise, but lowering rent is something I DO know about, and her backing of a rent control scheme has been shown by study after study after study to be a bad bad bad idea.   and she refused to even talk about the fact that the Seattle ADU policy has for years been like putting your head into a noose for people that want to offer a non-detached space (you know the kinds of spaces that would probably be slightly lower rent, and there would be lots of them).  

Needless to say, I am not a fan of hers - and let me be clear, I think the goals align, but her attempts to get there and her refusal to aknowledge that moving the needle even a little on some issues is better than nothing are mostly counter productive, and I HOPE that capitol hill votes her out at the first opportunity. Sawant has got TO GO Sawant is such a worthless shitbag. Bezos gave $2 BILLION and she has the audacity to find a way to try criticize the guy for being generous. 

Fuck her. Complains when he does nothing. 

Complains when he makes a significant contribution. 

Maybe the problem here is at least partially a person who just wants to fucking complain? Sawant needs to never be involved in city government again once her term is up. Not only are her ideas terrible and shortsighted, this is just the latest incident to leave me with the impression that she's also not a good person She doesn’t give two fucks about the homeless that’s why. She just cares about her political power. Anyone who worked with or cared about the homeless would be thankful for the donation. It’s $2 billion, with a capital B. The federal government runs entire agencies with that kind of money.  LOL... anybody surprised.

This part killed me:

***But Sawant said people shouldn’t consider the $2 billion fund a gift.***

***“I don’t think we should look at this as a gift. Nothing comes free from the billionaire class,” she said.***

***Sawant  said Bezos should have backed the head tax, which would have raised an  estimated $47 million per year for homeless services and low-income  housing. The tax seemed to have the support of most of city council  until a stunning 7-2 vote against it; which came after a business-backed  movement to kill it.***

Bitch, he ain't owe you a dime... And apparently she ain't too good with numbers... She's mad that it doesn't help her image. Bezos finally does something charitable with our city and she's going to complain? This is what happens when we elect a protestor as a politician. Sawant is salty that bezos can do a better job of housing the homeless with charity than she can do with the government lmao. I bet he houses more people and more people per dollar than the head tax would have done. Sawant has proven time and time again that she doesn’t care about Seattle-ites; only her political career and what she can use as a talking (read: shouting) point. 

I can only hope this term is the last term we have to put up with her. I just want to know why Sawant has this kind of power over Seattle politics? Was she at any point, any good? Sawant: Bezos! Why don't you spend your billions on helping the working man!
Bezos: Okay, here's 2 billion.
Sawant: Don't try to salvage your reputation! Sawant is such a stupid bitch.

She tried to strong arm him, got butt hurt when she was easily defeated, now she's pissing herself because he is donating $2 BILLION without her ordering him to do it.

She is not able to take credit for this money.  THAT is why she is mad.

 I doubt anyone that ends up getting help due to this donation cares about Sawant's OR Bezo's image... This is Kshama Sawant, like every other politician, trying to attach her name to everything at any cost Fuck her. She wastes the city’s money on defamation suits and is only here to position her career. She doesn’t want to solve the homeless crisis, she wants a soap box This is Bezos saying he can do it better than the city or the sewer-dweller Sawant.  He's right, too Sawant doesn’t really care about the homeless. She just uses them to feed her hatred for rich people.  She is just an ass.  Thanks for your offer, Jeff.   Bezos has done more for the city than sawant ever will  Why can't we just be happy when something positive happens? Families will be helped, kids will get an education that they might not have had access to otherwise. I don't care why he's doing, I just care that he is. Kshama has no ground to stand on here. Money talks, bullshit walks. Show us the money. Please, Capitol Hill, get her the fuck out of the city council ASAP.  

 >***Sawant said Bezos should have backed the head tax, which would have raised an estimated $47 million per year for homeless services and low-income housing.*** 

Right because giving it to unelected bureaucrats will surely have a better result than 40 times the same amount of money from a fund. How do we get rid of Sawant?

I don’t remember voting for this gas bag. I want to domate reddit gold to the homeless. Who here is homeless? So putting percentage of net worth aside, he has spent more of his own money to combat homelessness than Sawant has spent of other peoples' and somehow *he* is the bad guy? And this is coming from someone who is selling their book on Amazon that comes out next year. [Book](https://i.imgur.com/0HZsMog.jpg) She takes him to task for not supporting the Head Tax which would have generated a reported $47 million a year yet she completely dismisses his $2 billion gift to combat the same issue? To me this lends credence to what I've always said about socialism, it isn't about helping people, it's about control, and since this bypasses her and doesn't make the city kiss her ring she is against it.  She's an idiot. Sooo glad she doesn't live in Olympia.  This is Jeff's attempt at saying "I can solve humanitarian problems better than the government can".  

&nbsp;

“I don’t think we should look at this as a gift. Nothing comes free from the billionaire class,”  
Agreed. Did no one see his statement about treating students like a customer? This seems to me like a market test. This is not a "no strings attached" pledge, according to Jeff himself.  

&nbsp;

Sawant said Bezos needs to support higher wages and improved working conditions for his workers as well.  
Agreed. Crazy bitches be crazy. She wants ALL his money, him giving only SOME isn't good enough You've got to be fucking kidding me. Fuck Sawant so hard. Surprised she would use a term like 'whitewash' and not see the irony.  LOL what a fucking tool! But you morons will keep voting for her because she's a female, minority, socialist. Wow, it's so progressive! You’re taking a “what’s legally required, and what did my intro economics textbook tell me” perspective while I’m taking a “what’s morally and ethically appropriate” approach. If I were him I would treat my employees like Costco does. They’re not jobs that require a college education, but they’re good jobs with benefits and decent pay. Costco could easily have the same employer standards as Walmart but they choose not to. I believe that is more ethically responsible than “what’s the least we can get away with paying these people to keep the warehouses from going under.” Especially knowing the vast wealth that Bezos and Amazon has accumulated.  Never punish someone for donating to a good cause, I don't care what they're trying to accomplish as long as it benefits society in the long run. to be honest, i'm not in the loop. can someone tell me what exactly has Bezos done that warrants distrust other than being rich? I mean gates screwed over a lot of people during his career especially in the beginning and I've heard the horror stories directly from people in the industry, so I can get why people don't like him. But I haven't exactly heard much complaints about anything bezos directly did. Lots of complaints about the side effects of amazon's presence, but nothing directly nefarious or underhanded by him. like what exactly is there in his image that he needs to whitewash. 

Also I'm not being sarcastic, I seriously want to know where the hate is coming from.  Does anybody not realize that the $2 billion isn’t designated for Seattle. Everyone here is trying to compare the $40 million tax to the $2 billion donation as if it is apple to apples. But the 2 billion dollars are probably going to be distributed all over the nation and Seattle will be lucky to get a fraction of that. Homelessness and amazon are much bigger than Seattle but everyone in this thread seems to think Jeff Bezo’s is talking directly to us with this recently announced donation. Although there are a lot of things I actually agree with the concepts and theories Sawant brings up it's stuff like this that makes me not get behind her and give her votes.  Anytime this type of stuff comes up it's never enough, no one is ever good enough, and you always have something to be incredibly enraged about.  Why can't this just be a good thing? Even if you're doing a good thing in a calculated effort to make people like you more... you're STILL DOING A GOOD THING. If bezos is willing to re-distribute some wealth to the most needy of our society, then bravo. Judge a man on his actions, and this is an action worthy of praise while taking a step in the right direction. Who knows, if he get's a feel for this he might start moving farther down this better path. >“I don’t think we should look at this as a gift. Nothing comes free from the billionaire class,” she said.

>Sawant said Bezos should have backed the head tax, which would have raised an estimated $47 million per year for homeless services and low-income housing. The tax seemed to have the support of most of city council until a stunning 7-2 vote against it; which came after a business-backed movement to kill it.

Laughable. Typical statists in charge of our city. Jeff asked for ideas and followed up on one. The city continues to take more of our money and do nothing as usual. "Give us money we swear we will fix it this time!!!" What a joke.
 > At last count, more than 12,000 people are living unsheltered in King County. 

$166k per person!

Seems insane, but some addicts in the show *Intervention* could spend twice that in a year on dope. And if they're making $360k illegally per year, imagine how many collateral costs (e.g. police, hospitals, property repair) *that* incurs. Bezos' work is admirable, but big pharma should really be on the hook for far more. How was she ever elected?  Seattle is supposed to be an above average well educated town, and yet the mayor and city council are idiots. Sawant is an idiot. How did we end up with someone like her in a leadership position? Alright erverybody form an orderly line and remember to come up for air, Bezos dick will be there when you get back I don't suppose any of the negative commentators read all the way to the end of the article. This is where Sawant mentions improving wages and working conditions for Bezo's Amazon employees, given that Bezo's has to pay his own people to say nice things about him...........  Far more good than she’s ever done I hope most people brush this off as a useless PR attempt. An amoral dude who impoverishes his employees is getting yet another tax break for his "charity" efforts, efforts which will most likely do nothing beyond stick a band-aid on a structural deficiency that he himself is causing.

If he wanted to do something useful, he could use all that money to pass a progressive income tax that would fully fund Washington State's schools, health services, and affordable housing programs. Until then, he's just a new-age feudal lord sprinkling bread crumbs down to the masses. It's weird to see people gleefully eating them right up off the floor.  Help your fucking employees, please I don’t want the corporations of the world fixing our roads, our failing healthcare, and our homeless problem. We can’t afford to wait the decades it would take for public opinion to make them act. Instead, we need a functioning government that acts on behalf of the people.  Seattle really went the wrong way when they tried to implement the corporate tax for homelessness.  What they should have done is any corporation that has over 100 employees should be subject to a homelessness tax that is based on the the number of employees whose salary falls below the states poverty line, doesn't receive sick pay, vacation days, retirement plans and free health insurance.  The more employees that they have that don't meet these guidelines the higher the tax should be.  For those companies that have 90% or higher compliance would be exempt for that year and given a special tax credit for each year that they stay above 90%.  Sawant is so good. Jesus why is EVERYONE in this thread ready to blow Bezos??  He can write off his donation, if he even actually gives it, and he strong-armed the city to kill the head tax, which would’ve actually cost him less annually.  This dude doesn’t pay taxes, provides horrendous work environments, then hires people to go online and say nice things about him?  People controlling the wealth in this city shouldn’t only reinvest in their community when they feel like it.  Screw all this. Why doesn't he just raise his employee's base wages then?

Not a supporter of Sawant OR Bezos, just wondering why he'd spend 2B on that and not improving the base pay of his work force. That would go a longer way. I feel we need an overhaul of how we treat our homeless epidemic here, and Sawant is NOT it, but I personally think Bezos should start with wages. Please be aware that KOMO is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. IMPEACH  whats the problem with image enhancement if the project works and does a lot of good? i know its too early to say if his pledge will fix anything, but still. If literally Hitler rose from the grave and gave $2 billion to worthy charities,  I would effusively praise him for is generosity before grabbing my shotgun and returning him to the hell he crawled out of. Sounds like Sawant is just butt-hurt that she tried to tax him and it didn’t work, then he gave away a fortune and made her look stupid for trying to take by force. 
I hope people follow his lead and finally end the debate about taxing the rich.  There’s no need if they do good things with it anyway.  Right? Just be happy the dude is doing anything good at all, fuck. He literally doesn't have to do a damn thing, and here he is donating 2 *BILLION* fucking dollars.

You can still criticize him for other shady shit, and this doesn't make him a good person (I don't know enough about him personally to say one way or the other), it just makes him a person doing a good thing. Let it fucking happen.   


Hell, if Trump donated $2 billion to anyone other than a Russian oligarch, rich friend, porn star he fucked, prosecutor investigating him, et al, I'd still be thrilled. I'd still criticize him on all the other shit, but I'd at least add it to the very short list of shit he's done right, which includes appointing Mattis, and.... oh that's it. The question is whether he delivers.  

Trump promises all sorts of things to improve his image - and then doesn't deliver unless the media points out he never donated the money.

Bush promised $15 billion for Africa to fight AIDS and got Bono to be part of the announcement - but then he didn't deliver (the U.S. donated money, but not the $15 billion).

Promises are cheap. Will you expand on the ADU comment? It's an area I'm really interested in but I'm not sure exactly what you mean. She's a left wing Trump, more or less. She's the worst.  I know several people like this, and their attitudes and behavior not only utterly crushed my friendships with them, but also with people around them.  She talks a lot about rent control but she hasn't actually introduced any rent control bills. She has introduced several bills to build public housing. She's sponsored some questionable legislation but on housing she's responsible for more serious solutions than anyone else on the council. TO THE WHITE HOUSE

 Remember when she talked about Boeing Machinists seizing the Boeing plant and turning the assembly line to making busses? She’s either dangerously deluded or very cynically manipulating an audience who she plays for a bunch of chumps. Either way, she’s awful She is trying to drive away business from the city? What's that about attracting flies with honey instead of vinegar. She just seems like an angry person who has to lash out at someone. It's too bad. But seriously “don’t fuck her”. She’s not gonna like your style and want a new tax for giving “head” Has Bezos donated $2 billion or said he will donate $2 billion?  There is a big difference. Dunno, seems like her words were more carefully chosen than your own.  Fuck yourself maybe? ;) If I take $100 from you and later give you a fiver, I can’t really expect you to be especially thankful about the $5, even though it’s better than nothing. The generosity of the latter is still within the context of the former.

Jeff Bezos is responsible for fighting attempts by the government to gain enough revenue to tackle problems on its own, both by lobbying and hiding profits from taxation, through Amazon and personally. 

If Bezos lost $100 billion, he would still be richer than Mark Zuckerberg and see no impact on his life. 

Meanwhile, the wealthiest individuals and businesses paid back into the society they profit from by default instead of only when and how they feel like it, we could invest in schools, housing, healthcare and transportation that would radically alter the lives of millions.  Him giving away two billion is like me giving away 10 bucks.

It doesn’t really matter to me. 2 billion doesn’t mean anything to him. Especially when it’s a 2 billion investment into a billionaire hand washing machine. These foundations are mostly bullshit. They all have them and they are just meant to clean up the legacy of evil a little bit. Beer and complaining, Seattleite hobbies Or maybe you should notice the consistency of what’s being complained about and how giving away money is a distraction. Yeah I totally agree.. she is just an angry one-sided person. She doesn't listen to any other opinions. I saw her minions trying to scream down and silence protesters with a megaphone outside the spheres one day. It was really awesome seeing the construction workers protesting back at her though. She probably doesn't realize that there are also a LOT of democrats who work at Amazon, and live in Seattle (tens of thousands), and she is trying to make enemies with them and the company that pays their bills.  I regret voting for her so much. Probably the worst vote I've ever cast She will probably run for congress... sad but true. She’s great though.

Need more socialists. >“The question of taxing big business and the wealthy cannot be ducked,” Sawant told her colleagues.

It's not about not trusting him or a possibility of "strings attached" to this gift. This is about her not getting her way and not having government control over the money the head-tax would have brought in. It's about going after people that she disagrees with. > worked with or cared about the homeless would be thankful for the donation

Except many of the homeless that are being left out of help since he's only allocating it to homeless families.

Most homeless people still on the streets are single without dependents because homeless agencies prioritize help; parents, pregnant women, the elderly and disabled.

Everyone else goes on the "wait-list" which can have wait times up to 7 years long. It’s not going to be 2 billion. 2 billion divided by 47 million is over 40 right? She's mad that he wants to donate what would have taken 40 years worth of that tax to accumulate? Fuck that. Or is she mad it wont be the city council that decides how it gets spent?

 [deleted] She liked the tax because it was something she did. She criticizes the fund because it's something Bezos did. 

The fact that the tax was for $47 million and the fund is $2,000 million means nothing because it's not about money, it's about her. We have seen tons of money spent on homeless and what to show for it? tons of groups all trying to help the homeless and no groups cooperating and it's a total cluster. And now a head tax, more cash for fixing a dysfunctional process to help the homeless. Correct, he owes about 160 billion. 

Society should not allow the existence of billionaires. Wealth is socially created. He owes all of us a lot more than a dime.

Edit: Climate change is real! There, now you can downvote two facts at once. Enjoy this great deal, courtesy of Amazon! I'll believe it when I see it, lol. How are we supposed to trust him? It's easy to talk about philanthropy but it's pretty duplicitous to say this, while your own warehouse employees are barely scraping by. That alone tells me he doesn't really give two shits about poor and/or lower class people. Bezos and his company is probably the #1 contributor to so many of Seattle's current problems. Come back in a few years please when the homeless problem is eradicated thanks to him and you'll prove me wrong.  Baghwan Sawant.  It's almost like the Rajneesh movement was a blueprint for her idiocracy. ...say all the numbskulls who complain constantly about how the city is "unlivable" these days... Don't vote for her this upcoming election... Shes in the Capitol hill District so she basically has a free ticket currently. So you support the subversion of democracy by the ultra rich?

Because that’s what youre calling for. The destruction of our way of life in favour of even more extreme classism.

And it’s not 2 billion. Quit saying that. Factor in at least the tax breaks. Yep - not only will his "charity" somehow make him more money, it would be terrible if he was able to privatize any more of the education system.  We will count it against his back taxes, but the rich need to start paying their workers or face higher taxes. Their choice. Good.

This is why she’s awesome. Amazon is notorious for working it's people until they are burnt out, having terrible work conditions and paying poor wages which means their employees also need to be on government assistance (obviously not all employees but a significant amount). While this sort of setup is true for many large corporations, Amazon gets the most attention since Bezos is the richest man in the world, half of all online purchases go through Amazon and Bezos owns many companies with dubious antitrust implications like the Washington Post. There aren't any real answers beyond "Amazon warehouse conditions are bad" Bezos =  white, rich, competent, and ambiguously homosexual.  Perfect target for everyone. The 2 billion is also not being given to the homeless, it’s being given to a foundation.  I appreciate that he decided to give in the first place. It's still a whole two billion dollars going towards*something*.
I prefer this over letting Sawant get her ways. Because it’s such a self serving bullshit move.

It’s nice, but it doesn’t change a god damn thing he’s done. That’s the problem. He gives away a little bit of money and he’s a hero. Meanwhile he’s still buying up newspapers, subverting democracy, mistreating workers, and generally leeching as much value from society as he possibly can. 

He is pure unchecked greed and ambition. Praising him for this distracts from everything else. $166k per person isn't really accurate; the money isn't all going to Seattle. From my understanding, it's being distributed nationally.  "He's not putting enough money in places I care about." >If ~~he~~ *we* wanted to do something useful, ~~he~~ we could use ~~all that money~~ *our votes* to pass a progressive income tax that would fully fund Washington State's schools, health services, and affordable housing programs.

Fixed that for you.

(edits because I tried to quote on the mobile ui and failed tragically)

 These people praise a billionaire who passes out a minuscule portion of his wealth while he actively subverts the democratic process in twenty other ways. It's grotesque how easily people fall for philanthropy as moral advertisement.  It is just a PR action.

If he really wanted to help, he wouldn't restrict the funds to only helping homeless families, but all homeless.

Most homeless programs already have plenty of funding available for homeless families. That's why the largest demographic of homeless are single adults. There is little help for them. Came here for this

&#x200B; Its free money. I don’t care that it comes from some soulless billionaire reptile. I don’t have to worship him afterwards, or lick his boot heels. 

But this city cant do anything useful with the money anyways. So we would waste it. 

I would love a new tax system also, but we got to vote for people who like it. Bezos cant do shit. But the government fixes the roads. We pay taxes for that. I don't think I'd trust you to act behalf of anybody. You should compare what the city/county/state government has done for the homeless compared to what Amazon has. You're right fuck the homeless he should take it back.l they get nothing. And WaPo is owned by Bezos who is working with the CIA. 

Support indy and alternative media instead. It makes people realize that empty promises and pointless rhetoric don't actually fix anything. Once they realize that then people like Sawant are shown to be the parasites that they really are. She has taken more out of this community than she will ever put into it. If Jesus rose from the grave I'd shoot him too, that's how you get zombies... do you want zombies?  If hitler rose from the grave, you’d still be on Reddit typing away nonsense about your feelings and going back to watching Netflix.  Invoking Godwin on this? Come on... Bezos is in no way like Hitler. If literal Hitler came up with $2 Billion in dough, the money would immediately be tied up the courts by the families from whom it was stolen.  Don't praise his shotgunned corpse until the money hits the streets Except I suspect you will never bother to go back to criticism of Bezos. cool and annoying of you! wow cool guy! I used to consider myself a liberal until people like you came along... literally the left-wing equivalent of Trump supporters. > I hope people follow his lead and finally end the debate about taxing the rich. There’s no need if they do good things with it anyway.

This is not a good way to run a society. Philanthropy is great, but it will not take care of things we need taxes for. And you can't build a budget for those programs based on the whims of the rich.
 Yeah. Bezos is offering to cough up a shitload of money, like, years worth of what Sawant’s tax would have gathered, and Sawant’s ego doesn’t want to accept it? That seems.....well, frankly. It seems like she doesn’t give a damn about actually trying to fix the homeless problem. It looks a lot like she feels like her ego got stepped on and she can’t deal with it. Or maybe the converse is also true? There's no need for philanthropy if we actually solve our own societal problems as a group.

To me, it's crazy we'd rather trust a single billionaire to make the right decision with their money to solve this problem than people we democratically elected to office. Like, damn, there really is absolutely 0 trust in our government institutions; there's something really weird about that. Sure.

You can build a detached dwelling, adn it becomes as if the property is a duplex.  However, with an ADU inside the home, IF you sign the agreement with the city to do it legally, it states that if you move out of the house, you must remove the non compliant use.  In other words, youspend 60grand or so building a second unit in teh basement or attic or garage, or whatever, adn then you lose your job, and have to move out of state for a new one?  Yup all that money down the drain.  you are elderly, and put in the unit to make money for your golden years, and you die, and yup your kids have to take that unit out to sell the house, and lose all that money.  and if you don't take theunit out?  there is some fine that (from memory) I think is like $500 per day (at least at one point in time it was that, it may not be that anymore.)  but $500 per day? thats a noose!

Seattle has, for decades been very classist.  People say: I own my home, oh my god, I'm terrified of living next to renters, they are soo low class.   And they are very very vocal about not changing hte single family zoning.

Now both Carey moon, and Jenny durkin talked (almost a campaign promise) to allow real - long term legal duplexes as part of seattles zoning, so that, god forbid, you can use your own property for what you want, and durkin has not made a peep on this since her election.  I suspect it's because very wealthy donors have whispered in her ear that they are terrified of living next to "tenants".

I submit that allowing any single family home to become a duplex would result in a large number of units coming into existance, it would better use teh housing stock, it would make the cost of houses more affordable (as the income stream would pay for the owner to be able to live there) meaning lower income people could afford houses in what was the hottest real estate market in the country...  It would allow empty nesters and senior citizens to make maximal use of their own property and gain income at the same time, and competetion would maybe not lower the entire markets prices since so many folks are moving here, but I submit that attic and basement units would rent for below "2 bedrooms in a new apartment building" rates meaning the average rent might actually get a bit lower.

It's win win for everyone, adn the city won't even talk about it.

And I suspect that Durkan maybe only said it as a campaign promise as Carey Moon said it and MEANT it, so she had to come out in favor of lower rents, but I have seen absolutely ZERO movement from her on this since the election. 

It's also the case that this is a "policy" change.  Allowing people/property owners to do what works for them - it actually increased their liberty and freedom, and it costs teh city NOTHING, and will give benefit to the city.

how can they ignore such a powerful option in favor of a predatory ADU law and trying to "manage" low income housing when this could be a tool in the toolbox?

ok, thats my expansion on the topic. I wouldnt go that far, as Trump is a serial liar, traitor, and sexual abuser.
Right-wingers hate her, but not for the same reasons we hate Trump. Don't insult trump like that.  Really?  Please elaborate how this attitude has crushed friendships? I'm curious how your thought process works.  My bad. I thought you were referring to the OP's attitude.  MHA is rent control.  Well she is a narcissistic extremist who inspires the least intelligent voters with bizarre unworkable plans... She'd fit right in! [deleted] She is a Marxist/Communist. That's what they do. Push populist ideology until they can murder their way to the top. Can someone fill me in on this? How can someone vote for her after saying such moronic things? She's advocating people take property not theirs ostensibly with force that would inevitably lead to bloodshed.

Are there any Sawant voters on here who can say defend why they voted for her? Genuinely curious as I'm not from Seattle. I'm just trying to understand the mindset. In a word, yes.  She is trying to drive business away from the city.  When I called with a negative opinion on the head tax, her staffer was rude and argued with me.  (See above comment about how anyone who disagrees is considered "the enemy" by her camp.)  Her staffer admitted they wanted to drive business away so that property values would go down, government could buy all of the housing, and set lower rents.  THAT is her plan.   You attract more flies with dog shit than with honey. People will vote for socialists in perpetuity if prosperity leaves the city and everyone becomes more dependent on the government.

It's self-preservation. 💋❤️💋 [deleted] Absolutely right.  Saved me the trouble of trying to write this succinctly, thanks.  If you want to live in the nation of Bezostan, awesome.  Applaud this to high heaven.  The USA works because our *civil servants* are devoted to working towards the principles our founders claimed to espouse, not because Rockefeller's name was on one of the public schools we were educated by.  The rest is crony capitalist hogwash.  Cast off the lies of the punditry you are convinced save you time  - and read actual source material.  If you feel like all civil servants are just pigs at the barrel, get your hands dirty and become one yourself, and see how it really is.  *NObody* becomes great on their own, and nobody in a thinktank has all the answers to these problems.  It takes a nation. 2 billion is over 1.5% of his net worth, and a lot of that isn’t as liquid as people think. If that would be like you giving 10 bucks, that means your net worth is under 667 dollars, in which case I advise you to maybe not spend so much of your worldly assets on internet. 

But seriously, anyone who can shit on someone giving away billions of dollars, no matter their motivations, is too spiteful to want those causes to be funded, because these big ticket “vanity” donations are how a lot of charities do their good work.  Then be the bigger man. Go find a good foundation and donate $10. Don't talk crap about others trying to help in their own ways. What would you rather have him do? Volunteer at a homeless shelter?  Beer and whine.

I'll see my way out... I mean, I see the complaining here, but where's the beer? :)  >She probably doesn't realize that there are also a LOT of democrats who work at Amazon

People who work in the tech industry, as far as I can tell, are pretty left-leaning in general.

&#x200B; > she is just an angry one-sided person.

She caters to one-sided angry people. We don't really know who she is in reality. How did you not see this coming? She’s literally a communist Why did you do that in the first place?  You’re right. She’s bitter that her jobs tax was overturned. She will never get over that.  is there a good reason not to prioritize families? I don't know about anyone else, but I care more about children than adults who could, at least theoretically, support themselves. Yes he decided to prioritize homeless families. Because you know, maybe homeless children are people he wanted to help.  They should get off of their asses and work. It's a problem we're depending on philanthropy from the rich instead of taxing the rich.

That said, none of my principles are worth $2,000,000,000  Time value of money puts this at infinity... just saying the 47 million would be interest on Certificate of deposit with bad rates. Do the math.

He couldn't afford that few million a year, and therefore would have to move Amazon out of state.

Duh. Not to mention $2 billion is 43x the amount that they would've gotten per year There is even less guarantee that the fund does. Many of these billionaires funds end up making money. The guarantees on the amount they pay out, the monitoring, etc... are all pretty weak. There's no guarantee this money will reach the homeless either. And while the city's track record isn't wonderful, it's way better than Bezos' philanthropic ventures. You should move to somewhere that doesn't allow billionaires. Society should get rid of the socialist, one socialist pos like you gone is better than losing all the billionaires. Perhaps you can set up your failed utopia when we leave this planet. What is the saying, "the meek will inherit the world, but none of its mineral rights. Socialists can have whats leftover when the capitalists are done with earth. Perhaps you chose the wrong society for your existence? Sure it should. Why should others be held back just because you can't succeed? Yes. Amazon wealth is created by an army of techies whom he pays up the ass.

Amazon doesnt return anything to Seattle vs All the Amazon money flowing in is raising the rent prices. Which is it?

For all of us that are not working in Amazon, he doesn't owe anything extra.  >I'll believe it when I see it, lol. How are we supposed to trust him?

[http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/blog/amazon-marys-place-announcement/](http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/blog/amazon-marys-place-announcement/) If amazon fulfillment workers were paid more, the people they hired would be different people with more elite qualifications. The people who are suffering now would be out of a job and suffering more. The people currently working in those positions are doing so because no other company will offer the same deal. This is a basic fact of economics that your naive perspective overlooks. a) the city wasn't going to solve homelessness either because if we did start effectively housing the homeless other cities would just bus their homeless here. And b) as an organization Amazon is far more effective than pretty much anything the government does so if he applied the same processes I don't see why his foundation can't be successful like the gates foundation. People would have said the same disparaging things about bill gates from the 90s but his charity has done amazing things for the world How does this subvert democracy by someone willfully choosing to donate billions of dollars?

Also, whether the entire of the $2b is going to be spent directly on homelessness how does this negatively affect you or anyone else? The city council has been taking taxpayer money by force for years, wasting it and making the problem worse.  aka common core 2.0 I was unaware he owed back taxes, can you cite proof? the tech industry does have a habit of screwing over their non-tech people and that's pretty much everywhere. i have no sympathy for anyone that is in a tech or managerial position that feels burned out, since they're getting paid pretty well along with benefits. you went into a hyper competitive company what did you expect. but i can see how people can be upset about the treatment of the service workers. Bezos got rich off of amazons terrible working conditions, do you really need another reason? Well yea, no one was advocating for giving money directly to the homeless, were they? But, but wasn’t the goal of the head tax to help the homelessness issue?  It sure sounds like you’re saying that the real goal is to take down Bezos.

Which makes your (and Sawant’s) reaction to the money a whole lot more understandable. It was never about the homeless, it’s about sticking it to Bezos. It’s actually more about this being an entirely self serving move. No, he's a self-serving asshole who attracts bootlickers like a light attracts moths Not the point I was making. He's essentially investing in future profits, and bootlickers are lauding him as a great humanitarian. If he legitimately wanted to help, he'd fund a ballot initiative for a progressive income tax. I said a functioning government, not what we have today. Do you think this country will thrive having to rely on Bezos? Wouldn’t it be better for him to pay his employees a living wage? Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify THIS You got me.  I don't even have a shotgun.  But he wants to use a gun, so he's obviously not liberal /s I'm confused, is it the praising people who give to charity that bugs you or the willingness to shoot hitler.  Because wanting to shoot Hitler isn't really limited to the left.  Pretty much everyone but the worst of the worst is on board with killing Hitler.   I didn't mean to compare Bezos to Hitler.  I was just saying in my philosophy, good acts are praiseworthy independent of the evil someone has done (and evil acts are blameworthy irrespective of the good someone has done.) Something tells me no you didn't.  You mean actual left wingers?

You realize the Dems are a center right party? You got downvoted but I totally agree with you. Bernie Sanders lies just as well as Trump does do you think philanthropic gestures should be discouraged? Because that's what Sawant is effectively doing. I think their point is that you shouldn't need to tax for things that philanthropy is taking care of, at least in this case. Not sure why you got downvoted on this, since this is exactly what's going on. Sawant is about making herself look good, and that's about it. I think Amazon was tagged with 20M a year from the head tax, so it would take 50 years to make the difference... There has to be a balance between government and private interests. If you Seattle's behavior indicates zero trust in our government, with the Marxist policies we have here and the amount of taxes that jack up cost of living, I think you could use a reality check! Completely agreed. 
Why do we trust Bezos? When he doesn’t want/need the goodwill and pulls his money how do we hold him accountable? We can’t. 
The government—however much people seem to hate it—we the people *can* hold accountable.  That was a thorough and interesting read. Thanks so much for taking the time to write that out. "Seattle has, for decades been very classist. People say: I own my home, oh my god, I'm terrified of living next to renters, they are soo low class. And they are very very vocal about not changing hte single family zoning."

That's absolutely fucking wrong. Please don't post on things if you don't have knowledge on the topic. Seattle has traditionally droves of fucking single family houses acting as lower income shared dwellings.  Full-fledged democrat here and I hate her with a burning passion. Politically, he's classified as "authoritarian right-wing." Sawant is authoritarian and left-wing. You don't have to be degenerate scum to be politically similar to him, but authoritarian is generally dangerous and ill-advised. You will never believe reason number 7! She’s just an actual left wing politician in a country that hates the left. Sexual abuser? Awww, someone needs a safe space. Taking some off the cuff comments out of context I'm guessing? MHA is not a blanket rent raising ban. It pays for itself by legitimately increasing the supply of housing. The only flaw is that it doesn't increase supply enough. But that's not the fault of MHA, it's the fault of not allowing increased supply. Democrats dont vote for republicans, so theres that.
And Sawant led the fight for 15, we need more politicians like Sawant, not less. Is this r/seattle? How can such "bigoted and hateful" speech be upvoted on this sub let along being allowed? Baffling. Basically, back in 2013 Sawant told the Boeing Machinist's Union, "We can re-tool the machines to produce mass transit like buses, instead of destructive, you know, war machines,” according to [Kiro 7](https://www.kiro7.com/news/seattle-city-councilmember-elect-shares-radical-id/246045525)

As for why or how anyone can vote for such stupidity, I have no idea.  That is pretty crazy. Sawant is nuts. Sounds like she has her own personal army there. She must be disappointed that democracy is thwarting her plans and slowing her mission. Sad! 1) tank the economy

2) ???

3) BREADLINES! There are many politicians in Seattle who hear about high prices and general affordable life. They are trying to make their liberal base happy by making things more affordable. Rather than clearing obstacles and waiting for the market to increase the supply, they're going to kill demand. Tax big businesses, make it hard for them to build, and make it hard for them to do business. Someday maybe they'll succeed in driving the Amazons and Googles away. Then we'll have low prices and homes people can afford!

I'm convinced many politicians are intentionally making Seattle a worse place for businesses, and it'll just take a little bit of complacency from moderates and economically-educated liberals for Seattle to become Detroit 2.0.  This isn't how you get people to vote for socialist. Its completely the opposite. Yes, his company saw historic success based on the groundbreaking ideas of treating workers like shit and not paying taxes. If the stock went down, he’d still have so much wealth that he’d never have to work a day in his life and all of his descendants would never have to work a day in theirs so long as they staved off a revolution. 

What do you want me to say? Yes, I’m glad the guy is spending some money on homelessness instead of 10000 Year Clocks and mining space. But this is just as much a vanity project as any of the others and not meant to address any fundamental problem that would make his life more difficult, like having money that’s regular and publicly accountable instead of reliant on robber baron largesse. 

It’s not that giving to help with homelessness is bad. It’s that it doesn’t make up for all of the bad stuff, including how he’s accrued and continues to accrue wealth.  

Edit: I mentioned Andrew Carnegie before, but seriously, read up on his homicidal response to unions and the labor movement. 

Building libraries is a good thing to do, but it doesn’t launder blood money.  Money is worth drastically less as you gain more.

How much is a dollar worth to you vs a homeless person with 10 bucks to their name vs someone with billions.

10 bucks doesn’t mean anything to me. If I lose a 10 I shrug and move on.

That’s the comparison. What the money means. He gives away 2 billion and he has 160 left. 

less then 2 billion actually. after tax write offs it’s a lot less. It’s to a bullshit foundation that will end up making him money. 

He can make that 2 billion one solid day for amazons stock.  Yes. If he volunteers every weekend at a homeless shelter I’ll actually praise him.

Even if it’s just because I suspect he values any particular evening of his time more than he values the money. Yeah, especially in Seattle.  Yeah it's destroying the city.  No they aren’t. They are, for the most part liberals at best and libertarians at worst.

I don’t want to stomp on the rights of others is not enough to be considered left leaning when you still support every other shitty neoliberal policy. She seems like a total disservice to the people she is trying to help. Unfortunately, it's moderates and a people who end up voting republican when they see this irrational radicalism. What hurts the dems is some dems demanding "Medicare for all". Sounds great, but scares the hell out of a lot of people who would normally vote democrat, but scared off by people on the fringe shooting off their mouths. At the time I thought that would mean more investment and spending money on the things like public transportation etc that would help everyone but it mostly just meant bitching about amazon and doing nothing. I was younger new to the city and less cynical about radical leftists' ability to do anything I've since moved, but I voted for her when she first made it to the council.  I figured it would help pull the council left and she wouldn't have that much actual power.  I haven't followed Seattle politics super close, but I think that actually happened?  But there have been a handful of times where she's made a very public, gross comment like this that makes me really regret that vote.   This is why:
>THIS CORPORATE FATCAT WHO IM SUPPOSED TO HATE BECAUSE CORPORATIONS = EVIL IS DOING SOMETHING THAT SEEMS REALLY REALLY GOOD AND I HAVE TO SHIT ON IT SOMEHOW.
 Because they already get enough funding, as evidenced by them getting into housing much faster, and the majority of homeless you see on the streets aren't families.

 They already get plenty of help. Which is why you rarely, if ever, see homeless children or families on the street. While I agree with you, all the supporters of the head tax had the thought that this is a responsibility of corporations. We do tax the rich already. The top 1% pay ~40% of all US income taxes.  She's just pissed that the money won't come to the city to be swindled away on stupid shit. Increase the tax 43x, got it. >it's way better than Bezos' philanthropic ventures.

[Citation Needed]  Okay.

Leave and let’s try it.

 That's a false dichotomy, though. He owes us the money we're spending to keep his low wage workers alive via our federal taxes. Him playing one segment of his employees well doesn't make up for paying others poorly. 

Second, I don't think anyone believes that our high rent prices are only due to Amazon. Amazon is one of many factors, and probably a smaller one than speculative investment.  Great! 0.5% of the way there. And cool about donating space. I’m not complaining, a donation is a donation. But let’s not think a million dollars is adequate evidence that bezos’s $2 bil claim is to be trusted. 

Generally I’m just really skeptical of billionaires fixing public problems. It sounds great on paper but how do we keep it from being transactional? Like, I’ll donate money and fix the problem but you gotta be nice to me in the future k? I’m being cynical I know, but these are real issues.  That's such an impossibly tiny amount of money. I'm glad to see it's $1 billion this time around. However, most of the analysis I've seen says that $1 billion is maybe 1/4 of what it would take to actually solve the housing crisis in this city. It's a good step but just a first step, if he uses the money wisely. (And the hard part is that it may be impossible to solve with any amount of money if he doesn't work with the council to make the necessary zoning changes.) Amazon pays above average for warehouse work. It’s not the pay that everyone complains about, it’s the working conditions. This is a pretty purely capitalistic and gross way of seeing it. You’re pretty much saying Amazon is doing the suffering employees a favor by paying them shit because at least they have jobs? 

When Seattle increased its minimum wage we didn’t magically see all minimum wage employees fired and replaced by people with college degrees. And I doubt by paying warehouse employees a buck or two more per hour isn’t going to make everyone and their grandma clamor for these warehouse jobs. 

At the very least he could help cultivate a work environment with less pressure. We’ve all heard horror stories of employees who carry around pee bottles out of fear for taking bathroom breaks, or the recent story of an amazon delivery man finishing his shift with a bloody hand because his manager asked him to finish delivery before seeking medical attention. You may think these things are out of Bezos’s control, but if he can fund homeless shelters he can improve his own work environments. Or they would just pay more.

Tell you what, my only demand is they cease all anti-union activity. If they do that then Bezos is fine.

At that point we can see what the fuck happens with wages and treatment. Wait so if Amazon can do it effectively then by your logic cities would still bus their homeless here. Gotta use the same logic right? Or does Bezos hold the key to preventing that or something? I’m all for philanthropy but I’m just saying I’m skeptical. We just haven’t seen much from the dude so again, I’ll believe it when I see it.  Giving away a large sum of money may be the best thing Bezos did today. Did he do it for all the right reasons - maybe no - but he did it nonetheless. Google is youre friend. Oh yeah? I have friends that work for Amazon that enjoy it. If you don't like Bezos or Amazon, then don't support them. Pretty simple. Actually lots have. Just giving money to the poor can work.  How dare he help the homeless!  I’m glad someone in this thread gets it, instead of buying into Komo’s new sinclair bias and sucking Bezos dick without thinking about the bigger structural picture.  RUN!!! Get to the cave! 

*dramatic music* Random fact,  Jim Caviziel The guy who played Jesus in Mel Gibson movie was a Wa Senate page Well shit, let me tell you something, you oughta think about buying a shotgun. Glens the name. 

Wait it’s Gary. I do. Let’s go kill Nazis! Or whatever.  It's the comparing of Bezos to Hitler that is the problem. Even if Bezos is a shitty boss, the leftists comparing him to Hitler don't help anyone. To make it simple, Hitler killed millions, there is nothing he can do to ever repay those crimes. But Bezos took advantage of tax loopholes and labor laws. He repay the community, and criticizing him for any attempts to do that is counterproductive and only serves to win political points. Are you actually stupid enough to think Bezos is evil as Hitler?   Then something told you wrong lol, and something else tells me you're an idiot.  

I consider myself as a socialist, utilitarian, transcendentalist, pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, pro-legal immigration/refugees (including asylum seekers), anti-interventionism, pro-animal welfare, pro-environment, and anti-disparity... I don't know how I can't consider myself to be a liberal, but it's just that I don't like left wing retards who think capitalists like Musk and Bezos are as evil as Hitler.     Context. Sawant isn’t mad that she donated money she is mad that he lobbies against corporate taxes that would help the homeless. His actions just go to show how power hungry he is. I can’t be Seattle to help the homeless. It just has to be him. The problem is that if we become reliant on philanthropy to take care of critical societal issues such as homelessness, then we are essentially giving political leverage to the philantropists, who could use the implicit threat of cutting off funds to influence political decisions. And lord knows we already have enough influence of the wealthy in politics. So while I am glad that Bezos is making this massive donation, we still need a long term solution based primarily on taxes. Agree. Thanks. I’m confused as to why anyone supports her or O’Brien, but I’m confused about a lot of things these days.  Yeah, but if the money didn’t come from Sawant’s tax, it can’t possibly do anything good.  >if you don't have knowledge on the topic

Well, I've had conversations over the years with people.  What I posted is not a direct quote as I may have missed a word or two since I am going from memory from one specific conversation, but that conversation represents the tone I have gotten from a number of people (not all mind you, but enough to know that there will be serious pushback on "duplexing").   This is my own convenience survey, and I'll admit I have no way to tie my data to the population frame.

I will also say that 
>droves of fucking single family houses

doesn't strike me as valid data. Same I really dislike her as well and I’m a very proud dem.  So who the fuck keeps voting for her?

That's the part I don't understand.   Well noted - but to the person's main point that you were replying to, I'm betting that you don't hate her for the same reasons that most hate Trump. There are many different kinds of so-called "democrats". Usually its people who preface their comments with "but im a liberal/democrat" here have the most anti-progressive stance. Good thing she isn't a democrat. Oooh right winger hates socialist politician. Shocking. Yes 100%. And it should also be said Republicans haven't been voting for Democrats for years.  Seen some folks in my neck of the woods wearing I would rather be a Russian than a Democrats. It's how you keep people voting socialist. Make them dependent and they'll hold on for dear life. It doesn't matter if he had a trillion dollars.  He doesn't have to give any of it away.

Just be thankful he's giving away more money than you and every person you've ever met throughout your entire life will ever earn combined. So when are you going to volunteer at a shelter? It's not like youre too busy running one of the largest companies in the world. He's not donating millions of dollars to charity to earn your praise. He's donating millions of dollars to charity because he can. lol Well okay then.  Who says she is trying to help people? Maybe hardcore conservatives like you shouldn’t bother voting democrat. 

Medicare for all is not radical and is a very popular idea among voters. If less right wing idiots dominated the Democratic Party they might actually bring that in as part of the platform and have a policy that appeals to huge numbers of people.

Oh but the moderate republicans wouldn’t vote for them anymore. 

Cause they are so willing to vote democrat anyway.

Ugh. I wish either party was even just a bit left of center. Communists like her arent for the poor, they just hate the rich. Voting for them is how we get vindictive bullshit like this. :( > spending money on the things like public transportation

So you're saying that you thought that Boeing should be nationalized and retooled to produce mass transport? Spending other people's taxes you mean? You voted for a socialist and you're surprised about how things have gone? You could devote $20B per month to drug addicts, mentally ill, antisocial jackasses, and ridiculously violent criminals and they'd still be homeless. It's a lifestyle choice or a basic inability to improve one's circumstances.

Putting irresponsible adults in a building and giving them unlimited access to food and medicine won't magically make them responsible adults.

Prioritizing certain groups of homeless people is the right thing to do, you can't just try to help everybody without discriminating based on recipient's situation. Treat people like individuals and treat every case as unique. Corporations are people too!

I jest, but I do think we need a planet wide crackdown on legal tax avoidance. If nations do it the corporations just move, but if every nation does it they have to comply or invest heavily in interplanetary commerce. I'm happy with either result.  Yes they lacked basic rationality though. IMO, it's not the responsibility of the corporation who are here as much as it is a responsibility of the people who live here. As a reminder, Seattle is where a lot of Microsoft employees live and they contribute to the house shortage just as much as Amazon employees. So, why not use a fraction of the ever increasing property taxes to pay for homeless? Simple, fair and no new law needed. People should remember that the rich are really the only ones with the ability to say fuck it, drop their American citizenship, and then move to a low tax paradise like the Cayman Islands or Switzerland. You can't push them too far, or one day the ultra rich will no longer be American Citizens and thus pay 0 tax (Even with the best tax planners you're still paying something, and the IRS loves to fuck over people not paying taxes, ESPECIALLY if they're rich.) Thank you. My thoughts exactly. Yeah and Amazon never swindles the taxpayer? Like causing homelessness them blaming Seattle for not solving a problem that Amazon helped created? Or how about their .6 Billion CIA contract? You need to check yourself. We can do better. Publicize all corporate revenue Why can nobody seem to understand this.... he pays the techies well because they are highly skilled and in demand. He pays the warehouse workers what they are worth because it requires near zero skills and they are accepting the jobs under their own free will. There are no obligations for either job, only what the market will bear. I'm just saying there's precedent for him helping the homeless here.  It's $2 billion.  Same thing. Did you ever hire a contractor? Why would you pay more if you have people standing in line to get a job. Whoever does not like it can leave. You should not be required by law to make a charity. It would be good, but goverment has no business in requiring to pay more than a market value.  nobody is forcing those people to work at Amazon. Welcome to earth, where suffering is the norm and descriptions of reality are not "capitalistic and gross" but merely facts. Your hyperbole is absurd and off point.  They will be replaced by robots, that is what will happen. Unions are irrelevant.  Bezos hasn't said he will focus on just Seattle It may not be purely altruistic and I'm sure a big chunk is either for PR reasons or as an eff you to the council, but either way a bunch of money will be spent to combat homelessness and if they don't get results it's his money not yours and you are obligated to support it financially.  You are the one who claims he hasn't paid his taxes and when I ask you for proof you say I must figure it out myself. If you make a claim you should provide proof.  But they didn't compare Bezos to Hitler. They took the argument to the logical extreme, and used Hitler as an example. Maybe a subtle difference, but and incredibly substantial one. He;'s not comparing Benzo's to Hitler.  He's using Hitler as hyperbole to say he doesn't care how evil someone is, he'd praise them if they gave to charity.  Hitler is pretty much the go to man for personification of an evil bastard, so it makes sense to use him in this context. Hitler did SO many thing besides the killings. Look at his politics, what he did to labor unions, etc. Hitler was a corporate shill and thats why our corporations supported him for so long. What do you think hitler was doing in the 30s? Those years are what we are comparing when we compare him to hitler, his policies outside the realm of irrational hatred for jews and socialists. By associating Hitler exclusively with genocide, we completely ignore how all his economic policies destroyed the working class and made the wealthy class richer. We ignore how they relate to fascism. Hitler was obscenely wealthy. He’s paying <1% of what he owes. Are you actually stupid enough to think that's what anyone is saying after it has been explained to you multiple times? The solution is to not have extremist policies that incentivize and enable homelessness. The City Council essentially legalized lawlessness by disabling enforcement of anti-camping laws and not funding the police. We see the results. The ruined lives, crime, and addiction are the blood on their hands.  You're responding directly to my post and yet you have to cut out little quips to which to respond? 

You then start by backing up your first point with conversations with people and yet you expect others to have published peer reviewed journals for their fucking opinions. Hypocrite much?  There is a sizable group of people in Seattle so madly disillusioned with capitalism that they have lent an ear to her rhetoric. 

Beyond that, I wouldn't be surprised if an even larger portion people of in this city (not on reddit, but actually in the city itself) held zero interest in local politics. The young people of Capitol Hill who don’t know enough to know yet.  Seattle City Council elections are next year, hopefully more people take them seriously and vote for someone who is willing to be a team player.  No one does, she is a trouble maker and needs to go. The salad tossers in Capitol Hill.  Well, I'll break down my positions for you and let you decide. I'm pro-gay rights. Pro LBGT. Pro-choice. I believe that global warming is a serious threat. I believe in equal pay for equal jobs regardless of race/religion/sex. I believe that one should know how to use a gun responsibly before they can buy one. I believe in open markets and free trade and am against protectionism/tariffs.  


I have conservative views as well, I think the government is terribly inefficient with the funds they have. I think we should privatize most businesses when reasonable to do so (natural monopolies) and let the free market have mostly free reign except in the case of monopolistic tendencies. I have overwhelmingly voted democrat in the past, but I still don't vote based on the party - just their stances. No, thats just plain ignorant. Socialism ONLY exists because capitalism fails every time if left unrestricted. I mean maybe you've never played monopoly but what happens every time. Literally to earn the praise of people like me. Good point. She sounds like she is probably self-serving, as politicians can often be, and needs a therapist.  Politicians need to watch their words and their delivery. Good ones know how to speak without scaring people off. Common sense. If the problem is healthcare and costs and all that, then the points should be to that rather than to using some words. 

Everyone wants healthcare. Everyone wants cheap healthcare. Everyone wants lower costs on everything. That's what politicians on left need to talk about. That gets everyone listening. 

 [deleted] Relevant Steinbeck quote re: Sawant:

>"Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: ‘After the revolution even we will have more, won’t we, dear?’ Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property.

>"I guess the trouble was that we didn’t have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew—at least they claimed to be Communists—couldn’t have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves." Wouldn’t you rather vote for people who hate the rich than for people who work exclusively for the rich? I mean I don't think massively overhauling their production would be very efficient but I would be in favor of corporate taxes or a progressive capital gains tax that would be reinvested into infrastructure and education. This would be best done nationally however because any state that did something like that without the others their economic growth would be fucked Boeing should just be nationalized. Company just leeches off the government feat anyway. Fuck Boeing . > drug addicts, mentally ill, antisocial jackasses, and ridiculously violent criminals and they'd still be homeless.

Yeah, but they only make up about 30% of the overall homeless population. The other 70% are just regular people trying to get their lives back together after a job loss or extended unemployment.

There are another estimated 250,000 homeless college students and another 1Million public school students in the USA.

They need help too, but don't get it because of the "priority list" and underfunded programs or funds being mis-allocated. > So, why not use a fraction of the ever increasing property taxes to pay for homeless? Simple, fair and no new law needed.

Are you planning to raise the property taxes to cover it?  The existing ones won't give you new free revenue for nothing. Amazon did not "cause homelessness" in Seattle...I think it is YOU that needs to be checked.. You’re ignoring the decades of work by Bezos and those like him to come to essentially own the government and be able to stomp away workers rights. How much would he paying those warehouse workers if they had real strength together? 

It’s also a perverted market because the government subsidizes wages for these companies.

And the value of time, effort, productivity for anyone is worth a living wage no matter the job.  Glad you weren't the guy in charge of labor laws a hundred years ago. We'd probably still be working 80 hour work weeks in factories. Your attitude is beyond pessimistic, and I don't understand why you think we've reached the apex of working conditions. "Nobody is forcing those people to work at Amazon". Congratulations for being a highly employable person but not everybody is that lucky. These people may have no better choice of where to work but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be allowed to go to the bathroom more than twice a day. And feel free to dismiss these accounts as hyperbole, but they're real reports by real people.  Its thoroughly documented. You dont have anything to disregard, its all laid out for everyone to see. Yeah, and by using Hitler in the "logical extreme" that shows that they think the two characters are comparable. Otherwise it would be a different argument. You are making up a difference when there was not one. Apparently some people think that Hitler is a valid example when discussing Bezos. And after praising BeHitlerzos for donating to charity, he would then murder Hitler. Hitler deserves it, does Bezos? I guess many misguided leftists would say yes. Meh, but Hitler is remarkable because of genocide, authoritarianism and wwII.  You can't make a Hitler comparison without that baggage and it would be silly to try.  There are plenty of evil corporate overlords and politicians in history that can be used when making comparisons for labor unions or being a corporate shill or destroying the working class.  Making a Hitler comparison and then saying "i mean he's like Hitler in every way but the worst stuff Hitler did that everyone remembers him for" is disingenuous.   Luckily that's not what the OP was doing anyway. what he personally owes? you have proof of that?  Then you need to work on your reading comprehension, and/or you need to stop reading what you wanna read just because you dislike Bezos so much... even the person that wrote it admitted it sounded like that's what he did lol  How can you legalize lawlessness if the very definition of it is the absence of laws Lent an ear? Swanant led the fight for 15. Shes an actual democrat, but democrats here are so "me-me" pro-corproate pro-rich they cant tell real democrats from fake ones. The young people who understand that we need to drag this country's Overton Window back to the left hard if we are going to get rid of the systemic issues that gave rise to the symptom of President Trump. He is a product of what the status quo has done to people, if he leaves office and nothing else changes then the conditions that gave rise to him WILL give rise to someone worse - someone more dangerous and who will actually be competent enough to truly take advantage of the system and not bumble through it.

NeoLiberal center-right democrats are NOT an efffective political resistance to right wing reactionary fanatics and legitimate fascists. There's a reason why this rightward slide has been so strong and so steady. Hopefully there's at least be a few centrist candidates on the ballot. 
 If she runs she wins. Wow. There's nothing wrong with eating ass! You sound like the general WA state liberal to me, at least outside of certain neighborhoods in Seattle. Fiscally conservative and socially liberal. I think we are the majority here yet somehow this city council doesn't adequately represent us  "I believe in equal pay for equal jobs regardless of race/religion/sex"

That idea that equal pay doesn't exist based on gender is a fucking fairy tale. 

 And socialism hasn't failed every time? lol You are a conservative.

Just accept it and move on. I know it’s a terrible thing but you made your choice. If you really don’t like it then maybe start rethinking your views. Yeah if you can't be an actual success, you might as well try to bring others down to your level. 
 Sounds like my relatively wealthy grandparents-in-law, who used to hand out fliers in support of communism in front of the downtown Bon Marche back in the 30s. Communism is an organizational structure, morons. Would I rather vote for disingenuous power-hungry sociopaths who use fake sympathy for the poor (who they obviously don't care about as evidenced by this story) as a smokescreen to gain political power or the employers of literally everyone with a job? That can't be a real question. This is very American of you: tax someone else and invest the money in the causes I like. What do you mean? The property tax is based on property value.  In my case it has increased about 50% over the last 5 years. So this new revenue created without creating a new tax. > if they had real strength together? 

What does that even mean?  If they want to strike they will strike.  If it is cheaper to acquiesce to their demands than it is to replace them, then that is exactly what will happen.

> It’s also a perverted market because the government subsidizes wages for these companies.

Maybe the government should stop doing that instead of attempting to extort money from Amazon.
 The hyperbole I was referring to was "people with college degrees" as your example of "more elite qualifications". In this context "more elite" could simply mean "smarter and faster" or whatever. You can't simply wish away competition because it results in winners and losers and you think everyone should win.

Also, you are mandated a paid 15 minute break every 4 hours by law, and unpaid 30 minute break every 8 hours. So I'm not sure what 19th century labor laws have to do with this. If amazon isn't following labor laws then the law should be enforced. 

And finally, those laws were passed by the government, not implemented by individual CEOs trying to prove the sincerity of their $2 billion charitable donation. That anyone would hesitate to accept that money and give credit to Jeff bezos for it is embarrassing and counterproductive. Criticizing bezos in response to this is an amazing demonstration of sawant's arrogance, hubris, and inability to recognize practical solutions to immediate problems. 

 I disagree, but we are both just speculating. He objectively never made an explicit comparison, but your argument is that there is an implicit comparison I guess. Here's and easy way to figure this out. u/byllz, were you comparing Bezos to Hitler? Cause he totally said he'd kill Bezos in his comment. >"I didn't mean to compare Bezos to Hitler. I was just saying in my philosophy, good acts are praiseworthy independent of the evil someone has done (and evil acts are blameworthy irrespective of the good someone has done.)"


>"But they didn't compare Bezos to Hitler. They took the argument to the logical extreme, and used Hitler as an example. Maybe a subtle difference, but and incredibly substantial one."


>"He;'s not comparing Benzo's to Hitler. He's using Hitler as hyperbole to say he doesn't care how evil someone is, he'd praise them if they gave to charity. Hitler is pretty much the go to man for personification of an evil bastard, so it makes sense to use him in this context."


No where did anyone compare Benzos to Hitler.  And I am pretty neutral when it comes to Benzos.
 Agreed, it is a tough challenge but the Council has achieved it! They forbade asking campers to move without extensive procedures from that ONE citywide, small Navigation Team, meaning...people can set up shop wherever they want. Through LEAD, they've effectively stopped enforcement of our drug laws. She is not a Democrat. Her declared and official party affiliation is Socialist Alternative. 
She's an ideological purist and her approach to governing has been ineffective.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kshama_Sawant We're in scarce company, friend. [America is more polarized than ever.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/05/takeaways-on-americans-growing-partisan-divide-over-political-values/) DOBA No way. He's the kind of "right wing zealot" who clearly "doesn't even live here."  
/s (in case it wasn't obvious.)  


I feel like when I moved here ten years ago, that was the norm. Coming from the midwest, it was a breath of fresh air. I feel lost around here these days. Seattle is morphing into San Francisco. Lets play a game. You name the countries that have actually run a socialistic government and we'll tell you how many times you're wrong. Don't be shocked it will be a lot. [deleted] [deleted] It turns out that it's not even as simple as getting the revenue for free.  (I didn't realize that Washington had even stupider limits than California's Proposition 13, but we do.)

From MSRC.org (This took me entirely too long to find):

> In addition to the limit on the overall levy rate, there is a 1% limit on the amount an individual taxing district can increase the property tax levy (the total amount of taxes that will be collected) each year.
> 
> In Washington, property tax increases are not based on the increasing value of properties, but rather the amount of the property taxes that were assessed in the prior year. Each year’s levy may be increased by no more than 1%, unless the public votes for a greater increase (commonly called a "levy lid lift") or the jurisdiction uses banked capacity (see below). Consult the Washington State Department of Revenue's Resolution/Ordinance Procedures for Increasing Property Tax Revenue for the proper procedures for increasing the property tax levy.

http://mrsc.org/Home/Explore-Topics/Finance/Revenues/The-Property-Tax-in-Washington-State.aspx (search for "Levy Increase Limit") Stop BEZOS Act https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/9fvbr3/sawant_brushes_off_bezos_2_billion_homeless/e5ztwd5/ Where would people with no homes move to? "but that's not real socialism"

Yeah and we're not experiencing real capitalism either. At least this crony capitalism hasn't resulted in the deaths of hundreds of millions across the world because people lose the ability to feed themselves. Let me guess: you think Sweden is socialist but the USSR was not. And parrot conservative talking points.
 Sweetie, everywhere else even Sawant voters such as yourself pay taxes. Which is a good way to keep spending in the state at a reasonable level. Your assumption here is that there's a revenue problem.  This is confusing, my taxes are definitely going up more than 1% annually. There we go! Somehow missed that one. Thanks.

It was quite obvious to me that you weren't. I, at least, got it immediately. Most are homeless due to lifestyle choices: primarily, addiction. Some to mental illness. They need treatment, and we need to make sure that is funded, then they can stop suffering in squalor. You really are misinformed in life it must suck to be you. Oh look another idiot. Hi while I know Socialism and Communism are similar. You are a missing a few important details in life. They aren't the same. You'll notice a very family the people don't have a fucking say in the government in pretty much all communism run governments. [deleted] Given the fact that the state has recently been in contempt of court for insufficiently funding education, I'd say it's reasonable to say there's a revenue problem. I would state that addiction is primarily an environmental factor such as poverty, and not necessarily a lifestyle choice. Much like robbing a liquor store for money, you have to consider the absolute abysmal life situation that led up to that, and not faulting the end result as the primary choice. 

And I'm not suggesting lawlessness or those in poverty free from crimes. I'm with you on advocating treatment and absolute prevention of these crimes, which can aided with treatment just as you suggested. 

However, I also agree that these programs are currently underfunded and cannot provide treatment for all of those in need. So that goes back to our original question, where can we move people who have no homes if the current system cannot provide treatment or even shelter all of those in need?



Edited to be more on point. > Most are homeless due to lifestyle choices: primarily, addiction.

Addiction is a disease, not a choice. Not an argument Why are you talking about communism? The USSR never claimed to achieve communism; it was a socialist society that aspired to one day be communist. This is elementary Marxist theory, my friend.

Here's a fun game: can you provide a basic definition of socialism that doesn't entirely contradict the basic tenet of *social ownership of the means of production*? Wow! You pay taxes on 30% of your income! That’s... generous of you!

How about 100% of your income, and how about 40% effective tax rate, like they do in Europe. Before you accuse others of not paying their fair share, maybe you should start paying YOUR fair share? No, that just shows that revenue wasn't applied to education. Nothing more.  Treatment should be easier to get, but the bigger problem now is that it is easy to refuse. With no enforcement of our laws and plenty of enabling of addiction, we have taken away the rock bottom that many addicts need to hit before making a change. We need to enforce our laws. It has elements of both and must be viewed as such. Pretending the addict has no choice in their recovery robs them of their power to change. You're just so wrong on so many things its not even an argument with you. There is no point. But if you really want to compare death counts capitalism is destroying socialism by leaps and miles. I don't know if you just shun the wealth of information the world has and choose to go down that dark tunnel of ignorance but the reality is the USSR was 100% a communist state.  [removed] I would state that we've always had the same allowance of refusal, since you can't necessarily force an adult into a facility without a just cause. And not having a home, is not a severe cause to force someone into a facility without them willing it. 

[Here is a great report from 2017 by Count Us In that cites a lack of access as the primary barrier. PDF.](http://allhomekc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FINALDRAFT-COUNTUSIN2018REPORT-5.25.18.pdf)

>In trying to access community services, the majority of survey respondents (69%) reported 
encountering issues when seeking help. Not qualifying for the services that they wanted 
(23%), lack of transportation (23%), and not knowing where to go for help (23%) were the 
most frequently cited barriers. Other reasons included not having their identification or 
personal documents (22%) and never hearing back after applying for services (18%). Thirty-
one percent (31%) of survey respondents indicated experiencing no issues in accessing 
services.

And as for enforcement, there was an article posted just recently about why local law enforcement aren't issuing arrests and citations. They talked about previous attempts to enforce civility laws with a tougher hand and cleanup downtown:

> Homeless people don’t tend to have the money to pay for tickets, and often don’t come to court, which means an infraction turns into a criminal charge. They then can be arrested, and jailed for a few days...


>“So you’d fix the problem for the hour or the day, but they’d be back, and you felt like you were spinning your wheels,” said Jim Pugel, who spent 31 years at Seattle police, including a stint as interim police chief. “There are smarter ways to do it...


They even mention your refusal issue:

> In the statement, Holmes reiterated that Seattle “can’t arrest ourselves out of this problem.” But he pointed out that if someone declines an offer of shelter, officers can issue a trespass warning, which, if violated, he can prosecute. As of June, his office has charged four of those cases this year.

[Here is the full article.](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/why-are-the-police-not-enforcing-the-laws-against-camping-in-seattles-parks-and-streets/) It's a great read in of itself as it talks about the Navigation team and what they're doing. Like medical conditions which usher in poverty, recovery from addiction is often out of reach of those afflicted without outside support.
 
The opioid crisis alone is a shining example of why we need universal healthcare. The boon to the economy at large as millions are lifted out of addiction and into working health would be like nothing this nation has experienced since the end of WW2.  Still not an argument. That's just emotional conjecture.

Initiation of force through taxes or seizure of means of production is unethical and immoral as it breaks the unalienable right to liberty granted to us by the Constitution. Have you ever even read anything by Marx, or even the damn [Wikipedia article on economic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system#Socialism)? You seem confused. This is like arguing theology with a devout "Christian" who has never read the Bible and refuses to believe Jesus was Jewish.

I'll ask again: what's your definition of socialism and how does it relate to social ownership of the means of production?  I am not the Sawant voter here, sweetheart. That is a well-considered reply! Thank you!

We have not always had the same basis of refusal. A turning point was when the SCC made it impossible to move campers without multiple engagements from the Navigation Team, essentially legalizing street camping. Lax enforcement of laws in the name of compassion has also proved to have cruel outcomes. 

Surveys of this (and any) population should not be accepted as fact without considered the quality of the data. These folks are often psychotic or in the throes of addiction, not to mention having an incentive to lie about their hometown or other aspects of their situation in attempts to survive or maintain basic comforts or avoid jail. 

In short, Holmes is wrong. Entirely wrong. Not enforcing the law is what has caused this swelled the epidemic of addiction on the streets of Seattle. We stopped enforcing the law, started enabling and incentivizing homelessness and suffering, and the streets have swelled with a publicly suffering, addicted population.  I like your optimistic scenario but you realize there are plenty of rehab options that are covered by the free healthcare currently available to Americans, Medicade?  You keep missing the point. No ones arguing with you. You're too dumb to talk to. At no point could I ever convince you of anything. Your just an ignorant person who doesn't want to learn anything. You think socialism has killed 100s of million of people through starvation. 

  Initiation of force through taxes or seizure of means of production is unethical and immoral as it breaks the unalienable right to liberty granted to us by the Constitution.

Shit like this is just you talking out your ass to the fullest extent of the law. You aren't even smart enough to understand the BASIC lesson of monopoly.  No they aren't the same. Here maybe this will help educate [you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) on socialism and [Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)
A giant key difference you might notice is that socialistic society's are democracies and communistic society's aren't. Once again I'll relay the game of monopoly to you we are playing and losing to the world. You'll notice some of our most famous american companies are owned by foreign powers. We can do so much better and we owe it to one another to do that. Still not an argument. So yeah I guess you are right about something.  Societies* Really? You think that government alone is the solution to the opioid crisis? There's nothing between us and "millions" being "lifted out of addiction" - just most spending, and then people won't be addicts? Let's not let the fact that there are lots of free rehab options available get in the way of this .../s....

You need to come back to reality. That's not how people work. People have to be motivated, and laws preventing them from being public menaces to society, taking over the streets of a city is part of that.

I am for as much free healthcare as we can afford, and we've taken big steps in that direction. But the solution to this crisis is restoring a "rock bottom" minimum level of decency. The blame is on the seattle city council for this man made disaster. Yes I'm right you're a moron. Thank you for settling that. Though again still not an argument. How is it that you don't realize that what works literally everywhere else will work here, while also not realizing that what we have literally is the worst possible option for both cost effectiveness and patient wellbeing? Separate questions - 1) is universal healthcare the thing for the US right now and 2) will that solve the opioid crisis and Seattle's homelessness crisis

I was mainly addressing 2)
