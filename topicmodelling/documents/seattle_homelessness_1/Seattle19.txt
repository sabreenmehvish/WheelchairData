Where can I donate socks? I read somewhere that socks are the most needed but least donated item. Made a few drunken mistakes last week and need to do something to get over it.  You got drunk and bought a lot of socks you don’t need? You got drunk and bought socks. You live in Seattle. If I were you I'd want my socks to go to a drunken homeless person.

Karma wise the only correct answer is Union Gospel Mission. Google will tell you how to donate. Among Seattle's homelesss they are the sock gods! They have real thick wool socks they hand out with sandwiches.

&#x200B; You can probably call the Bailey Boushay House (for homeless people with HIV) or a Mary’s place or jubilee shelter (women’s shelters), or Lambert House (for gay teens), or just walk up to any line outside one of the churches serving dinner and ask if anyone needs a pair (Bethany Presbyterian or St. Paul’s Episcopalian in upper and lower Queen Anne).  Millionair Club in Belltown https://millionairclub.org If your drunken mistake doesn't involve extra socks, consider donating money to a worthwhile charity instead of socks. Charities can make much better use of monetary donations because they are able to get bulk discounts, buy exactly the things they need the most, pay their staff (you can't pay staffers with socks), etc.

Read https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/08/how-donate-wisely-after-disaster for some more tips. Your nearest homeless shelter [removed] WeCount is a local non profit with donation boxes around the city where you can drop off clean socks and people who need them can take some. The website [boxofsocks.org](http://www.boxofsox.org/?fbclid=IwAR3THia8t9ZwgsMUCcvVWnVmr5PGhuS3sJToT6cz4DWj7-pzhBfrigHJa_I#location) has a map with locations for the boxes. They're blue-painted newspaper dispenser-type boxes, except you put socks in them. They [look like this](https://imgur.com/a/67kzA7j). It might be better to donate money, honestly.  The funds will go to the most urgent needs.

A big shelter like the Union Gospel Mission probably has cheaper ways to get socks than you do. I think he's saying he got drunk and did things he regrets, and as personal reconciliation, he would like to donate some socks to the homeless in need.

On the other hand, I have 6 drunkenly ordered tubes of glowsticks at home waiting for someone to throw a rave-esque party...so drunken sock purchases could be a realistic scenario. Haha mistake was unrelated but felt like I owed something to someone if that makes sense. Donating socks was the first thing to come to mind because now I’m thinking I might’ve saw the segment about it on king 5. I appreciate the suggestion. I’ll look up union gospel mission. Thanks! Hello, I'm the friendly neighborhood /r/Seattle Automoderator robot!  You seem to have posted a comment with a link to Facebook.com or images from Facebook. Unfortunately, this can cause substantial privacy issues for both Reddit and Facebook users. Most major subreddits block this sort of content, and we do as well in /r/Seattle.

*Why do we remove Facebook links?* Here's an answer we've posted before:

> "The basic gist is that in the past people following Facebook links have been tied to their Reddit username breaking their anonymity, so it's safer to just disallow. There's also some concerns about the sheer firepower of Reddit, and that you could get dozens or hundreds or thousands of eyes onto parts of Facebook where the users or participants may not want that attention. A lot of subreddits just restrict it to play it safe."

If this was in error and you did NOT link to Facebook content, please **[click here to message the /r/Seattle moderator team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSeattle)**.  Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Seattle) if you have any questions or concerns.* That makes total sense to me. Philanthropy leads to redemption or maybe it doesn't. 

Who cares! I guarantee that you'll feel good about it.
