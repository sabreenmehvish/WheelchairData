Seattle breaks ground on 102 new affordable housing units for homeless  [deleted] Great, all we need is roughly 36,000 more. Would you rather see the homeless population increase?

The number may be around 12,000 but the people at risk who receive help are around 30k/year.

Housing first is a proven method of ending a person's cycle of chronic homelessness. A year here could help them find independence. [deleted] Band-aid on the bullet wound of capitalism. > Housing first is a proven method of ending a person's cycle of chronic homelessness

For people who are homeless because of economic issues, yes it certainly is.

Unfortunately most of Seattle's homeless are that way *by choice*, either due to mental illness or preference for living life high on opiods. These people will not move into housing, or will leave shortly after doing so.

It worked great in Salt Lake but their homelessness problem was not the same as ours is. It's a nice thought but today we have vacant "affordable" apartments and organizations with the money to give homeless people. And those apartments still go empty. We need more homes but let's not pretend they are going to reduce the homeless population.  12,112. But there are approximately 36,000 in all of WA State.

Also, those numbers usually don't take into account people that live in vehicles. Lol, as if socialism was working better. Actually about 1,000 people refuse help because they are not clean and sober. If the system were changed to accommodate people, without letting them use drugs or alcohol in the living facility, more people would move into permanent housing. That model was first used by a group of nuns back East that purchased an old motel and let street drunks sleep/pass out in the rooms. They were not allowed to drink or use drugs while in the facility but they could hit it as soon as they were outside. > Unfortunately most of Seattle's homeless are that way by choice, either due to mental illness or preference for living life high on opiods

Got some stats for that? Did you just say most of Seattle’s homeless are by choice and st the same time because of mental illness in the same sentence?
🧐🤔seems contradictory  It didn’t really work in SLC. A quick search will show SLC is as bad as ever. Most of those media reports were biased due to faulty data, covered here. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-corinth/think-utah-solved-homeles_b_9380860.html [deleted] Legally, unless someone is an immediate danger to themselves or others, they have to *want* to be treated for mental illness. They have the right to refuse treatment otherwise, even if it is the illness itself which prevents them from seeking treatment. 

Obviously the morality of the system is super debatable but it's the reality we live in and have to work within. Yes, and Seattle is in WA State, in case you didn't know. I don’t see how lumping people with mental health issues and disabilities with the “opiate addicts who *want* to be homeless,” is a fair, informed or even humane way to do it. [deleted] Never said there were 36,000 homeless in Seattle. I said they are in WA Sate. Hard to believe you don't know the difference between a State and a City, especially one you claim to live in.

And I've lived here for almost 20 years now.

Shithead.
