What to do about wheelchair? It always veers to the right whenever driving it and the big right wheel squeaks as it moves. Any ideas on what to do? take it to the bike shop or call your wheelchair vendor
 Depending on the type of wheels you have, either the wheel bearings need cleaned and regreased or replaced if they are the sealed type.

Post a picture and maybe I could talk you thru it. Wish you were local to me. I'd come over and show you how. On mine the squeaking was a bearing and the veering was a motor issue. If you end up needing replacement parts, check eBay or Craigslist before paying full price.
