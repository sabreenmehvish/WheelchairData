California ADA Compliance? I use a wheelchair and can't leave my 2nd floor apartment So, like the title says, I live on the second floor of an apartment building in Southern California.  I've lived here for about 8 years now, and began using a wheelchair 6 years ago.  There's no wheelchair access to the second floor so for the most part I'm not able to leave my apartment.  I've been out of my apartment maybe 5 times in the past 2 years, and those times were for doctors appointments.  

I can stand and walk, but for only about a minute, as it's incredibly painful.

I have no way of getting my wheelchair downstairs in normal circumstances. 

Is the complex I live in legally obligated to provide a way for me to be able to do that?  Any action I should pursue?  Thanks for any advice.   Definitely not. Depending on when the building was built and if they are granted government subsidies, they might be obligated to have CERTAIN areas (like a common area) wheelchair accessible, but they do not have to build a lift or elevator.

No offense, but why have you not moved to the ground floor or another building in the last 6 years? Can I offer some potential practical advice in the interim? Pick up a second foldable wheelchair, frequently available for free from senior centers, craigslist or for a few dollars from local thrift stores. (I’ve found several this way for people in need.)  Lock it up with a good sturdy bike lock and your landlords permission at the bottom of the stairs. Use a towel and butt-scoot your way up and down the stairs by sitting down and sliding up and down them one at a time to get in and out, or use crutches on the way up and down depending on the source of your disability and pain levels.  

It’s not elegant, but it something that worked for me when I was stuck in a wheelchair staying on a second floor apartment for a while.  > lived here for 8 years

Have you talked to the complex management yet? If so, what did they say? Because you moved in when you had no need for accommodations, but you need them now. 

Aside from that, how large is the complex? As others have said, the management is not compelled to make a private dwelling ADA compliant. Your best option is to ask them for a ground level apartment but this might reset any rent control you have in place... be sure that isn't the case before making the move.

Otherwise, and I know this might sound stupid, but is it possible for you to keep a second wheelchair on the ground level and crawl up and down the steps when you want to leave the house? It sounds like you aren't totally disabled and would be able to manage this. I know it's not dignified but leaving the house only 5 times in 2 years is pretty alarming. Talk to the building manager. If you've been a good tenant and paid on time and not caused trouble, they have a tremendous interest in keeping you.

They would probably be thrilled to put you in the first floor apartment as soon as the current tenant is gone and if the current first floor tenant has been making problems, they might even boot him/her out early.

Just tell them that you can't actually leave your current apartment and would really like to move down to the first floor instead of having to move out. I wouldn't make any noise about the ADA because they will probably start thinking you'll cost them thousands of dollars, when all you really want is an apartment with no stairs. What about something like this?

I know it's a bit pricey (and supposedly not available in the US yet, although the article is two years old and does mention they're trying to get approval), but it's cheaper than buying a house. Surely there must be some option like that available? I'm by no means an ADA expert. But my understanding is that the ADA does not apply to properties that are strictly residential. [removed] That's what I figured, thanks.  I was having a discussion about this and thought I'd ask.  It would changed my life.  I haven't moved for two reasons.  One is cost.  Prices began skyrocketing and apartments around here became unaffordable pretty quickly, unless I wanted to live in much sketchier areas.  I could have moved to a downstairs apartment, but my neighbors here are loud, very loud.  Living on the second floor, in the corner is hard enough, on the bottom floor I'd be getting even less sleep, which is already a problem for me.

We kind of lucked out in finding this apartment.  It's a corner unit and our downstairs neighbor has been understanding about my sleep deprivation and need for quiet past midnight.  The rest of the building, not a chance.  It's a warzone at night.  

We're trying to move / buy a house, but again, really expensive here in Cali.  It's taking a long time.  We have about 2 more years of saving to come up with a down payment on a modest house, but even then prices are climbing, so who knows.  I've actually looked for something portable / foldable, but my pain is in  my spine, so I'd need a full back chair that's tilted a certain angle.  After years of trying different chairs I've found only my wheelchair and my recliner that I can sit in for more than a few minutes, so I'm also limited on what's out there.  Another idea I had was getting something called an Easy Carrier.  It's a very small plastic trailer, but I think those are about $3k plus the cost of another wheelchair.  I just don't have that.   I haven't specifically asked for accommodations, but management does know I use a wheelchair.  I'm not sure what they could do, but I'd definitely talk to them before pursuing anything.  The complex has about 30 or more apartments. Continuing this idea, it might be feasible and not too expensive to hire someone to carry OP down the stairs.  What about those chairs that go up and down stairs on the wall? I've seen infomercials of them targeted towards older people that can't use the stairs No need to crawl, I can stand / walk, but just for about a minute before the pain becomes intolerable.  The only issue is where I would keep the second wheelchair.  There's really nowhere I can store it.  The managers office is tiny and isn't open all the time, there are no sheds or storage spaces, and our parking spaces are uncovered, otherwise that would be a solid idea.  We've been told we're actually the only tenants who pay early or on time, so we're well liked, but the problem is I couldn't actually handle living on the first floor.  In order of priorities for me sleep comes first.  I'm already very sleep deprived because of the pain and other issues, living on the first floor with how much noise people make here, it would wreak havoc.   >around US$16,320

Ouch.  Yeah, there's no way I'd be able to afford that.  Medicare helps pay for medically necessary wheelchairs, but it's pretty limited in what you can get.  I've looked at other similar options, but yeah, they're all out of my affordability.   Eh... it's kind of a mess.

It normally does not apply to dwellings themselves, but it does to the common areas such as office, parking lots, pools, etc. The FHAA (related legislation) applies to ground units only (unelss it's a townhouse) built after 1991. The ADA has similar construction date requirements, but is fairly lenient on older buildings except that disabled residents are generally allowed to do their own appropriate modifications.

If OP's complex was built in 1972 with no wheelchair ramp, narrow hallways, and round doorknobs they would become compliant by changing the doorknobs and possibly (if it was simple and required no special efforts) adding a ramp. No dwelling changes would be required, but OP could install shower handles and maybe a chair lift at their own expense. *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

Do not reply to this message as a comment.* I'm sorry you're going through this. Maybe contact the HUD to see if they can help locating another place to live that would fit your needs or to see if any governmenr assistance programs are available for you. I understand you like where you are now, but if there's a fire can you get out quickly? You would probably adjust better being on the first floor.  I know you are saying your neighbors are really loud but you would then have access to the entire neighborhood.  You would tire yourself out faster in a natural way getting out of the house.  It could actually improve your sleep by getting more exercise and seeing things / experiencing life around your home.  Also noisy neighbors can be dealt with in other ways.  They probably don't even know they're being so loud, they likely don't even know you exist if you haven't left in 2+ years. 2 years of saving to get to 20%? Or to 5% down?

Buy at 5% down if you can swing the higher mortgage payments, and refinance when you have some equity. The price increases don't have an end in sight here in CA. Not legal advice, but have you considered asking your downstairs neighbor if they would be willing to switch apartments with you? Talk to them and see what they can do.

Most commonly, they'll put you in a 1st-floor unit with wheelchair-accessible countertops (lower) and wider doorframes. [removed] I wouldn't trust people not to abuse and break one of those in very short order. They're meant for inside your house.  Probably time to move then.

Sorry. Have you tried earplugs like [any of these?](https://snorezing.com/best-earplugs-snoring/) I used similar cheap ones when my neighborhood was doing some construction that started early in the morning (I worked closing shift at a restaurant). They work fantastically. Most smartwatches or fitbit type things you can set an alarm on that will "tap" you to wake up, so you don't have to worry about that either. 

This way you could move into a more accessible apartment. Heck, even if you don't move it would likely still help with your quality of life, but it could enable you to really *live.* Couldn’t you make noise complaints against the neighbors at your nonemergency PD hotline, and when hey quiet it down at night finally feel ok to move? That's too bad :( 

Maybe crowd funding would help? Thanks, I think there probably are programs I'd qualify for, but from what I've read in the past about them they have very long waiting lists and are meant more for people who can't afford anywhere to live.  I'd fall under that category if I were living alone, but I live with my sister who also takes care of me, so it's a more ideal situation. 

Just need to get through 2 more years.   I'd be able to get out quickly, yes.  I would just be in a whole lot of pain without my wheelchair.   We've made noise complaints time and again, and it'll stop for a day or two, but then it just goes to back to the way it was.  For the most part it's really unintentional, people just living their daily lives, but the apartment walls are really thin, and our windows may as well not even exist.  

This is pretty much a norm for apartment complexes in our price range.  In fact, we wouldn't even be able to find anything comparable for what we're paying.



Definitely it would improve my sleep by being able to go out and experience life, but knowing what keeps me from sleeping, I know that I'd have a harder time below someone.  This is from experience.   Right now the goal is to stick it out another couple of years so we can afford to move, but it would have been nice to find a way to make it work with my current living situation.   2 more years of saving would get us to 20% plus a small safety net.  We've looked into buying at 5%, but we don't feel safe with the higher payments.  It's doable, but risky if we lose a source of income.  And yeah, those prices are killing me.  Every time I look it gets worse and worse.   Thanks, yeah, I really don't think there's much else they'd be able to do.  It isn't because I'm timid, shy, or not acting like an adult by not having asked for accommodations.  It's because I can't offer a suggestion of what they could do besides moving me to a downstairs apartment, which really wouldn't benefit me.  I already use a sound machine, earplugs, and heavy black out curtains every night, and that's on the second floor.  Unebbing pain and other issues make it very hard for me to fall asleep and stay asleep, and the apartments here don't dampen sound very well. I'd be much worse off. I speak from experience.  



I appreciate the encouragement, but the situation is more complicated than I've probably made it seem from my initial post.  I also deal with a compromised immune system and other health issues that make going down to offices and such a problem.  Even then, I can't think of any suggestions aside from moving.  Yup, definitely.  [I actually can't go a night without them](https://imgur.com/a/rnV3K) (The Softstar ones are less irritating to the ear canal btw, just as an aside).  I also have a white noise machine and air purifier running at night.  It helps, but it doesn't block out the stomping or thumping noises.  I'm an extremely light sleeper. ;) It doesn’t hurt to contact them anyway, even if there’s a long wait list they can possibly assist you in finding affordable housing. Also due to your disability you are likely entitled to other benefits. 

Good luck HUD where I live rent is based off of your income with a a sliding scale.

If your sister is your caregiver she may not count towards your rent income, but be aware she will not be listed on a HUD rental agreement. That means if something happened to you she would only have 2 weeks (per state HUD guidelines) to move.

The building I live in has a few people paying full rent because of their income, but I would say most pay a bit to a lot less.

Check out your options, the sooner you get your paperwork in the sooner you move up in the list. How about 10%? The penalty for putting less money down *might* be outweighed by the skyrocketing value of homes. We decided to bite the bullet and buy just to get our foot in the door, knowing we can't time the market.  [removed] Oh wow, that's all the things. Best of luck to you! True, I suppose I can give a call on Monday and see if there's anything that could help.  The cabin fever has been steadily getting worse.  Anyway, thanks.   Interesting, that I didn't know.  I wonder if I'd still be able allowed a 2 bedroom considering she wouldn't be on the rental agreement.  I'll have to check it out, thanks. It doesn't look like it changed much going from 5-10%, but at 20% it becomes very noticeable. Especially with the lack of mortgage insurance.  It's pretty aggravating.  We're thinking about saving as much as possible for 2 years then maybe renting a house instead until prices come down / crash.  So much risk though, it could be another 20 years before that happens.  If only it were that easy.  Housing in Southern California is pretty insane right now. Thank you. You won't be allowed a 2 bedroom unless she is on the lease.

 The thing we realized about mortgage insurance is this: If your house appreciates in line with recent home value increases, a combination of payments and appreciation will allow you to get out of mortgage insurance in 2-3 years instead of 8-9 (payments alone). We expect to be able to have it removed within 2ish years of home purchase due to the market.  [removed] If we could get out of it in 3 or so years that would be much more doable.  I'm assuming that would be a traditional and not FHA loan though?  The rates would be pretty high woudln't they?  We were almost going to purchase with a 5% loan a year ago, and an FHA loan with our credit would have given us an amazing rate.  Something like 3.5%.  Traditional would have been over 4% at the time.  I think now it's even higher.   And you're naive with a lack of experience.  Full of excuses?  This is what I've been dealing with for years.  Have you ever lived or dealt with disability housing?  I like how people like you, healthy and happy think you can "man up" and deal with a situation you know nothing about.  You don't know anything about me or what I go through on a daily basis, so if you think I'm making excuses or being lazy, or lacking drive you know nothing.  Ours is 4% including mortgage insurance, but that rate was locked in last year. Probably 4.5 with good credit now if you include MI. Ours has MI rolled in with the interest rate, so the MI actually ends up being tax deductible since it's counted as interest. And yes, ours is conventional.  [removed] Nice, I didn't know that's how it worked.  I'll have to look into it more now.  If we can get rid of the mortgage insurance that soon it might actually be possible.  Anyway, thanks for the insight.  I appreciate everyone's comments here, they're looking to help, but the suggestions have revolved around moving, which I've said isn't possible for me at this time.  




As for moving out of California, I can't even respond to that.  It's unrealistic.  I live with my sister who's also my caregiver.  Is she supposed to move too?  Leave her job and hope to find a new one?   And who's paying for all of this?  For our loan, yes. Other loans have separate MI that isn't rolled into the interest. There is such a huge diversity of loan programs out there that it's worth investigating every conventional option/product.
