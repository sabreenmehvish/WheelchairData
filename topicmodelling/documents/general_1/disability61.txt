Why do people in wheelchairs wear shoes? Sorry if this is an insensitive question but you're not walking anywhere so why not just go barefoot? In cases where people don't use their feet, it keeps them protected. Even in a chair you can stub your toes, I use my footplate (the bit your feet sit on) to push doors open and would regularly bop my toes without shoes. Additionally you kick up a lot of dirt in a chair, shoes help keep your feet clean. 

No-one is in their chair 24/7, if you have to transfer out of your chair to get into a car for example, your feet may end up on the ground. Also an issue in public toilets, and man you don't want your bare feet on those floors!

There are many chair users who have some lower body movement but can't walk for whatever reason. Some of them use their feet to brake or help push along the chair, push open a door etc. 

And last but not least; fashion. Shoes are a fashion choice for men and women, and outfits look much more complete with a set of shoes on the bottom. It's a little socially weird to go out in your bare feet unless you're on the beach! Not all do at all times.  My stepfather buys cow hooves on Halloween and screws them onto the bottoms of his prostheses instead of feet.  That and tasteful red contacts make for an awesome costume. My experience is that I like to feel "normal" in every other respect outside my use of a chair. If I was also not wearing shoes then I'm sure kids would be the first to point out the "abnormality" of not wearing shoes. None of this really would bother me, but constant reminders of being different aren't really that fun after a while. I can walk, limited distances. I stand up to transfer to and from my car. Also I hate feet, even my own. Summer is hell.  My mom wears shoes, shes a diabetic and the last thing you want in that situation is an injured foot, if you are riding in a chair/scooted or walking. The floor in disabled toilets can often be covered in urine, wouldn’t want to put my bare feet in that! Diabetic. I still transfer out/in the chair, need shoe for strong pivot plus being diabetic, gotta protect feet from injury. I have a prosthetic leg, so I can walk but still use chair sometimes, and when not wearing leg. Some people in wheelchair can actually walk (like me) it’s just a hassle or tiring , also nobody wants to see your foot out  Good question. I ask myself this quite often. I suppose it's just a societal norm. Down with the man!

On a serious note, I may not walk, but I do stand occasionally and transfer, and I certainly need support for that. Protection, yes.  https://i.imgur.com/Kzuq3c9.jpg ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

How many years did that one take to heal?  RGR It probably took 6 months to heal but I had the 'luxury' of staying in bed for the better part of 3 months.  If I didn't, it would have gotten worse until I lost my foot.   That's uh 'lucky' I guess. Staying in bed for three months sucks arse but much better than having an appendage chopped off. It really is a cracker, is it just abrasion?  I didn't shift position enough on a 14 hour road drip.  A week later I had a blister the size of a silver dollar and once it broke.. that.
