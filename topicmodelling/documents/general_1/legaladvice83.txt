mother wants to divorce father, is concerned he may manipulate finances to leave her with nothing 
****Pre-edit--This is all taking place in Alabama****

So the situation is this:  my father began developing a progressive disability about two years ago. in that time he went from perfectly healthy, to requiring a walker and completely losing the ability to speak(except for horrible, loud screams, which he does often. he now uses an app on his smartphone, and texts), to needing a wheelchair sometimes, to being mostly wheelchair bound. now he's having trouble getting into a car, and cannot get in and out of bed without help.

Through all of this, my mother has helped him. Even when he demanded that she quit the job that she loved, and which she had worked her whole career to get to, to take care of him. she did it, and has been suffering ever since. she feels that she has no purpose in life now.  He has always been a controlling, alpha-male, 1950's Bing Crosby kind of husband. Fortunately for him, my mother is very submissive and tends to follow authority.

But now that he's disabled, he's gone from normal controlling, to INSANE controlling. and now he is beginning to lash out violently(last night he tried to attack me with a pair of scissors because i would not let him continue to berate and harass my mother--he takes all of his frustrations out on her, haranguing her and attacking her for every little thing. he demands to know where she is at all times, and won't let her leave the house for long periods of time. if she does not answer texts or emails immediately, he becomes furious. if she is even an hour late, god help her.  He has a pattern of physical abuse, mostly against me(he used to beat me mercilessly, for the slightest thing. i distinctly remember him trying to choke me because i refused to do something)--he would not often touch her, because in the past she would have left and gotten a divorce. now, she's so worn down that she can barely do anything(she suffers from terrible depression, and his behavior exacerbates it). I'm fairly certain that he has become physically abusive toward her again, though he's so weak he can't do much damage anyway. 

He has openly said that if she puts him in a nursing home, he will make sure that it is the most expensive nursing home possible(again, he controls all access to money).

Finally, my mother has decided she has had enough.  She wants to leave him, but as I said earlier, for most of her marriage, she has been submissive, and let him handle pretty much everything. now she is concerned about finances and access to computer data.

My father has always been very good at working with finances, and has learned a great deal about the financial system and the banking system. She is concerned that if he finds out that she is preparing to leave him, he may manipulate his holdings(which are already very, very diverse--his portfolio includes stocks, bonds, property and other investments. he only keeps around 10k in their (shared) bank account at any given time. note that the shared account is the only account my mother has access to, or any knowledge of.  He has implied that he has around 1-3 million invested in other ways. The house is in his name, as is pretty much everything with a title. 

He also knows the law very well, and that which he doesn't know for sure...well, all he can do all day is browse the internet. he can very easily become very knowledgable of divorce law, and use that against my mother. 

My mother does not want to bankrupt him. She probably does not even want  the 50 percent to which she is entitled. She just wants to make sure that, after the divorce, she has enough money to start over--buy a house, get a car, survive until she can reconnect to old business associates and get a job again. 

The other issue is technology. my father was a programmer by trade, and as such controls all technology in the house. he sets all the passwords, and he sets everything up. computers, email, everything. he has refused to even give my mother their netflix password. She is concerned that if she divorces him, she will not have access to any important files or data. 

My mother has told me that she is going to make an appointment today to speak to a lawyer, and she's asked me to come with her. Since i'm not terribly well versed in finances or law, i'd just like to know what the lawyer might propose, or what is legally possible to prevent my father from vindictively lashing out at her in the ways described.

The problem is that my father is not stupid. he is very, very smart, but in a kind of evil way, like a james bond villain. He can be very sociable and witty, and can generally make people like him. he is manipulative and passive aggressive. right now from all appearances he's just a sad, miserable man confined to a wheelchair, with nothing to live for, and now his wife is trying abandon him the second he ran into any hardship.  He knows this. He knows how to hide the screaming, controlling, aggressive lunatic, and put on a pathetic, suffering face.  > i'd just like to know what the lawyer might propose, or what is legally possible to prevent my father from vindictively lashing out at her in the ways described.

A restraining order, reporting violent episodes to the police, and a forensic accountant to find out if he's hiding money.  None of this behavior is particularly unusual for a divorce (sadly), most decent divorce attorneys can handle all of it.   Also, keep in mind that the 1-3 million may not actually exist and he says it exists to make himself look better *I am a bot whose sole purpose is to improve the timeliness and accuracy of responses in this subreddit.*

He knows this. He knows how to hide the screaming, controlling, aggressive lunatic, and put on a pathetic, suffering face.  Agreed-and if your father has been filing honest tax returns it will be pretty easy to find his assets. If he has been filing fraudulent returns it will be a little more difficult but the court will not think highly of him when it comes time to rule on diving up the assets If he says it exists, it exists. Maybe more.  He has kept us mostly closed off from the finances, but I've seen enough to know an approximate minimum.
