First parking ticket. I feel it was unjust. What do you think? [Solved] Turns out there IS a one foot rule. Thanks

[Columbus, Ohio] Today I received a parking ticket and the infraction listed on the ticket says "1ft whlchr ramp." Now I realize it is illegal to park directly in front of a wheelchair ramp but I hardly consider myself blocking the ramp. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/3tztu) is a picture of my parking. There is a driveway to the right of the sign prompting the "no stopping," and I have the proper permit to park on the street. Correct me if I'm wrong but I do not believe I am blocking this ramp. 

Which makes me wonder if there is some specific law stating you can't park within a certain distance of one. I've only done some light digging so far with no luck. It's a $55 ticket which isn't that bad if I felt I had actually done something wrong. I know a lot of people just pay the ticket as they don't want to bother appealing but for someone who doesn't have a lo of money to blow it may be worth it to me and my pride, mostly pride.

All the information on the ticket is correct and I have 10 days to either pay the ticket or appeal. What do you guys think? [Here you go](https://www.municode.com/library/oh/columbus/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT21TRCO_CH2151PAGE_2151.01PAPRSPPL)

TRAF. 2151.01 (1)(aa)

>(1) No person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle except when necessary to avoid conflict with any other traffic or to comply with the directions of a police officer or a traffic control device in any of the following places:

>(aa) In front of, or within one (1) foot of, a wheelchair ramp;

And from 2101.53:

>"Wheelchair ramp" means a break in the curb of a public street, with a ramp extending away from the street, up to a public or private walkway. Such ramp to be built expressly for the use by wheelchairs. Ok - it sure looks to me that you were within one foot of the ramp although I would agree that it's iffy. 

And there is a specific law about this one foot rule. https://www.municode.com/library/oh/columbus/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT21TRCO_CH2151PAGE_2151.01PAPRSPPL Yup.

If it's any consolation others think it's bullshit too:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/2tujz9/psa_west_1st_ave_short_north_parking/ Well that's frustrating, but thank you.  I was unaware of the one foot rule. I've seen so many people park here too, I know it doesn't excuse the infraction but man that's frustrating.  The truth is - you are very close to the 1 foot mark. If you had measured it with pictures you might have been able to argue the toss. Mind you I don't know if the 1 foot rule is to the start of the cut or to the final depression. I suspect the former but I can't find a definition. Honestly the cost  to prove this one way or the other would be considerably more than the fine. Yeah I agree it *is* kind of BS to expect people to know these weird ordinances without proper signage.  And it did make me feel better seeing others frustrated. Thanks for that haha.
