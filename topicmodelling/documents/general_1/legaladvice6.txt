My doctor won’t write a letter for me i am a 64 year old woman and I receive ssdi and am considered  permanently disabled. Where I live, the water company offers a discount for individuals with disabilities. They only require a note from my primary care physician. 
My doctor will not give me a note without an office visit and his nurse told me that the doctor wants to determine whether I qualify as disabled.
I don’t get this: 1) s.s has already determined my status and 2) this note is to help me pay a bill. Both the doctor and the water company know I am disabled and the doctor just won’t cooperate.
 Sounds like the doctor is following protocol that is both ethical and legal. There's no legal issue here. The doctor is not required to write a note simply because you request it. You can't force any doctor to write any letter. He can certainly require that he examine you before making a determination like that.  He's the one signing his name after all. If the standard for a discount is done on the basis of doctors notes, and the doctor won't write you a note without an office visit (common) then you need to do an office visit. The doctor isn't doing anything illegal here.  My back pain was at some point so bad that I was wheelchair bound

My family doctor, who had known me since my childhood, including the back injury incident, still required me to visit him in person before he would sign off on the short term disability papers when the pain worsened. I managed to get to the front of his office and he came outside for an assessment (his office was not wheelchair accessible).

I believe your doctor may just be followed protocol. This is very common and shows you have a responsible, ethical physician. The doctor may want to talk to you about specifics of the request or wording of the letter, depending on need or wants to make sure his letter is being used by you, and you're not being coerced by another person, in an elder abuse situation. When my late husband, who had an obvious disability, needed documentation for various things I had to schlep him to the doctor's office for a visit to get the documentation. Would you blindly sign off on a document just because someone asked for it? My wife is a non-verbal quadriplegic. She has no functional use of her arms or legs, and she can only communicate through a Morse code communicator mounted to her wheelchair.  She has known her doctor for over 30 years.

Her doctor won't write her a prescription for a wheelchair without a face to face visit, because that's what the rules say she needs to do.

Both your doctor, and my wife's doctor are doing the right thing, no matter how inconvenient it is. ---
