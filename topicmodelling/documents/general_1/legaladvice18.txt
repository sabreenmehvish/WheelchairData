Wheelchair accessibility Long story short: 

An uncle has a disability and has to use wheelchairs at all times. He owns a Condo and uses the community sidewalks (obviously) and laundry. He’s been asking the association and administration to do ramps which they promised to do and to build a ramp for the laundry for him to be able to access it. He’s been emailing back and forth for over a year and a half and haven’t done anything. 

A month or two ago he was trying to get into the laundry (for that he has to maneuver with the wheelchair since there’s no ramp) and he fell on the floor (there were witnesses) and some people had to help him get up. The condo has yet to do anything. 


Anyone knows of a legal resource to obligate the condo to do something?  ---
