Please list them or link me to them.

I want to build a startup involving wheelchair equipment but I want  to know first have anyone already started one. I want to start my  project But don't want to waste time on the project just to find out  later that there was already one that existed.

I know that there is some patent on these equipment already and who they belong to. 

Anything related to this industry wide help.
