Emirates Airlines is refusing to give me wheelchair assistance or a refund. [EU] I'm posting this on behalf of a friend: 

I’m a wheelchair user and I had a flight from Bucharest to Dubai on the 5th of February with flyDubai , but when I requested the wheelchair assistance I was told that flydubai does not allow the aisle chair on board. I cannot walk therefore my only chance would be to crawl on the aisle or be carried by people to my seat on the 15th row (didn’t get front seats either, I was asked 150€ for them) , but I wouldn’t take this risk because maybe I will not be allowed access on the plane at all. This was a connection flight for Thailand where I’m planning to get medical treatment. Because I can’t gamble my health I booked a different flight with Qatar Airlines. The problem is that now I wont even get a full refund from flydubai/Emirates (to mention that I booked the flight via the Emirates website ). From what I know there are International protocols which disallow the airlines such discriminatory conduct. If anyone has an idea how can I take legal action against the company please message me.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

The flight was booked in Romania but the laws should be uniform across the EU.  Under EU regulation 1107/2006, it is the airport that is primarily responsible for the embarkation of persons with reduced mobility. That regulation also prohibits an air carrier from denying a passenger with reduced mobility a reservation or denying them boarding unless there's a safety issue or it is physically impossible to board them through the doors.

There was no discriminatory conduct.

The airport and air carrier were obligated to get you on the plane or make alternative arrangements. You chose not to assert your rights under the regulation with the original carrier and made a different booking. Because you were not denied a reservation or denied boarding, the EU regulation was not violated. ---

LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) Yeah, that makes perfect sense. I assume they tried to scare him into canceling the reservation so they don't have to deal with the hassle. We'll see if they offer a full refund or not.  > We'll see if they offer a full refund or not.

They only owe you whatever refund was agreed upon while purchasing tickets - what did the contract that your friend agreed to say about refunds?

Depending on the type of fare, your refund could range from 0 to 100% of the original price paid.
