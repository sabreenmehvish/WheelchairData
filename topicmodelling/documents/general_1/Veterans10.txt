My friend, a paralyzed vet, got this wicked cool all-terrain wheelchair. Complete with gun rack.  That's pretty awesome. 

Kudos to the people who did that for him. He looks so happy in those pictures. This should not be news so much as a (more) regular occurance in my opinion. worth it.  FUCK YES I could not agree more! One step at a time I guess. No pun intended :)
