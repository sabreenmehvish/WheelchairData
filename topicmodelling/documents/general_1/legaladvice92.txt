Unique Situation (Illustration Inside): Other Driver Hit Wheelchair and Tried To Blame Car (not involved in impact) For Being in "No Stopping" Zone [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/SDgZZMA.png)

This happened in Maryland, USA

Friend A stops partially in no stopping zone and leaves car running with no driver, just two passengers as he runs to corner shop. 

Perpendicularly, another car pulls out to turn right and bumps into a woman in a motorized wheelchair, who is lawfully crossing the street at the crosswalk (there is a stop sign there). As my friend comes back to the car, the guy in the silver car comes and starts asking for his insurance info and says that he is to blame for the whole ordeal. Silver driver mentions that he is a former "Military Police Officer" and states that it is illegal to leave the scene of an accident. However, my friend's car didn't touch another car or person at all, so it was not involved in the collision. Thus, he simply told the silver driver that he was wrong and drove off. Should he be worried or was the silver driver simply trying to shift the blame. 

I should mention that the silver driver admitted to bumping into the wheelchair woman, which meant that he had to have simply run a stop sign, and that subsequently the woman didn't ask for my friend's information at all, only the silver driver. He is freaking out because he's a really safe driver and wasn't even in a car at the time of the accident, would any legal experts have any insight into the situation?

Thank you very much Your friend is fine, he was not involved in a collision and did not need to provide his personal information to anyone. Silver car was just a douche. Are you sure you've got the diagram right? Your friend was parked and the other driver was approaching on another road? The other driver's view of the intersection wasn't blocked by your friends car? If everything you've written and diagrammed is correct I can't see how your friend could be in any way liable. I **suppose** it's possible that the other driver was confused about whether your friend car was approaching but since he had to stop anyway, that's more than a bit of a red-herring. When you stop at a stop sign you not only have to look out for other road users, but also pedestrians. *I am a bot whose sole purpose is to improve the timeliness and accuracy of responses in this subreddit.*

 Well I hope that's the case because the silver driver wrote down his plate He blamed my friend for being stopped there because in his opinion, he had to pull forward into the intersection as opposed to stopping and waiting at the stop sign. But honestly he hit a slow-moving old woman in a power wheelchair as she was in a crosswalk plainly visible from his sedan. The only reason my friend is freaking out is because the silver driver was in a new mercedez and likely has the means to pursue some bullshit litigation.

Also I believe there is some law about positive identification of a driver in a "Hit and run" scenario. There was no one sitting in the driver's seat in my friend's car at the time. It was in idle and in park. 
 The fact that he had to edge his way out to see if someone was coming doesn't absolve the silver car driver from checking to see if he had a pedestrian or a wheel chair user in front of him if he had to do that. And I fail to see how your friend being illegally parked (and he was, so tell him not to do that in future) changed that situation. Sheesh. Incidentally, does the road your friend was on also have a stop sign at that intersection?

I suspect that what your friend is dealing with is a person who over-reacted in the heat of the moment. Post again if he actually gets some kind of civil suit over this.
