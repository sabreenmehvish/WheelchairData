Old Vietnam vets My next door neighbors (brothers)are a couple of old Vietnam vets. One is in a wheelchair and the other has all the problems that comes with jungle warfare. 
Their truck is broken down and I've reached out to a BUNCH of organizations that raise money for vets. So far I haven't found any that will help them. 
I could use some guidance. I hate to be that guy but they have used up all my help.
 I think it's really cool you are trying to help them out.  Can I ask what state you are in?  From my experience allot of states have there own specialized programs and some of the bigger cities and towns follow but it can be extremely hard getting help if you are in an area that doesn't offer anything.  The Red Cross has some resources specifically for veterans if you have one nearby.  Let me do some research and see if I can't come up with something.   You weren't kidding about the lack of resources in your area.  I'm waiting to get through to one other organization.   Macon Ga. I feel sorry for them but when you live next door to folks with substance abuse problems you have to be hard or they will take advantage. I appreciate your help.  I appreciate the help. It amazes me how many organizations collect donations and when you reach out to them are no help.  Completely understand and you can only do so much.  People have to help themselves and substance abuse makes everything that much harder and messy.  I'll let you know what I find.  Hopefully you can point them in the right direction and make peace with it.  Sux being stuck in that position.   Shoutout for Macon! Best of luck.  I have some heard back nothing :(. Its sad how hard is getting to find real help in real time.
