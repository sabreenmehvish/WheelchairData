(FL) Was recently in an accident involving a pedestrian but was likely not at fault. I was driving down a narrow roadway when a person in a motorized wheelchair with no hazard lights or reflectors appeared and suddenly slammed into her. Before the accident i was following all applicable traffic laws and i was not speeding. Would I be ruled to be at least partly negligent? EDIT forgot to mention that there was no marked crosswalk at all.  Wheelchairs aren't motor vehicles; they don't have to have hazard lights or reflectors, they get to cross the street just like any other pedestrian, you're always required to yield to them even if they're jaywalking, etc.

In theory they could be held completely at fault, but that's pretty unlikely. I don't know the details of your case, but plan on being held at least partly at fault. It happens. The part about the wheelchair suddenly appearing sounds pretty fishy. Typically when someone says that they hit a pedestrian that “suddenly” appeared it’s because they were either distracted (even a tenth of a second is enough) or speeding, or both.

There’s not enough information to guess whether you would be found liable; I would prepare for that eventuality though, and talk to your insurance company about this just to make sure that your bases are covered. Forgot to mention that there was no marked or unmarked crosswalk and it happened between intersections.
