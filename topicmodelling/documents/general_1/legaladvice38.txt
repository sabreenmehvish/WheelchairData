want to help others with a powered wheelchair \[California\] I have a fully powered, fully controllable wheelchair.  I want to do the most good with it I can.

I would love to give it to someone who needs it, but I also know that most people in need can't afford such.  I would hate to give it to someone and then have one of their heirs then sell it on ebay or something of the sort.

Can I put together some sort of contract that it would have to be returned after death?  I know that sounds horrible in one sense, but I want this to help as many people as possible while its functional as possible.  I want to remain anonymous in all of this, if possible.

Any ideas of whether or not a contract could be put in place?  Or would it be better to just let it go and let humanity take its course? Why not donate it to a local nursing home or something that would be likely to reuse it over and over?

I don't know a lot about contract law, but what you are describing sounds like you are renting the wheelchair out. There might be some issues with that as far as things like liability and such. Better just to find a good home for it and feel good about your good deed.  ---

LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) Setup a lease for it. Charge $1 or 1c/month. 

Donate it to a rehabilitation facility

Note. I manage the rental/loan program at a large rehab hospital. We always need more equipment  What you want to do is to rent or lease it out to someone for zero cost and still retain ownership of the wheelchair? What if it is damaged or destroy? Many legal questions.

Best to just donate it to a charity or aid organization.
