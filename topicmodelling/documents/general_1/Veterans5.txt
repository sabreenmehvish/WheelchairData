VA Provided Power Wheelchair question I was issued a Pride Quantum Q6 Edge rehab wheelchair back in May 2015, and received it in August.  It has been in the shop 3 times since. I have had the footrest and all outer casters replaced twice; the right motor, batteries, and controller replaced twice; and the wiring harnesses and left motor replaced once. I don't take the chair off road, it has been sidewalks, buses and in-home use only. Obviously, this chair isn't rugged enough for my use.  How do I request eval for a different chair? I'd probably start with the provider who prescribed the chair. Or, with Prosthetics.  There should be someone in prosthetics/orthopedics who did the measuring and fitting for your wheelchair. Or your original prescribing provider, like NEHOG mentioned
