The VA's stand made some sense (at least in most cases) in that someone who is in palliative care frequently doesn't need mobility devices.   [deleted] >That's more the meat of the matter, I think. I also see their point: if he's in hospice, why is he wheeling and tooling around? 

Hospice is for any terminal illness. There are drugs, resources, therapies, and philosophies of care which can benefit them in their final days. Hospice isn't just about pushing morphine.

Some people improve on hospice. They are graduated out of the program until such a time as it becomes appropriate again. Your last paragraph is categorically, factually, and literally incorrect [deleted] Um? I disagree with your last paragraph. And my statement is a fact.
