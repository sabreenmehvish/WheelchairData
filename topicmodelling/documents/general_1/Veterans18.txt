Hello, son of a disabled veteran (who is now 56 years old)here inquiring about ch 35 Dependants Educational Assistance. As the title suggests, I'm hoping I could get some clarity on the qualifications regarding this. My father is 56 going on 57 and was injured during his time in the Air Force back in the 80's. This was a career ending injury, but didn't prevent him from pursuing other jobs up until 2012 where the injury and his age caught up to him and rendered him unable to walk without assistance (walkers and wheelchairs).  We live off VA financial assistance now.

I am 19 years old and I'm hoping to go to college in August for further clarification. I'm willing to answer any questions. I just really need to figure this out so I can plan things out going forward The first question is, are you even eligible based upon the status of your dad? Your post isn't specific enough to determine that. ("Living off of VA financial assistance" is not precise enough.) From the VA website:

[https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/Dep\_Edu\_Assist\_Chapter\_35.asp](https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/Dep_Edu_Assist_Chapter_35.asp)

Eligible individuals are Veterans’ and Servicemembers’ dependents, spouses and surviving spouses who have been found eligible by the Regional Processing Office (RPO) because of one of the following:

* The Veteran’s death was caused by the service-connected disability
* The Veteran is rated for total and permanent service-connected disability
* The Servicemember is Missing in Action (MIA)
* The Servicemember is captured in the line of duty
* The Servicemember is forcibly detained for longer than 90 days
* The Servicemember who VA determines has a service-connected permanent and total disability that will result in a discharge from military service
* Participants include a dependent child between the ages of 14 to 31 and a spouse, or surviving spouse, who qualifies for the benefit Some states also offer financial assistance to the children of disabled veterans - your state government website will have this information as will colleges in your state. Thank you for replying to this post. 

My dad is not rated for total and permanent service connected disability, but he's trying to get that changed due to his quickly deteriorating condition (strongly related to his disability).

 I'm not too sure on what specific financial assistance we receive, but it probably has something to do with his injury.  From what it looks like, my state (WV) doesn't have any benefits programs for children of disabled veterans. Thank you for the suggestion though Until he gets that rating (and assuming he doesn't meet any of the other criteria) then you do not qualify for Chapter 35 assistance.

Nobody's going to really be able to tell you how likely it is he's going to be found P&T or how long it's going to take. Even if he were already eligible, lining up Chapter 35 benefits in time for starting college in August is probably unrealistic just due to how slow the VA moves in general. If you are intent on attending in August, you'll need to finance it another way.

/u/scoveteranandretired posted a good suggestion to look into local benefits (state, county, etc) as sometimes certain municipalities will offer tuition assistance for disabled vets and their dependents generally. ::EDIT:: There's probably also scholarships for this sort of a thing that you could look into as well. I know it doesnt help you, but others find this later. WV does offer free tuition to children of vets that died in service. Age restriction is 16-23.

Ive never looked into the specifics but this may help.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_senior_military_college

"Cadets at an SMC are authorized to take the ROTC program all four years, but taking a commission upon graduation remains optional, unlike other colleges where ROTC cadets are required to sign a contract to take commission before entering their final two years."

I dont know if that means you have to pay back the tuition or it was a free ride. I just looked and couldn't find any benefits that I'd qualify for sadly The Senior Military Colleges are a very different kettle of fish from getting the VA to pay for school.  They’re also not free.  The Citadel is $50k annually, out of state. If you’re on an ROTC scholarship, it should covers room and board, or tuition and fees.  Also, if you’re on scholarship, you’re going to commission unless you’re found medically unfit, etc. 

That Wikipedia article means that if you’re paying out of pocket, you can participate in ROTC for four years at the SMC and not have to commission, which is different from the civilian university programs.  You could always join the military and earn your own benefits... Got it thanks. 
I've never looked into it. I simply remember hearing something about it years ago.
