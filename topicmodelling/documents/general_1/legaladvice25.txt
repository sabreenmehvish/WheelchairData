Apartment building has turned off all elevators; Cannot get off floor (Missisauga, Ontario) I have a friend who lives in a Condo Highrise on the 40th floor and all the elevators have been turned off; there is a poster stating all elevators will be off for 48 hours due to a water leak from an apartment on the 3rd floor. 

My friend has a kid in a wheelchair and is unable to take the stairs down; no one is answering at the management office. 

Is there anything my friends can do? Or any services they could call? 

It's right before a long weekend. 

Location: Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.

Update:
From what they were told a unit across from the elevators had a flood occur from pipe; water leaked out of the unit and went into the elevator shafts.

All elevators have been turned off until repairs can be done I would actually contact [code enforcement](http://www.ontarioca.gov/code-enforcement/residential-code-compliance-program) to see if they have an issue with the elevators being out. If they're out due to a legitimate electrical issue, I'm not certain there's much the landlord can do. Hey there, I’m a paramedic in Mississauga.

I have no help for you in regards to turning the elevators back on.

But just to let you know, if your son absolutely needs to get downstairs, the paramedics have a stair chair that glides down stairs, making it really easy to get any person down stairs.

If there is anywhere else you and your son could stay for the next while, this is a great way to get him downstairs safely. I would try harassing the office and demanding to be put up in a motel for the time being, seeing as how there is zero access for your son. But if the repairs are going to be done in a day or two, you may be better off just waiting it out.

Don’t bother calling the fire department, they’ll just call the paramedics because they don’t have stairchairs.

Best of luck! >My friend has a kid in a wheelchair and is unable to take the stairs down; no one is answering at the management office.

 They should contact the fire department. Now. That's dangerous and terrible.  [deleted] [removed] Call. The. Fire. Department. Immediately. 

This is an emergency. A person is literally trapped in a building. My apologies; I have updated the location.

I will google for applicable Code enforcement in the city they live in. [removed] Yeah there must be a code violation in that. At the very least the fire department could help her get him down and out of the building into a proper hotel for safety while mom sorts out the legality.  
>Where I live all of the city offices and schools that have stairs have evacuation chairs in every building. It's a folding chair with two wheels and a handle that can be used to take people up or down stairs. 

For Arnold Schwarzenegger to take people up and down stairs?  Could the average person really manage this? YOUR COMMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED.

noun
a serious, unexpected, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action.

I fail to see how this is an emergency Why. Are. You. So. Dramatic? Literally dramatic.

This isn’t an emergency, just an inconvenience at best. Before you go on about “what if there’s a fire?!”, remember that elevators are generally shut down in the event of a fire alarm. So regardless, anyone in a wheelchair is stuck upstairs and will have to be carried out.

No one is sick, dying, or in danger. This isn’t an emergency. While the building manager(s) are certainly morons, this person stuck in the building is not in medical distress and presumably has food and water. [removed] Seems kind of bizarre that this could even be allowed to happen. I'm not familiar with Canadian disability or fire law, but it seems like something was overlooked here if a person with extreme mobility issues was allowed/forced to move into a place where they could easily be trapped because they are dependent on an elevator that would not be operating in an emergency. Perhaps they moved in while the kid was still little and no one thought of wheelchairs and fires because the parent could easily carry the child out...

I hope at the least this pretty minor issue fixes it before it gets serious for them or someone else.  That is a good point Not for convenience, but as far as code goes, the stairs may be equipped with emergency evacuation chairs.  These would be used in an emergency to get a handicapped person out of danger.

Not viable as an alternative to elevators, but if these are in place the building may be up to code. > Yeah there must be a code violation in that.

By that logic every time there is a power outage it's a code violation. A temporary disabling isn't a code violation. [deleted] They're not trapped the stairs are still available to be used. They just need assistance on getting the person out.  I think the fire Marshall would disagree. The same way they disagree when emergency fire exits are blocked or locked.  How are they morons? They shut down the elevators for emergency repairs that they had absolutely no warning that they would have.  Security guard here. We use special chairs for evacuation of wheelchairbound clients. Unfortunately, they are a bit pricy, but maybe there's some kind of state fund that can help? [removed] The building doesn't have to do any such thing. Presumably they signed a lease for a unit on the 103rd floor.  It's a three year old though, it's entirely possible that the mom moved in there before she had the baby or before they realize the baby would need to be in a wheelchair. Lots of people become disabled later on in life and this isn't really that much different than Someone who lived on the 40th floor had an accident and now needs a wheelchair. The thought does horrify me that someone could be trapped I don't really think there's a good solution to make everyone happy you can't ban someone from living upstairs just because stairs are difficult for them but at the same time the thought of me being paralyzed and not being able to get downstairs in a fire or something is also scary Just think about the number of people in wheelchairs who work in buildings with elevators. My workplace specifies that department heads work with the emergency planners to identify any employees who will have issues with evacuating during a fire. (Typically the method starts with "get to the stairwell and stay put as long as you can"; they try to prioritize evacuation assistance to those people who are known to be stuck.) FYI there are specialized evacuation devices designed to bring wheelchair users down stairs in an emergency. I don't know if the building in OP's friend's situation has one, and it's only something designed to be used in an emergency so it is not an ideal solution for every day use. But they exist! They also usually have call buttons that notify emergency services in case of a fire, for people to use when they can't get down the stairs for one reason or another.  

And the stairs are pretty much guaranteed to be fire rated for some amount of time, while elevators are usually guaranteed to become fire funnels simply due to physics.  It's why elevators are always shut off during fire emergencies. OP is on the 40th floor though. You'd need a whole team to get him back up. Interesting.  Got a pic or a link?   How is the "ride" for the passenger [?] in the chair?  Is like BUMP...BUMP...BUMP..for every step? This is vastly different than a fire exit.  This person probably wouldn’t be allowed to use the elevator if there was a fire due to the smoke and potential to be trapped in the elevator.


They make devices for emergency egress of disabled people on stairs, whether or not the building manager needs to provide one in case of emergencies might be a fire Marshall concern. > I think the fire Marshall would disagree.

Do you think the fire Marshall evacuates every building if the power goes out? Tons of disabled people live in places with elevators, it's not an emergency when the power goes off. Building manager here.  When a wheelchair entrance has to be temporarily closed, we proactively make arrangements to accommodate wheelchair users.  Or at least answer the phone when they call to ask WTF. This is asinine. Don't live in a high rise building if you have a disability? So you're just going to lock them out of basically every major city? You haven't thought this through. > The building is going to have to find the OP a first floor apartment that doesn't need elevators to get out of the building, or the OP is going to need a new place to live.

You must have missed the "or". 

I meant it in the sense that the OP needs a place to live that won't become a death trap in case of fire. >It's a three year old 

???

 edit: Y'all I'm seriously just trying to figure out when we learned the subject is three. Yes, we can. We ban people from living in unsafe places and doing unsafe things all the time as a society. Saying that the mother is allowed to choose to put her disabled child's life in danger because she wants to live on the 40th floor is absolutely absurd. 

Having a safe means of egress is a necessity. Living upstairs (especially in a high rise condo) is not.  https://www.medical-supplies-equipment-company.com/emergency-medical-supplies/product/original-evacuation-evac-stair-chair_31952.html 

They're pretty nifty [deleted] I didn’t say don’t live in a high rise. I said don’t live up stairs. I’ll amend that to say don’t live higher than a couple of floors up. 

As others have pointed out, if they absolutely cannot take the stairs, they are fucked in the event of a “get out of the building or your dead” type of emergency like a fire. 

They clearly are the ones who didn’t think it through when they moved into the 40th floor of a building. 

Oh I also didn’t say they shouldn’t do it if they have a disability. Lots of disabilities would be fine in their situation. Just not the kind that prevents them from taking the stairs  bigots who hold contempt for disabled people rarely think it through They don't have to do that, either.

You and I may think it's a good idea. Doesn't mean they have to.

Depending on age and size of the child (someone was claiming 3, but I don't know if that's correct) this may be more a matter of convenience than anything else. Your comment is extremely, extremely ignorant, and moreover, **illegal.** According to Ontario’s Human’s Rights Code, landlords **cannot** decide to not rent to someone based on a disability. They **cannot** say that the person must only live on the first floor.  You keep writing about “deciding” to live on that floor. Not much info from OP about the family’s income level or housing options in the area, but that apartment might have been the best choice they had.

You can’t make “better choices” when you don’t have them.  And that is absurd, discriminatory and would block anyone with such a disability from living in a major city. It’s an ignorant position that you really haven’t thought about.  I get your point. But it’s easier to say “make a better choice” when you have lots of choices. It’s possible that this apartment was the best or only option. 

Source: Social worker who’s client broke a leg carrying her son’s wheelchair down 2 stories. Only apartment they could get with a Section 8 voucher and they had to stay another 60 days.  Yes how dare I think of their safety. I’m a terrible person and such a bigot.  /s  It's awesome that the human rights code lets parents decide to let their disabled children burn alive because they wanted to live somewhere fancy.  I have absolutely thought about it and it’s not discriminatory. It’s looking out for their damn safety!! 

Honestly people. In what universe is it not okay to say “hey, maybe don’t do that. It might kill you” 

Am I not allowed to tell a blind guy to not walk across a busy highway with no guide when traffic is moving fast?   Of course I can tell him not to do that because doing so might kill him!

It’s not discriminatory to factor in someone’s disability when thinking about their safety. It’s just being practical. 

Edit: oh it’s also not discriminatory because I never said they shouldn’t be allowed to do it. Just that they shouldn’t. Those are two different things.  That’s a good point as well.  I’m so sorry, I didn’t realize that you were so physically weak so that you couldn’t pick up a toddler. 

Every person older than 12 unless physically impaired can carry a small child down stairs.  You keep insisting this is a safety issue, as if in 2018 we haven't figured out ways to help people down a few flights of stairs. We have. Your idea would limit massive amounts of people from living in basically any major city. You're just wrong, and reality and the law both say so. Not 40 flights of stairs. Kids are surprisingly heavy. And the child might have medical fragility that requires braces, oxygen, etc.  40 stories is hardly a few. 

Beyond that I don’t know why you are bringing the law up. I specifically took the time to point out that I am not saying that they shouldn’t be ALLOWED to live there. I’m saying they SHOULDN’T. That’s not a legal issue. 

But fine, how about I phrase it differently. 

If they live in a situation that has risks, they are choosing to accept those risks and the consequences.  Feel better?  I agree but at the same time someone with a child in a wheelchair should have chosen to live on a lower floor
