Medically required companion has to pay for ticket? My friend wants to bring his grandfather to an expo, but he read in the details section of the expo, "Companions for those that require medical assistance will need to purchase their own badges." 

His grandfather is unable to walk and is bound to a wheelchair. When he is out an about, his nurse pushes him in the wheelchair. Is the venue allowed to make him buy a ticket for his nurse when she is required for him to be there? He was concerned this is ADA discrimination, as he would have to pay double to attend, as his nurse is required. Yes they are allowed to charge the nurse for a ticket, she is a separate individual. ---
