Neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp My boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. I’ve done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. My front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn’t very visible from the street. I painted it to match the house as well.

Few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife’s never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which I chalked up to her being shy or whatever. However, recently I got a note taped up to my door that said she’s going to sue if I don’t take the ramp down, as it’s an eyesore and “reduces curbside value.” I have no idea what she means since you can’t see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

She refused to answer the door when I went over to talk to her about it. I’m trying not to lose my temper over this but it’s hard. There’s been many times my boyfriend has been screwed over by so-called “handicap accessible” places, I don’t want my home to be one of them. Does she have any sort of case? I’m in Washington. So she's claiming that your ramp is causing the value of her house to decrease. The ramp was up when she bought the house? Then surely any "decreased value" was already taken into account when she had estimates and made an offer on the house she bought. If everything had permits and is up to code, you have nothing to worry about anyways. Lawyer here. Not your lawyer. Not a Washington lawyer. She has no case.

These sound like the kind of people who will come on your property and fake an injury, likely related to the ramp, to establish grounds for a suit.

My advice would be to serve her and every other person living at that address with a Trespass Notice, served by a Sheriff. You'll want it drafted to encompass agents, employees, servants, etc. so that they cannot send someone to your property. If they violate the notice and enter your property, call the police, have them arrested, press charges. Spend a couple hundred on a lawyer and a few more bucks on Sheriff service.

These are crazy people. Do not try to reason with them. She's got nothing. She gets no say in how you maintain your property beyond her right to vote. The city may have laws concerning structures, she can make a complaint with the city if she so chooses. I doubt they have any legal restrictions on handicap ramps beyond ensuring they are structurally sound. Meh. Firstly, public policy favors handicap accessiblity. This leads to the second point: zoning/HOA rules cannot discriminate against a protected class such as the disabled. 

In the balance between property values and protected classes, the law leans toward the protected class. 

 "No" is a complete sentence. "Piss off, you intruding crone, and stay off my property." is as well.

Lots of people threaten to sue over dumb shit. That's all you have right now. Your neighbor is unlikely to have any cause of action to sue you over a fixture on your property that was present when they moved in. Just a thought - from your posts, it sounds like you may be male? And in a gay relationship? I’m wondering if her issue isn’t with the ramp itself, but just trying to make life difficult for you because she’s a homophobe. [removed] [removed] Based on your answers to other people, including the fact that you have a permit AND she purchased her home after the ramp was built, she has no case whatsoever. (She wouldn't anyway but even still, your ducks are in a row). I hope your partner and you aren't bothered by this busy body again. I'd ignore her and if she does it again, send her a letter advising her harassment needs to end as your permit allows you to build whatever you needed for your home to be accessible. She can piss right off :) GL man! Be aware that the problems are not anything about your ramp- she is using the ramp as a means of bullying you. 

When this fails, she will up the ante and find some other excuse to taunt you. Invest in security cameras, the kind that are not Obvious because you want to catch her in the act, not let her know she can be seen in the act. (mine are camouflaged with fake plants adhered to the cables blah blah) 

I'm serious- people who approach you to "first punch" law suit threaten instead of addressing the issue like a normal person (non-issue) are the type of people with mental problems. She has focused her mental problem on you. 

It will NOT stop with the ramp. 

In fact- threaten to sue HER if she harasses you further on the subject- have a notice delivered to her by sheriff deputy (probably cost you 25 bucks to have him deliver it) 
 Absolutely get a nice "cease and desist".  It won't cost too much and will scare the pants off of the idiot bully. [removed] [removed] If you got the proper permits  and approvals from the city to build the ramp, there is nothing she can do, unless maybe you are part of an HOA. [removed] [removed] IANAL, but can you see an attorney about possibly getting a Cease and Desist Order for harassment? And in that letter also include that:

a) the ramp was there before they purchased the house, so obviously not damaging property values and 

b) the ramp is permitted by the city and   


c) that in order to even see the ramp and know it's there she had to be trespassing in the first place. 

And d) the ramp was built for a disabled client and to demand he now not be given handicap access to his own home is violating \[insert law or local ordinance or other thing that could potentially scare the crap out her\] and can result in a fine of $$$$. 

NOTE: I know those laws only apply to a business NOT providing handicap access, but this is a woman who ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. So chances of her not understanding it doesn't apply to her seem less than likely if it's on legal letterhead.

These are just what I would do if I were in your position. IF I could find an attorney happy to do this for a fair price. 

Also of course "No Trespassing" signs and cameras including a hidden on that directly films the ramp in the event she tries to claim she came over and got hurt. 

I'm sorry you're dealing with this bully.  I would file a police report banning them from trespassing, and put up cameras.  [removed] Pretty much everything has been answered here. Cameras if you can, your permit is enough to not get in trouble if they really want to be mean. If they don't know much about your husband's situation, and you haven't been able to talk to them by knocking on the door, you could place a nicely worded letter explaining the reasoning and that you have a permit for it. Someone already pointed out that the value doesn't matter since they bought the house after you had it installed, so the value would already be taken into account. The key is being nice, being rude or passive aggressive could be enough for them to actually do something if they're those asshole kind of people. Remember, you have to live next to them likely for a while so it won't do any good if you aren't being polite and civil, it might only make things worse and tense in the long run.  [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] The ramp was up when she bought the house. I installed it about a year ago. I guess she could argue that she didn't see it but if she didn't see it for so long wouldn't anyone she'd sell to also not see it? Ugh this is making me so mad. [removed] [removed] Real estate agent here, not Washington, but this applies to all 50 states. Get a copy of the ADA laws. It is explicitly stated that all accessibility improvements are exempt from any HOA or deed restrictions. This right here will stop them in their tracks.  I'd do this, and add a camera system to back it up.  Make sure you get enough cameras that the cameras can observe anyone approaching other cameras so she can't disable them without being recorded, because this seems like the type of person that will lose their mind if they don't get their way. In the end, if she sue's, make sure you hire an attorney to respond.  With the trespass notice in place, her position will be weaker in a judge's eyes.  Add that to the fact that your government permitted wheelchair ramp serves the needs of a bonafide disabled person and the fact that it existed prior to her buying her property, she has no chance.  Based on the facts, you might even be able to get her complaint ruled to be frivilous and get awarded attorney's fees. Get a security camera so she can’t fake an injury  [removed] If her behavior continues would this be considered harassment, and would they be able to recoup mental anguish damages in civil court? NAL, curious for the sake of OP.  [removed] You don't have enough information to make that determination. Community rules are quite common and enforceable. Many require such a ramp to be on the side/rear of the house. 
You do not have unrestricted universal over what happens to your property if say you live in a condo, neighborhood with rules, etc. 
 I got my permits but I was worried that didn't matter in civil court or whatever. It's a very structurally sound ramp. [removed] Especially when it involves reasonable steps to enable a handicap owner access to his residence. Somehow, I do not think a judge would be real happy if this matter were brought before him/her. It freaks of bias against a handicap person. As long as the ramp does not blatantly violate local code, this treat has no legs. However, respond to it in the unlikely event you are served. Yeah, we're gay. Idk this place is pretty liberal so I can't see any of this turning out well for her from a reputation standpoint. *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

*Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment.* Washington state real estate appraiser here. The arguement that the view of the ramp would in any way affect the value of this person's home is laughable.  You would have to find other homes that sold that had similar views of ramps and prove that due to those views the values of each of those homes was affected.  Just not possible.  The real problem here is your neighbor is an ass.  For that I'm sorry.  The only issues you should worry about are the time and expense of getting this person off your back. Just want to clarify that in general no one has a "right" to high property values, or any claim against a neighbor for using their property as they see fit. So even if you did build it after she moved in she still wouldn't have a legitimate case here.

There is a *small* amount of gray area if you built something with the specific intent of harassing/harming her, or if you are in an HOA. But in this case feel free to tell her to pound sand.

If she does actually sue, be sure to respond. [removed] Did you need a permit to build the ramp? If you're not violating any local building regulations then its just her opinion which is worth fuck all legally speaking. [removed] [removed] *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

*Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment.* [removed] [removed] Just wanted to add she can sue. She can sue you for your eye color if she wants.

If she does sue don't ignore it. If you just the permits even if this goes to court it seems the law is on your side. Though if she’s the kind of person to complain about this I doubt it will stop her might wanna look into some home security. 

Side note: if the ramp can’t be seen unless your on the property like you said I get the idea it’s not the ramp she has a problem with but you/your bf. In that case I'd mail her a copy of the permit and kindly tell her to piss off. I'd additionally inform her she is not welcome on your property for any reason, further trespasses will be reported to the police. >I got my permits

That's where the conversation ends. Due diligence, while not impossible to overcome as the complainant, sets the bar somewhere around "they need evil rich people money and lawyers" to even joke about fighting. You have permits and need the ramp.

Let her try to take it to the city, they'll laugh at her.

I would listen to the to post about getting a trespass order though, to let them know they have no ground and can fuck right off, and you're protected in case they do something stupid Send her a letter stating that she needs to build a wheelchair ramp on her home to make it wheelchair accessible and ADA compliant. [removed] [removed] [removed] To be fair, harassing someone over handicap accessibility of their home is not likely to play well for her reputation either.
 [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] If she moved in after the ramp was installed then it can't have lowered her property values anyway. [removed] > Just want to clarify that in general no one has a "right" to high property values, or any claim against a neighbor for using their property as they see fit.

As someone who works for land use services, I can confidently tell you that there are ***many*** laws preventing you from using your property as you see fit. Generally it's stuff preventing safety hazards but there are plenty of laws regarding stuff like blocking eyelines and having your lights too bright and other eyesore related issues. And then there's the obvious stuff like causing noise disturbances and the obscure like capturing rainwater

Code enforcement cites people all the time for having trash and junk and eyesores on their property, even if it's not a safety/health hazard. 

San Bernardino county can have a shipping container to use for storage but they'll deny you a permit if the paint doesn't "match" the surroundings. Also if you want to set down a mobile home and it's older than 10 years you have to get a "compatibility determinations" for basically the same thing, to make sure it's not out of place in the neighborhood.

*Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment.* After posting this I kind of wondered the same thing. There is one question that I had; is this OP’s boyfriends primary residence or is he trying to make HIS home more accessible for his SO? 

I do know that you need to get permits to complete the improvements (if necessary). It sounds like OP did. But, if there is an HOA guideline or a deed restriction, OP may not be protected against such improvements (I know that’s really crappy) under the ADA guidelines. The guide lines specifically state persons home of residence. I think we need to defer to OP for this. 

IF there are no HOA or deed restrictions, and they have the proper permits (OP states that he did) then they are totally in the right and nothing should hinder them. 

Honestly, at this point OP really needs to seek professional legal advice. I will say that u/spoonrise who identified them selfs as a lawyer got it right to begin with.  *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

*Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment.* [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Are you saying that OP could likely get less in an award by claiming, what, harassment due to discrimination? The bar for emotional distress -> money is extremely high. This does not even remotely come close. There are remedies for frivolous lawsuits. OP can sue for whatever OP wants. Doesn’t mean he/she will prevail. Just an FYI- Those permits would be a matter of public record. Which is good for OP because the reason they exist is to create a public covenant, so to speak, as to what someone is legally allowed to do to their home, as well as ensuring that it’s done safely. 

There are also federal fair housing laws that cover this, as physical handicap is a protected class. Check with the US department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), to see what recourse may be available if you continue to be harassed either for your ramp or your sexuality (which is also protected class).

*Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment.* [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Ultimately what I’m saying is; it depends on how the case is tried. I can’t speak for civil law and all I can do for real estate law is quote laws and court decisions. I can’t offer any legal advice out side of contact an attorney. Sorry bud. Wish I could help.  There are certain specific laws that often apply to real estate laws that award treble damages. I don’t actually know if that would qualify here, since the parts I know of in real estate apply directly to violations of the consumer protection act or other unfair business dealings, not civil things that bleed into property values or whatever, but it’s definitely possible that the commenter is correct. 

But as a disabled person I can say that it’s often not worth the cost of litigation for us to fight every last battle for damages. It’s really dependent on your resources and the resources of the people you’re fighting against, as well as the legal protections.

There are laws regarding HOAs or housing facilities, so I imagine those would certainly apply here. It just wouldn’t necessarily get you damages beyond lawyers fees and such.  Yes, but not after the first one and likely not until after the first dozen. Your post was removed because it points to an obfuscated link - a Google search, link shortener, or something similar.
