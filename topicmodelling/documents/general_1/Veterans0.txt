Looking for advice dealing with VA hospital, don't know where else to turn Hey guys, looking for some advice in regards to dealing with an issue I’m having with my local VA hospital. This is going to be a long, dumb story and I am not comfortable attempting to summarize in a TL;DR fashion so I apologize for its non-inclusion and thank you for even attempting to read this idiot’s tale. Additionally, I am recapping these events based on my memory of the events so some things may be out of order. That being said, I can elaborate on any perceived oddness in these specifics and will 100% stand by the overall progression of these events.

Ok, so, over the summer I was studying for a graduate school entrance exam (think LSAT, MCAT, GRE, etc.) and was under a relatively large amount of stress (stress level will become relevant later) because I was also living off of savings so I could focus all of my attention on the aforementioned exam. In late June/early July of this year I was about to run out of my prescribed ADHD medicine and called my mental health clinic on a Thursday to request a refill. They informed me that my MD was not in the office so the Rx could not be refilled. I want to point out that they never even asked what type of medicine I was out of. They just asked who my MD was and then told me he wasn’t there so it couldn’t be refilled. Thank God it wasn’t for something more “serious” than ADHD. I called back again on the next day and got the same response. I resigned myself to running out over the weekend and figured he would be back in on the following Monday. This was not the case. When it became apparent on Monday morning that he would not be in that day either I figured that there was no way this was the SOP and went down to speak to someone in person. I was wrong again. I admittedly made a bit of a scene in the patient advocates office as well as the Chief of Staff’s secretary’s office. I was swearing and just generally pretty angry that I was losing study time to the stupidity that is the VA. 

This is when the stress levels become relevant – in addition to being pretty generally stressed, I was also now in the middle of amphetamine withdrawals. This makes a person easily irritated, causes mood swings, and – of course – exacerbates all symptoms of ADHD such as impulsiveness in social interactions. I am not trying to excuse myself – I was unnecessarily rude to people who didn’t write the rules and it was wrong. I am merely trying to provide some context for my behavior.

Anyhow, the scene I caused didn’t even really work. They offered to connect me with a Lake City VA MD who was willing to write me a prescription on short notice but he said I needed to take a drug test and he did not explain the why of this drug test (again – becomes relevant later). More disclosure – I have been smoking marijuana to manage the side effects of amphetamines that I was experiencing. Namely: loss of appetite, general anxiety produced as the amphetamines wear off, and inability to sleep. I live in a state where only medical is legal and I do not have a “green” card as they call them. I generally don’t trust the VA and have been encouraged by literally every single person I’ve spoken to to be wary of them so this drug test struck me as a trap. I should have listened to those others and myself because, as you will soon see, everyone was right. This self-treatment of the side-effects is seemingly the crux of the issue. I say seemingly because my VA is incapable of effective communication and has ceased all communication with me as of seven weeks and one day ago. 

I ended up having to wait until either Wednesday or Thursday of that week (6 – 7 days since my first call) for my MD to come back into the office. He called me back when he got back into the office and echoed what the Lake City MD said – that I would need to take a drug test to continue being prescribed my medicine. As it turns out, this is a new federal requirement for distribution of amphetamines by the VA. Neither the Lake City MD nor my MD said this nor have they said it to this day. I was told by a third MD that I would not be able to see again. I was still pretty heated that the system just left me hanging unmedicated for ~a week and I let my MD know it. I let him know in unnecessarily colorful terms how I was feeling. I asked him how this system was acceptable based on the recommendation of literally literature on medicating ADHD that the patient take their medication every day consistently. His response was to ask me to stop swearing. I don’t think this is an inherently unreasonable request. However, when the request is being made by a board-certified psychiatrist to a patient going through withdrawals and exhibiting textbook symptoms, I feel it is less reasonable. I let him know as much and requested that I see a new doctor.

The mental health clinic told me that I would not be able to see a new MD for over a month. I was predictably not ok with this and they eventually said that I could attempt to do a “walk-in” with them so I went in the next day and sat my ass in their office until a doc had free time and was willing to see me. He had only been with the VA for less than a week and seemed extremely reasonable. He is one of the people that told me to keep as much information as I could from the VA as I could. Unfortunately, I would not see him again after this. He said that he didn’t understand why I was being treated the way I was and wrote a 30 day Rx for me. I would try to walk-in with him after this Rx ran out but he would refuse to see me again after that first meeting. If nothing else, the VA is very good at circling their wagons.

During the time in between my exam and the semester starting I kept interacting with the VA through the patient advocate and was eventually able to kick up enough dust to get a brief meeting with the Chief of Psychiatry. I fucked up here and confided in him and the patient advocate that I use marijuana to manage the side-effects of amphetamines. I also expressed concern that I was being jerked around on the drug test to which he replied (and I directly quote – I wrote down what he said in my Notes app on my phone during the meeting):

> Taking the drug test will have no effect on your prescription. 

Relieved I agreed to meet with a fourth MD who had been instructed to write my Rx. Unfortunately, I did not pay close enough attention to the wording chosen here and that lack of attention to detail would eventually bite me in the ass. More on that later, though.

In my meeting with the fourth MD, I relayed all of the information of the previous paragraph and he was immediately against writing the Rx due to the marijuana use. I tried to emphasize that the Chief of Psychiatry had said that it should have no effect on my prescription but he was adamant. This was a red flag that I missed. We eventually basically settled on a, “you don’t ever ingest marijuana *wink wink*,” agreement and he distributed another 30 day Rx. He then set me up with a FIFTH MD who I would meet with a few days before that Rx was set to run out.

At this meeting he reiterated the drug test requirement. Finally, five docs in, he said that it is a new federal mandate and there is no way around it. I expressed my confusion about nobody – including the Chief of Psychiatry – sharing this detail. He told me he would write me a two week prescription and then I would have to take a drug test. I reiterated that the Chief of Psychiatry had said that the drug test would have no effect on my prescription and he said that was his prerogative and I would have to take it up with him. He offered me benzo’s, SSRI’s, and anti-anxiety pills to manage the symptoms I was using marijuana to manage which I declined. In addition to doing a lot of personal research on these drugs, I also have personal experience with all of these compounds and do not believe the juice is worth the squeeze. Regardless, I am in the last semester of a rigorous program at a Top 35 university and (forgive the self-back patting) am excelling at an extremely high level. 

Thinking I had the Chief of Psychiatry to fall back on, I accepted the Rx and continued to manage my symptoms in the way I’ve found to be most effective. When the 5th MDs Rx ran out, I contacted him one last time and he maintained his position. The Chief had given me his extension so I said my goodbye’s to MD #5 and called him. This is when I figured out I had gotten got. He said (again I directly quote):

> I said **taking** the drug test would have no effect on your prescription, I never said the **results** would have no effect on your prescription.

At this point I was shocked and didn’t really know what to do. I decided to endure the withdrawals again and try to function without the medication. I gave the withdrawals a week and the experiment a second week. Before these two weeks were up it was already apparent that it was not going to work. While ADHD is absolutely manageable by behavioral modification, I neither know how to perform this modification nor do I think it possible to try and make the full switch on a dime mid-semester. I met with the patient advocate once more to no avail. I tried to use a connection a friend had at the hospital to no avail. Throughout the time these actions took place, I left two messages with the Chief of Psychiatry asking for assistance. He has never replied.

I again failed to maintain my composure while attempting to stage a sit-in at the leadership’s office until someone would talk to me and got into pointless verbal quibbles with the secretary. They had the facilities police officer “remove” me from the premise. I was 100% cooperative and he was actually pretty sympathetic as he escorted me out of the building. I had not been allowed to speak with the leadership because they were all out of town. So I returned two days later and was given a new reason that I wasn’t allowed to speak with the leadership. I managed to catch the Chief of Staff’s secretary on my way out again and basically begged her to ask the Chief of Staff to look into this because my life is falling apart at an increasingly rapid rate (I need to apply for two graduate programs, move, and find a job by January) and she said she would bring it to the Chief of Staff’s attention. *edit* Once I got home, the VA's Major at the police department for the facility called me and tried *extremely* hard to get me to come back in and talk to him. I saw no benefit that could come from this and just don't really trust the police in general so I refused and told him I had to go to class so I had to hang up. He told me that he would call me after class and I started to protest and then realized it wasn't worth it and just said, "Sure, talk to you later," and then blocked his number.

On my way home, a lawyer specializing in veteran’s issues returned my call and told me that, while he could not personally assist me in this matter, he could refer me to someone in the county government that could assist me. I spoke with her and sent her a letter that I had also hand delivered to the secretaries of my hospital’s leadership. This was last week and, of course, she has not followed up despite saying she would confirm receipt of the letter.

Whew, ok, so that brings us today. If you’ve made it this far you’re a better person than I am; although that is probably already apparent. Before I shut up, I want to take a second to address a few things:

Firstly, I know that I fucked this up pretty much from the start and should have just put the ganja down. That has now been done and I haven’t smoked in ~1.5 months. Hindsight is 20/20 but, for perspective, I have also been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. This basically means I’m a neurotic fuck who is always anxious so when I found a way to both be successful in pursuing my ambitions AND manage my anxiety I really, really didn’t want to let it go. I recognize that was a huge, huge mistake amongst many others and am not trying to defend it. I am just trying to be as honest and forthcoming as possible to paint the truest picture.

Additionally, I am not trying to argue that an exception somehow magically be made to federal law for me. This has been going on for four months and if I had just been told at the start:

> It is a new federal mandate that you must be drug tested to be prescribed amphetamines. Additionally, if you test positive for illegal substances, we cannot - by this same law - distribute the medication for any reason

I am confident it could have all been resolved almost immediately. Instead, this information was slowly distributed over the course of months and caused escalation of the conflict (justified or otherwise). 

Ok that’s it. I am posting here because nobody will talk to me and my life is starting to circle the drain faster and faster. I feel helpless and, while I am trying as hard as I can to stay motivated and positive, I can feel myself slipping into a depressed state. I can’t afford going the private route because I am uninsured outside of my VA coverage. The practice I spoke to quoted me $300 for an INITIAL VISIT so, yeah, that’s not viable. If anyone has any suggestions on how I can go about rectifying this situation I am all ears. All I want to do is put this behind me, medicate my mental health disorder, and continue pursuing my dreams with the vigor and focus I know is possible. Thank you for reading if you made it all the way through this.
 First... top 35 university and you feel your life is slipping away. It isn't.  So, you have to come off some medications go on Buspar. It is not habit forming and it is great for neurotic fucks. Frankly, this could be very good for you.

Second start using mindfulness. The VA has mindfulness classes and groups and specialists that can train you in it. Request it.

You are excelling at a top 35 university. Your life isn't slipping away. Like here's some perspective from this last week of my life: thursday tore my urethra bleed for many hours; friday drank a six pack and spoke to my doctor about my PTSD; saturday transferred from my wheelchair to the toilet at Sam's club and the transfer bar came out of the wall I busted my finger exploding the tendon in my dominant hand and hurt my right shoulder (I am in a wheelchair my hands and shoulders are my leg) got home had a fight with my wife got drunk and went out got picked up by police because my wheelchair was stuck in a pothole and the shit keeps going down. 

You're good. If you're in crisis use the crisis line. There is no benefit in fighting VA officials on federally mandated laws. Yes they could have handled it better. First off, I echo u/Schnauzer, in that if you are in a crisis, call the Crisis Line.

Next, contact that VA cop Major, and arrange for a meet. He was probably trying to help you, either so you wouldn't get in further trouble with the cops, or to arrange how to get you a police escort, so you can continue trying to get help through the VA.

Do a walk-in at medical, and \*request\* another drug test. If you have been clean for several weeks as you say, it will at least give you a /chance/ to get started on your treatment regimen again.

If you signed a 'pain contract', you may have to start the entire process of getting medication over again. In it, you stated that you wouldn't use other drugs to control pain, and if you did, they had hte right to stop your medication for opiates and amphetamines.

&#x200B;

Whatever you do, try to stay calm. Whether you believe it or not, they are usually trying to help you. If only to keep you out of their office every single day...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B; I want to first thank you for the recommendation of Buspar. I haven't heard of it and will do my research and see what comes up.

However, I would much rather attempt to manage my anxiety without medication than attempt to manage my ADHD without medication. I understand the general view of ADHD is that I can just "try harder" and it will sort itself out but this view is not one that is supported by objective fact. Whether you believe ADHD exists or not (not making an assumption about which camp you fall in - speaking generally), it is objective fact that taking amphetamines as a child - like I did - permanently depresses levels of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (better known as GABA) in your brain. GABA functionally "calms" your mind and helps lower impulsivity. It connects actions of "now" with the consequences of "later." I'm not even convinced ADHD is real but I am convinced that the attempted treatment of it - real or not - permanently altered my neurochemistry.

I appreciate what you are doing by trying to bring perspective to this and I truly am sorry for what you have been through and are continuing to go through. I wish there was some way I could help.

That being said - the goals I'm trying to accomplish are ones that I need to be able to focus on. I understand that to you it may seem to be trivial but these goals are everything to me. For the first time in my life I can say without question that I know what I want to do with my life because it calls to me every single second of every single day. I know I will not be able to live with myself longterm if I fail.

I am not trying to fight the VA on federally mandated laws and I feel as if I was pretty clear about that. I have felt that way throughout this entire process, however, so obviously I am failing to communicate something properly. I never felt like I was fighting them based on the information I was given and, now that I have the actual information, I've taken it to heart and made the changes that they asked me to make to continue my prescription. Unfortunately, they have shutdown all lanes of communication so now I am just stuck. That is the heart of the problem as it stands, in my opinion. I appreciate the concern but you don't have to worry. This too shall pass, of that I am certain.

I'll spare you the details but I had a pretty horrific night at the hands of the police my first year out and I cannot trust myself to maintain my composure. A meeting with the police is just not something I trust myself to navigate correctly.

It's funny you have brought that link to my attention when you did. I actually just found it myself about 5 hours ago. My mind is still a bit blown and I don't know what to do with the information. I did not sign a pain contract. Am I missing something or does it prove that they've been lying to me this entire time? I read the whole Directive that is linked at the bottom of the page and it mentions nowhere that a positive test for marijuana means I cannot be prescribed amphetamines. In fact, the small amount of Googling I've been able to do indicates that that is just flat out not true anywhere for anyone.

I'm currently planning on going to the county office and trying to follow up with the Veterans Services people in person. The popular opinion amongst those I've spoken to is that they may not be ghosting me but just don't see updating me on their progress as a priority. Additionally, I've heard they have something called a "VA Rep" that is essentially someone that acts as a mediator and goes and talks to the VA for me on my behalf. Fingers crossed and all but I know better than to get my hopes up at this point. I've lost what little faith I had in the system before this debacle.

Thank you for your response, I appreciate you taking the time to read it and make recommendations. I agree. ADHD is difficult and it is quite real. The impact of drugs does permanently alter your mind. 

The reality is simply this is you now. Thus the reality of facing it. I understand it isn't necessarily fair. I understand you were misled. Just keep trying, try to keep perspective, work on what you can. 

As for fighting the VA and communication being shutdown that's normal. Hell, I know guys that never were on drugs get drug seeking flags in their file. The VA also can flag you for safety, which means anytime you come onto a VA campus you would have to be escorted by the police.

Take care of yourself. I understand it is difficult. I don't think there are many ways to open the lines of communication again, because I imagine you're flagged as a drug-seeker.  If you think you can't handle a face to face with the cop, text him. After all, he called you first. Explain what you just said to me to him, and ask him if you can communicate via text or email, or if he could send you a letter.

The point being, YOU are answering him, and nit ignoring him.  Be polite, and perhaps  try to state the problem as a result of your not getting the meds you need.

&#x200B;

The VA changed their 'Official' policy last year (I believe), to the one stated on their website now. Many of their providers (and supervisors) don't know the rules changed. They are trying to operate under the old rules (which included the contracts), so have the policy printed out and carry it with you.

A Veterans Rep might be able to help you. 

If you don't get a good response from them, you can always try asking a lawyer (a lot of them will do simple discussion with you pro bono (free). That would be your next logical step, although that might (unlikely) lead to police involvement for illegal drug use. Damn.. I didn't know it but this is the absolute last thing I wanted to hear. It's hard to hear but I really do appreciate you saying it. It is never easy being the guy who distributes hard truths. I guess I'm just kind of embarrassed by my naivety. The VA is what I've been told by dozens it is but.. I don't know. I guess it's just the difference between understanding something and knowing something. 

It's frustrating because I upheld my end of the deal. I did my duty, I deployed 3 times in 4 years, and I left with an honorable discharge. But they can just stop talking to me and walk away from our agreement? I fight, they help me cope.. That was the deal, right? I'm sure you can relate to the fact that more than anything I just feel betrayed right now.

Such is life, eh? I'll persevere and find my way. You are absolutely right. It's just time to start looking for new tools to help me keep climbing. Thank you for saying what I think those close to me didn't know how to, friend. I hope your burdens lighten and - if they don't - I believe you can bear them. Good luck.
