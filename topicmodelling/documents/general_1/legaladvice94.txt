[WA] My estranged sister is trying to bully her way into becoming my caretaker. How do I get her to back off? I [25/M] suffer from a few illnesses that have rendered me physically disabled, but I am mentally sharp and sound. My family was highly emotionally toxic and infantilized me severely as well as disapproved of my homosexuality, so I cut contact with them when I was 20. I married my partner [30/M] two years ago, but he’s been my next-of-kin/power of attorney/etc. for three years. I have a lovely, professional caregiver who comes in and helps me with various household tasks.

My sister [27] recently contacted me to apologize for her behavior and I was cautiously optimistic about us having a relationship again, but it quickly became apparent she wants me to come back under the thumb of our toxic family. The last straw was when she said I was being isolated and abused by my husband, my medications and treatments are shams because I’m not “cured” yet, and that she was going to go to court to become my guardian and take control of me. I immediately cut contact but have received several threatening letters.

I’m not being abused or isolated by anyone, even if I’m frequently bedbound and I use a wheelchair. I don’t think she could get guardianship of me, since I am mentally sound and married, but is there even a possibility of her case getting to court? What can I do to head her off before she tries to file anything? To be clear - you're legally married, have a marriage certificate, etc. Correct?

To head it off send a certified "leave me the hell alone and don't contact me again" letter. It doesn't need to be long and frankly, a <1 page letter does the trick. Keep copies. If she keeps bothering you, file for a restraining order and file a police report for harassment. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent crazy from being crazy. If she tries to file for guardianship, you get a lawyer and fight it back. As long as you are competent to manage your own affairs, she will only be wasting her time and money. 

You can, however, estrange yourself from her again. If someone in my were to accuse my husband of isolating me (which is absurd on the surface as my family likes him better than they like me, but still) - I would have nothing to do with them until an apology came, and probably not even then. You do not have to put up with family members who act contrary to your happiness.   NAL, but a nurse. 

It is surprisingly hard to get guardianship of an adult, it took my mom over 6 months of court dates to obtain guardianship of her mother (my grandmother) who had been diagnosed with dementia years before, was regularly confused, and clearly could no longer live on her own. (Couldn’t walk, house filthy, multiple falls with fractures, etc.) And this is someone for whom adult guardianship was basically meant for. 

You are not confused, you are of sound mind. It’s going to cost her a LOT of money to not win. 

Save all the letters she sends you, send off that “leave me the hell alone” letter via registered mail (so she has to sign for it, proof for you that she received it) and ignore it until you receive actual legal paperwork regarding this. Don’t engage with her outside of written communication. 

If you wanted, you could inform your doctor (your primary would work, basically anyone who you see for medical care with an MD/DO/NP/DNP in their name) that your sister is trying to force adult guardianship on you, and ask if they would be a witness for you should this go to court. A medical professional who is familiar with your disability and needs, and can confirm that you are functioning, of sound mind, and tend to your medical needs will go a long way. I suspect you probably have at least one specialist as well- it doesn’t hurt to rack up a list of medical professionals who will confirm that you are not in need of guardianship. 

I’d also make an appointment to double check your POA/living will/advance directives paperwork too, make sure it’s all locked in and there are no loopholes. 

If she keeps sending letters (not legal ones) after the cease and desist, you would have a case for harassment and possibly a no contact/restraining order. 

Edit: I’d also look into lawyers, maybe not sit down with one but have an idea of who you plan to call when/if this happens.  She can piss away time and money trying to get guardianship of a mentally sound person in a healthy supportive household. She’ll lose. Badly.  The fact that you have both appropriate medical care and a comprehensive personal support plan with your partner will do a lot to head this off. As others have suggested, write her back with a polite "get out of my life" note, and break contact.

If she does sue for guardianship, have an attorney handle it. Guardianship is such a severe imposition on your rights that you would normally have a guardian ad litem assigned, but bringing your own attorney to the table would be a very good idea. There's no need to get ahead of this, though: you can worry about it if and when she files. Getting guardianship is an expensive and difficult process especially in WA and even more difficult if the person rejects guardianship. 

All that being said there are lawyers out there who will take money from people not caring that the client has no legal grounds. And if your family lies to them about your condition? Yeah...some lawyer might could take up the case.

I'd consider a psych eval if you want to get ahead of it. She'd have to prove incapacitation by a mental health professional.  Judges don't like dueling reports.  if you have threatening letters, get a restraining order - this will also make it more difficult for her to establish guardianship over you. Any judge that this came before should laugh this straight out of court (and hopefully, with prejudice) Can’t believe I didn’t think of this before—every state has a protection & advocacy agency that protects the civil rights of individuals with mental and physical disabilities. They provide general legal advice and referrals to appropriate attorneys. (Cases they litigate themselves are generally large class action suits against states and institutions.) So that’s another good (and free) resource for you if you’d feel better talking to someone.

But, from what you’ve written here, it sounds as though no judge who spoke with you and reviewed your records would give your sister the time of day.  If you do want to talk to an attorney and aren’t sure where to start, look for an attorney who does special needs planning and/or elder law. They’ll be intimately familiar with guardianships. 

Best to you! I’m glad this thread has made you feel better.  This isn't legal advice, but I would recommend seeing a therapist/counselor at some point. Not just because they could back you up as a mental health professional, but because therapy might be helpful for you if you're feeling stressed because of external situations (health, family, etc) and therapists generally have... a *lot* of experienced with weird families and helping patients deal with shit-stirrers.  Tell her to fuck off.  Everyone has a smart phone now, make a video together and clear statements about what you both want and what you don't want.

Make more than one video and add them to your collection so if it is ever contested you will have solid and indisputable proof. [removed] [removed] Yes, and I have previous paperwork from before we were married making him my next-of-kin and power of attorney when I'm incapacitated. My biggest worry is her dragging her conservative church into all of this as they have much deeper pockets for attorneys, but any attorney would tell her she has no case right?

I'm no longer talking to her or anyone in my family. This thread has soothed my fears of having my life taken over. I guess now my biggest fear is her making my life hell with frivolous lawsuits and APS... I'm confident in her losing, I'm just concerned about her being a pain in my ass before she does.

*Do not reply to this message as a comment.* Yep, you can reissue POA paperwork (and need to ensure that it's a durable power of attorney) if you'd like to double down on it. You should also have a living will and reasonable estate plan. Just so you know, you don't need an attorney for the "fuck off" note. Just send her a text, a certified letter, and/or an email so that there is proof that she was told to fuck off in clear terms. Then get an attorney if you need to file a restraining order. I want to double down on the idea of a restraining order. After telling her not to contact you, please try for one if she ignores your wishes. This would be great documentation to show a judge if she ever did take you to court for guardianship. Also, gather together any proof of the family's toxicity and keep it handy, just in case. An ethical attorney would tell her she has an extremely weak case if she accurately relayed the situation from a neutral perspective. I would hope any attorney would tell her she has no way of willing conservatorship over someone of sound mind who is married and capable of managing their life unassisted. But here's the catch - people lie to us all the damned time. If she tells a lawyer that you are not mentally sound, it is possible one would be willing to take the case, but hopefully would advise her to drop the case once discovered you are. 

I almost asked, but I assume the reason she wants guardianship is because you get SSI or SSDI and wants the money? 

I can not speak for what a Christian church might or might not do. I suppose if she were a regular active member and the church has money, they might consider assisting her with legal bills. I find it unlikely, but I find I am never actually surprised by what a church might do. (For the record, I am not anti-religion. I just mean I am cognizant churches of all types and colors do unexpected things.) 

Just keep on doing you until/if she files for guardianship. If she calls Adult Protective Services, they will pay you a visit to ensure your spouse is not doing what she accuses him of. You do not legally *have* to allow them to interview you without a court order, but to be truthful, it is probably easier if you do. Again, if she does file, hire a lawyer immediately. In the meantime, if she keeps trying to communicate, send her a letter saying in no uncertain terms you want her to leave you alone and keep a copy just in case you need to show the court she had been harassing you and filing was just a nuisance suit.  Even with friends and relatives of hers willing to foot her lawyer, she has absolutely **no** rights to your care or SSI money. 

I mention the SSI angle, as it's what I expect her motivation is. She is very likely in a financial bind, and thinks that if she can prove you're incapable of living on your own, that she can force you to live with her and get access to your disability checks.

Abusive family members don't reconnect out of concern for the person they estranged by their actions. She either wants someone to control and order around, or she wants (what she believes to be) those "big fat disability checks." In her eyes you're just getting paid to exist and "it's unfair!"

Alert your SSI caseworker that she is trying to get guardianship of you against your wishes. Ensure that she cannot access any bank accounts or personal information by requesting a verbal password be placed on your accounts with your bank, credit cards, etc.

Send a certified, return receipt "stay the fuck away from me and never contact me again" letter, and don't initiate any further contact.

Document everything up to this point in a *composition notebook.* Any attempts at contacting you, phone calls, IM's on social media, etc. should be written as soon as possible after the incident to ensure accuracy.

The composition notebook should NOT be used for any other purpose, and do **not** use it to write any other unrelated notes or tear out any pages. This is for your records, so you can show the pattern of harassment/ verbal abuse to the police or a lawyer, if she actually does try anything legally.

Last, if she would go as far as calls to the police for wellness checks, use all of your evidence to obtain a restraining order. You can also call the non-emergency number for the police for more information on obtaining an RO. The court is supposed to appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) once a petition to establish incapacity and guardianship is filed. The GAL is tasked with looking into the need for the requested guardianship, which will include obtaining medical/psychological evaluations and records and talking to you. The GAL then formulates a recommendation that is put into a report that is filed with the court and provided to all interested parties prior to a hearing to establish if the person at issue in the petition (you) is incapacitated. The court cannot issue the guardianship unless they make a finding of your incapacity, and in my experience, the GAL’s word is given more weight than much of what your sister or her attorney would or could say. The GAL is not picked by you or whoever is petitioning for guardianship; she/he/they are assigned by the court, so you don’t have to worry about neutrality, and while I do not know how fees are usually split in Washington, there is a (rather good, in my opinion) chance your sister will be responsible to pay the GAL fees if she files a petition, so those “deep pockets” are not much of a worry, either. You are of course more than welcome to hire your own attorney, or if you can’t afford it, the court can appoint one to you, but with what you have described, I don’t know if that is necessary, at least until you have spoken with the GAL and seen the report. >Conservative church

That might be you main issue.  The “hate-the-sin-not-the-sinner” mantra means she wants you away from your husband because then you will be away from all that gay sin.  She thinks she is doing God’s work. the only thing I haven't seen mentioned is to send the "don't contact me by any method - in person, written, verbal, or electronic" with a return receipt request, signature required, so you can verify she got it. Is there any way she could know or find out who your docs and caregivers are? If so, make sure your records with them are on lockdown - only you and Spouse can do *anything*. Sure HIPAA should protect you, but unhinged malice can be very crafty. And screwups happen, even without malice. Hi there,  I used to work in APS and I wouldn't be too worried. If the information your sister is able to provide them is even enough to trigger an investigation,  you can expect them to come visit, see you are of sound mind, and basically leave after a conversation.  Most of my investigations were basically because family members disapproved of the way a person lived their life. so I'd basically show up, ask some questions to determine if the person makes sense, and go back to the office. If there was a question of mental soundness (competence) we would convince them to see their doctor to have them do a test.  But we couldn't force them. You could pre-empt any possible question by having your doctor do a test with you and provide you the results.  Unfortunately there isn't a ton you can do for that. 

Fortunately unless she just...lies a LOT, and has money to throw in a fire, I would be doubtful of an attorney assisting her with this matter.  You may want to consider a restraining order.

That would be paperwork to use as evidence against her should she follow through with her threats. There is a certain joy in rolling into court and watching my family's faces as the judge realizes I'm perfectly sound of mind.

I'm not exactly receiving a ton of money, either. I guess we look wealthy to her but it's mostly my husband's, so if she tries to take over my life for my money she's in for a rude awakening. I think it's a punishment for leaving the family and living my own life. >I mention the SSI angle, as it's what I expect her motivation is. She is very likely in a financial bind, and thinks that if she can prove you're incapable of living on your own, that she can force you to live with her and get access to your disability checks.

Ooo. Since mom and dad probably have his SSN, and they might give it to her if she asks for it, it also might be a good idea to freeze his credit and password protect any medical information she might try to get from his health care provider(s).  Along these lines, /u/nosistercaretaker might see about instituting a password system WRT medical records, in that they're only allowed to talk to people with the password. That on top of HIPAA controls should lock things down pretty well. If you have any assets you think they might try to go after, consider putting them in a living trust with your husband as beneficiary, rather than write a will. Wills can be contested while in probate. Living trusts cannot, especially if any of your liquid cash is in a joint account with your husband.
