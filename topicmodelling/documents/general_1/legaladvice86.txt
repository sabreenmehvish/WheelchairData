Medical Equipment - wheelchair Hello,

My dad is elderly and his health is declining quickly.  He has no money at all but he has insurance.    He was emitted into the hospital and when he left the hospital, the hospital had him in a wheelchair because he cannot walk now.  I did not think to ask about the wheelchair and I assumed that is was part of the hospital bill.  However,  I found out a year later that the wheelchair was a rental which my dad's insurance pays $30 a month and the wheelchair company was billing my dad but the bill has been going to the wrong address.  Currently the wheelchair company says my dad owes over $520 for the wheelchair.  Once I found out I called the Medical Equipment company to resolve the issue and they will not work with me.  I have not returned the wheelchair yet because they told me even if I returned the wheelchair they will keep sending bills until the full amount is paid.  The company is Carolina's Home Medical Equip.  Charlotte, NC is my location.  What options do I have to resolve this with out paying out of my own pocket? Did you agree to be responsible for your Dad's medical bills?  Were they sending the bill to the address provided at time of intake?  Did you make an offer to them of what you would be willing to pay? I did not agree to be responsible for my dad's bills.  I am not sure if they were sending the bill to the address on the intake form since my sister was the one that took him into the hospital.  I told them would return the wheelchair but I am not going to pay my dad's bills because he does not have any money.  I told them that I would return the wheelchair if they avoid the bill and they said no. You can return the wheelchair to avoid future debts but that won't clear the prior balance. Your sister may have signed something agreeing to be responsible.  It doesn't sound like this is your debt. Have you talked to his insurance company?
