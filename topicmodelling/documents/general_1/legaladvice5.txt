[Ontario] Employer fining employees for using wheelchair accessible stall Throwaway as I do not want any identifying information associated with this post.

I work in an office of approximately 40 people (\~50% female). If relevant, the office is a semi start-up and run by a close-knit group of friends who are all in there 20s and 30s.

Recently a new hire came into the office that is physically disabled and uses a wheel chair. Based of her behaviour toward the CEO (who sits in the office with us) she seems to be a part of the close-knit friend group that runs the office. For the first couple weeks there were no issues, she seemed like any other new hire and our office has all the needed accessibility.

Yesterday a notice was sent out to all the female employees (same gender as the disable employee) that there has been an issue with the wheelchair accessible bathroom stall being occupied by non-disabled parties. The notice detailed a new fining system that will be in place. Any employee (aside from disabled one) using the wheelchair accessible stall will be subject to a $50 fine. The fine is only payable by cash and if not paid, will be considered insubordination. Then it says that after that “repeated infractions could lead to termination”.

This immediately seemed ridiculous to me and illegal. Even worse is that they intend to fine people based of a random stall checks. So they are sending a female employee (also apart of this friend group) to randomly check the women’s washroom throughout the day. If someone is in this stall that she will wait outside of it and when you come out, she issues you the fine. Since the notice was sent out (two days ago) only one of my coworkers has been fined. She called it a humiliating experience and now wants to quit. There are only two stalls in the washroom, one being the wheelchair accessible one, and 15 women. If you really must go and the other one is occupied I think most people wouldn’t hesitate to use the one available.

My question is: Can they legally do this? The HR manager is the one who sent out the notice but he doesn’t strike me as particularly competent.

I feel like this is creating a toxic work environment as many employees now heavily resent the new hire.  I'm not super conversant with Canadian law, but I see a few issues here.  The first is that building code requires a certain number of bathrooms and stalls for a given number of workers.  If this is a small office then essentially eliminating a stall from general use may drop the number below the minimum required.  I would also be curious to know if they same limitation has been applied to the male bathrooms, or if this is a specific accommodation.

What I am sure of is that the employer cannot fine employees without their permission and consent.  When faced with such a "fine" you can simply say no and refuse to pay it.  This might have employment consequences as you mentioned (although the rules are much tougher in Ontario CA than they are in the U.S.) but employer cannot force you to pay.  I would also very much doubt you could be fired in Ontario simply for refusing to pay said fines... might be time to talk to the [Labor Board](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-labour). HC-accessible doesn't mean reserved for HC only. It's not a parking space near the entrance. You don't need a HC placard to use HC toilet.  How do they know that you're not in need of the wheelchair accessible stall? There have been multiple times in my life that I've genuinely needed to use one, even though I do not use a wheelchair, such as after a serious hospitalization when I was cleared for work but still experiencing dizziness between sitting and standing. I used the wheelchair-accessible stall because it had bars to hold should I need them. Your employer has no way of knowing if you need to use this stall, and legally (at least in the US) cannot ask if you have a disability, I believe?  I would talk to the Ontario Human Rights Commission about this. They can't give legal advice, but their reaction will be a good indicator of whether you should speak to an attorney as well. That the fine is assessed only to women, and only on the basis of using the "wrong" bathroom without any actual impact on anyone this system ostensibly is supposed to help support, makes me suspect they'll have Words about this. You should also recommend that your coworker talk to them and to the Ministry of Labour if her employer tries to touch her pay over this fine, or terminates her for refusing to pay it. (Lord help them if they unwittingly fine someone who is using the disabled bathroom for reasons related to an actual disability.)

Being fired for refusing to pay this "fine" should also leave her eligible for her pay in lieu of notice - this is not "insubordination" in any sense the province will recognize as just cause to withhold pay in lieu. She should also be eligible for EI while she looks for other work and/or takes legal action against her employer, although if her RoE claims she was fired for insubordination then the process may be a little more complex than it should be. [deleted] I'd look for a new job, because this one is a shitshow. [removed] IANAL first off...

But if i'm getting this straight:

They have only Male and Female washrooms... with accessible stalls and want to charge a fine *IN CASH*, without any form of adjudication, for using the accessible stalls *ONLY to women* who do not have a *VISIBLE disability*?

Oh yes, sounds very fishy and against parts of the Human Rights Act to me. 

From personal experience with dealing with washroom requirements in Ontario now, they are barking up a dangerous tree with this. And let them hope no one they employ identifies as Trans... It's a wheelchair accessible stall. It is not the same as a handicapped parking spot. Its not illegsl to use those bathrooms or stalls and it definitely seems illegal to fine those that do at work.  Handicap *accessible* is not the same as handicap *mandatory for use.*  Your manager is a dipshit.

Keep shoes similar to those worn by someone you don't like in your office, and slip them on when you're dropping a deuce in the wonderfully spacious handicap stall. Not speaking about legalities, but I’ve seen many businesses have just one large bathroom for use, and it’s just called a handicap bathroom. So there is absolutely nothing that should prevent you from using a handicap or a regular bathroom.

## Toilet Rooms

* **9.12** **(1)** Where it is reasonably practicable, a toilet room shall be provided for employees and, subject to section 9.13, where persons of both sexes are employed at the same work place, a separate toilet room shall be provided for employees of each sex.
* **(2)** Subject to subsections (3) and (4), where a toilet room is provided in accordance with subsection (1), the employer shall provide in that room a number of toilets **determined according to the maximum number of employees of each sex** who are normally employed by him at any one time at the same work place as follows:
   * **(a)** where the number of such employees does not exceed nine, one toilet;
   * **(b) where the number of such employees exceeds nine but does not exceed 24, two toilets;**
   * **(c)** where the number of such employees exceeds 24 but does not exceed 49, three toilets;
* ETA:

**(3)** Subject to subsection (4), where the class of employment in a work place is the transaction of business or the rendering of professional or personal services, the number of toilets provided by the employer in accordance with subsection (2) may be reduced

* **(a)** where the number of employees of each sex does not exceed 25, to one toilet; Seems like this problem will take care of itself without legal intervention. 15 or 20 people using one toilet? That’s going to cause a long line for the potty, no? Seems like once your boss sees everyone lined up by the toilets for extended periods of time, diminishing productivity could cause a reversal in this policy. Don’t pee at your desk. That could compromise your employment in some form, including putting your job at risk. How does your boss plan on enforcing this? If there are cameras in the bathroom that may open up privacy questions

Buildings/businesses have to have disabled washrooms but they dont get punish people who dont have disabilities for using them. 

 Onterio requires 2 toilets for 16-35 people, so if there are 16 other women the company would be required to have another toilet available if the handicapped stall is off limits. It's an accommodation not a reservation
 I wish more people understood that.  Equality is the handicapped person waiting in line to use the loo just as long as everyone else (but still having a loo they can use)   It is an accommodation not a reservation.  Question, if I go to a place and they have a HC toilet but it says "for use only by HC people", is that incorrect / against policy / arguable or what? You can't tell I'm disabled from the outside--even had a cop tell me I don't look disabled--when he complained I was in an HP spot. I have an HP placard. People are stupid. Even though I don't use a wheelchair I need those railings to get up. I've had a stroke. Many HC toilets are higher. My knee doesn't bend well on standing so I use those stalls.  I think you might be expecting far too much from common sense. They are only checking the stalls, not the actual contents of the bowl. Don’t ever give “malicious compliance” advice in here again. Comment removed.  Not if the fine enforcer are standing right outside handicapped stall. They will see who comes out and know who the person was.
 And even if the stalls were for disabled use only, can the business be the one to issue the fine? If I illegally park in the disabled spot at the supermarket, the store isn't the one who collects the fine. I love the way you two think. Good information... thanks! Technically there only needs to be 15 other women Many disabilities impact the ability to hold bowels or bladder effectively. Many other disabilities significantly increase the amount of time it takes a person to get into a stall and situated on a toilet. This leaves many disabled people at an increased risk of accidents if people are thoughtless about their use of disabled stalls.

Correct etiquette is to never use the disabled stall if a regular stall is available. If there’s a line and an obviously disabled person joins the line, you ought to let them have the disabled stall as soon as it opens up. Use it if you want. What are they going to do? oh my god youre right, i hadn't even realized they were taller! i was wondering why my knee has been aching when i use public toilets but not in the hc stalls. i just chalked it up to the bars helping me get up easier, but thinking back on them it probably did have to do with my knee not being forced to bend too far! wild how i can use them for a full year now and not even realize why it was necessary  Why? Not to mention that there won’t be any wheelchair wheels visible underneath the partitions… I thought you said you did park in the disabled spot, but then I reread your comment, thankfully. People who illegally park in those spaces are assholes.  As the lots are private property the security company or tow company generally issue them on behalf of the owners.  Equality is that if everyone has to wait on a stall, EVERYONE has to wait on a stall.  Everyone seems to have their own standard for etiquette here. So as someone with a disability that actually does impact my ability to hold my bowels am I also in the group that gets skipped over because someone missing a leg shows up?

If the disability creates a time urgency, they can skip the line (usually that won't be someone who also has a physical disability requiring the handicapped stall).

But if it's purely a physical access thing, they can wait.  When they are within the last 2-3 people I'd probably let them skip ahead if the handicap steal was the one that opened up.  But not 10 people.
 Not sure why you’re getting downvoted so much, but you are absolutely right. I know from experience through one of my family members. They don’t mind waiting, but many times it just isn’t possible to wait because of their disability. 

I think especially your last paragraph accommodates everyone. 

Just be nice, people. Equality is also letting someone cut the line who’d otherwise soil themselves. Because forcing them through this embarrassment in the name of equality is cruel, and no equality or fairness at all.  True that.  I can’t believe I have to explain this. Because the shit you suggested could compromise OP’s employment in some form, including putting their job at risk. You have no business advising someone to do something that could cause problems at their job. That’s ridiculous, and if you don’t understand that you should not be commenting in this sub at all.  But fairness and equality are distinct concepts, and in the case of disability concerns, what is equal is often not fair. 

Also, in the situation you describe, a disabled person who’s incapable of using a regular stall will frequently have to wait significantly longer than anyone else in the line. The able people can take whichever stall is the next to open up, but the disabled person has to wait for one specific stall to become available. It’s likely that when they reach the front of the line the next few stalls to become available will be stalls that they cannot use.
 Equality is that if everyone has to take the stairs, EVERYONE has to take the stairs.

See how that falls apart? I’ve worked with people who have invisible disabilities that impact their ability to control their bowels, but I’ve also worked with people who had spinal cord injuries that both affected bowel/bladder control and the use of their legs. I won’t guess as to the frequency of continence issues among wheelchair users, but I suspect it’s higher than you think. [removed] Fair is a subjective term, Equal is an objective one.  Fairness cannot be measured, but equality can.  Having worked with several wheelchair bound people in my life, I can say that every one I have ever known only wants to get treated "the same as everyone else."  Not a single one has ever wanted to be treated better or differently.  

If there's a 30 minute line for the ladies and you want to let someone on crutches cut in line, i'd check and make sure it is OK with someone else in that line too.   Equality is if everybody has to reach the second floor, everybody has the ability to reach the second floor. It would be polite to allow people unable to use the stairs to use the elevator first, but if there's a line, there's a line.  That's bad logic.  Everyone is capable of using a restroom and accommodations are being made for those who have a rough time of it.  There's no law or statute saying that those restrooms are used solely for handicapped folks.  If there's a half hour line, what sense does it make that someone gets to jump the line?  That's disney-land logic there, and that's NEVER been abused before.   I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but if I'm near the front of the line in going to be pissed if someone (especially if they aren't obviously impaired) goes ahead of me for a non-time sensitive issue.  If they really have to go, they can say something to that effect (I have a couple times has to disclose Crohn's to get ahead).  But I'm damn sure not assuming they have a digestive issue because they are in a wheelchair (let alone that the digestive issue is manifesting itself to require urgent access).   I personally have all the above depending on the day.  All the problems are solved by communicating and common courtesy.   
1. If you don't need the handicap stall and another is open,  use the open one.   
2. If only the handicap stall is open,  and there isn't anyone obviously disabled in line close behind you,  I would say use the big stall.  If you want to be overly cautious, you could turn to the line and ask "is it cool if I use the handicap stall since it's open?"      
3. If only the handicap stall is open and there is someone visibly disabled close behind you,  you could offer for them to go ahead and use the big stall.    
4. Same as above,  but there is a visibly disabled person father back in line.   You could offer to let them go ahead,  or you could not.  This is a grey area as no matter what you do,  there are very vocal opponents when this debate comes up.   Just make a decision that feels right and hope it doesn't offend anyone.     
5.  If you need the handicap stall and can wait without having an accident,  wait in line.    
6. If you need the bathroom asap for whatever reason,  go to the front of the line and ask (with appropriate urgency) "can I please go ahead,  I really have to go!"  We've all been there regardless of heath status or physical disability.   If you don't speak up for yourself, you can't blame other people for not being mind readers.   
7.  No dirty looks if someone who looks able bodied uses the handicap stall.   You don't know why they were using it,  so just be cool.    
8. If you don't need the handicap stall,  and it's the only one open,  and you are going to do something that takes a while (phone call,  shower,  hide from your boss...) wait for a regular stall.     
9. If you need the handicap stall and there is someone else who needs the stall, brawl it out.  Just kidding.  First come first served.    
  
 
I think that about covers it.   There will be people who disagree,  but I think this is a good basic set of guidelines.    Get out.  > Having worked with several wheelchair bound people in my life, 

It matters why they are wheelchair bound.  At the risk of being too graphic, people who are in a wheelchair due to paralysis often also suffer paralysis of the anal sphincter (and other muscles related to the lower digestive tract). Incontinence (but also constipation) is a frequent result; this can be minimized by using the restroom according to a schedule and "training" your bowel movements for those time periods. It's not the same as a broken leg.

I don't know whether the disabled person in LAOP's story is paralyzed...but if she is, I can see why the CEO wouldn't want to go into detail about why she needs that specific stall.

 Your idea of equality *seems* objective to you because you're able-bodied. If all the stalls were handicap stalls, your one-line-for-all would be equal. As it is, it is not equal. You're arguing from an able-bodied perspective. If the line were comprised entirely of handicapped people, "equality" would be an entirely different concept. Not objective. You're concerned with equality in forming lines, but not the fact that a handicapped person doesn't have equal ability to use both facilities. If you were to form a line for both the elevator and the stairs, and everyone has to use the same line, you're only being equal in forming the line, but not in doling out the resources. Handicapped people need equity, not blind equality. No, not everyone is capable of using the restroom! That's why they have handicap stalls! They are not able to easily use the non-handicap stalls. And that's not the same as being able to use it. Someone who can't walk can crawl up the stairs too, it's just not a morally sound thing to make them do.

There isn't a law or statute, you're right. I'm not making a legal case. I'm making a moral case. If there's a big line up in a place with urinals and stalls, and I go take a piss in a stall when there are available urinals, I'm not breaking a law.

The argument is that everyone gets the same opportunity, and that means we have equality, that's a fallacy. People with handicaps need EQUITY in order to reach equality.  oh god, he's claiming to be an attorney in another thread You are making assumptions you should not.   I just said second floor, but what if it was the 50th floor. Sure an able bodied person could make the climb, but at what floor do you draw the line between easy to reach by stairs and too arduous a climb? Who has it worse, the person standing there waiting for the elevator, or the person sitting in a wheel chair? Nobody is saying the handicapped person cannot use the stairs, but logic and self preservation would tend to sway them from doing so. Equity means being fair and impartial, so again, having people que up for an elevator deprives the handicapped person of nothing and treats them as equal to people with two legs.   If they can't use the restroom, then a handicapped stall isn't going to help.  "Easily use" and "not able to at all" are not even in the same ballpark.  I think the term is "reasonable accommodations" in most circles.

The idea that wheelchair bound folks having the same wait-times as everyone else is "getting the same opportunity."  Morally - I know people don't like being talked down to and pandered to. They want the same chances to succeed and fail that everyone else has.  Most people don't want "special treatment" they want the same, fair treatment.  Giving them a special stall that they can more easily use is fair.  Not letting anyone else use that stall, or expecting everyone to wait, is not.  

Obviously, the new handicapped lady at OP's job is not the sort that wants fair treatment, she wants special treatment.  That's called being an asshole, in most places. Lovely. He was banned.  You've offered an impartial solution, but it's not exactly fair. In the case of the stairs, a 50-floor building is going to have the elevators for everyone to have an equal chance at taking them. It's essentially an ability-neutral situation. But a situation with two stalls, one handicap, is more akin to a one-floor staircase. Your situation is like if there were 50 stalls, and 49 were handicap.

My theoretical example was if you made a single line for stairs *and* elevator, and in that situation, it would not be "equal", just like forcing them to wait in the same line as everyone else would be if we're talking a 1:1 stall situation. I think the distinction is that you’re arguing equality while they’re arguing equity. As much as we as a society like equality, we also understand that it doesn’t always lead to the best results for the group. In these cases, we as a society agree that it is better for some small segment to get an advantage while the rest is put at a disadvantage. 

Let’s take this situation. If we’re talking about equality, then the handicap person should get in line with everyone else and wait their turn. Great, but what happens when it’s their turn in line and they get stuck with the regular stall? Depending on their handicap, they might have to let the the individual or individuals behind them go ahead and use the regular stall. Because of equality, they have been put in a worse situation, i.e., a longer wait time, than they should be. 

Now let’s say at some point, the one line becomes two lines or that there always was two lines. One line for people who can use either stall and one line for those that can only use the handicap stall. Whoever is in the handicapped stall only line gets to skip the other line when the handicap stall becomes available. Are those people in the regular line disadvantaged because of this practice, yes; but it prevents the problem that can arise when using equality. 

Sometimes it’s better to use equality and sometimes it’s better to use equity.  Exactly, reasonable accomodations. If they need to use the handicapped stall, then they can't just use ANY stall. The situation is NOT equal. It's equal for you, you have access to all the stalls. They have access to one. Unequal access would be an express lane that only they can use.   You're so obsessed with the line being equal, but you haven't recognized that handicapped people don't have equal access to all the stalls. Don't say that you are treating them equally just because the line is equal if what you're lining up for is not equally usable. If there were one line for both the stairs and the elevator, you're not providing everyone equal access if one of them is not even an option.

The stalls are all the same to you, as an able-bodied person. You look and you see two stalls. To a handicapped person, there is one stall. Yet you're saying "line up for both, you're equal now!" It's farcical and ablist. People use it as a punchline, but recognize your privilege. Any person can only ever use one stall at a time.  They have a maximum occupancy of one person.  

What it seems like you are saying is "don't use a handicapped stall if there is another option."  I would agree with you on that point.  If there are other choices, you should use them.  However, if all are taken, it's not some massive social faux pas to use the handicapped stall.  I think the majority of western society agrees with me here.   It's the difference betwen a stall and a urinal. If you had a co-ed line, you would not say women are getting an equal shot. They are able to use one of the two options, while men can use both.

I didn't say it's a social faux pas to use the handicap stall, and I don't know where you got that. My beef is with your facile argument that you're giving handicapped people equal treatment.

What you do beyond that is up to you, but it should come with the recognition that what *appears* to be equal is absolutely not. Go borrow a wheelchair and try to use a regular bathroom stall. See if you like trying to piss horizontally in a toilet that’s a couple feet in front of you. Do you like to close the stall when you use it? Too bad, your chair is in the way. Now try to pivot 180 degrees to get on the toilet without using your legs. There’s a reason the handicap stalls are bigger, and a reason some people can only use those stalls. 

It’s not a faux pas to use a handicap stall, but it is to go into one with an obviously disabled person waiting without even offering it to them. It is not a hardship for an able bodied person to wait 5 seconds for the next available stall.  It's not really my argument - it's the ADAs.  I think they have more clout than either you or me.   Twenty people in line waiting for an open stall, three stalls, one is wheelchair friendly.  When a stall opens up, the next person in line takes it.  Handicapped person is in line.  When they get to the front of the que, and a small stall opens, they wait a moment longer.  The burden is - at most, two extra minutes in a worst case scenario.  

Consider that same situation if no one was using the handicapped stall.  Everyone BUT the handicapped person has to wait.  Consider if the hadicapped person could just wheel to the font of the line.  That's how it works in Disney-land, right?  No one ever abuses that system in disney land.  

I can't speak for all wheelchair bound folks, but every one I've ever known or worked with just wants to be treated like everyone else. They don't want special treatment, they want the same thing everyone else gets.  Special treatment would be patronizing, equal treatment would be fair.   The ADA doesn't rule on EQUALITY. Again, this isn't about the law, it's about decency, it's about fairness, and it's about equality. Admit that your viewpoint has nothing to do with equality, just the appearance of it, whether that's by hiding behind what the law requires or by a facile argument from an ableist point of view. You are on a legal advice subreddit.  If you want justice, there is likely a better place to have this discussion.  

You seem to have some sort of personal vendetta against me.  This isn't personal.  If you decide to make it that way, it's on you.  The fact that you are willing to call me an "abelist" really shows where your head is right now.  This is not the place for that.   [removed] The moment you started making judgment and accusations this was over.   And I didn't call you an ableist; I said you were arguing from the point of view of someone who prioritizes the able-bodied above all.
