My sister’s landlord is raising her rent because she has now become disabled and needs to use a wheelchair. Is this legal?  Raising her rent BECAUSE she is disabled (and saying on a recording or email that's what he is doing) is monumentally stupid on his part, and illegal under the Fair Housing Act if he is subject to that Act. (Most landlords are, but he may not be if he only has a few properties.) Depending on your state law, your sister may be able to file a complaint with a state/local body or with the federal [Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint)  Oh man, her landlord is so screwed.  Just FYI he doesn't have to pay for modifications, and he can require thing be undone if she leaves, but she can make whatever modifications she needs if she pays for it. The key question here is if the landlord raised rent specifically because she is disabled, or because they had to spend money.

How many units does the landlord own and do they live in one?

What state?  Depending on the state, your sister may have committed a felony by recording a convo. Its against the law. Report it to housing authority. I'm in NY as well. You can also contact the ADA for help on this.  ---

I will forward this link to her. OP said that no modifications are needed.  State of New York.

He stated that he would be raising the rent because of her disability.

3 units.

Landlord is off site. [deleted] He clearly stated that he’s raising the rent because of her disability.

I’m pretty sure that goes against the Americans with disability act.

She has him on audio telling her this. She may change her mind though. This is a new thing, and as she grows into her new life, she may want to alter things.  Different tub, hand rails near the toilet, wider doors, lower counters, etc.  Just a bit of info to be shared in case. Got it, but are they making any alterations to the unit that will cost money? You can call 800-514-0301 for the ADA  [deleted] Especially as she figures out how hard being in a chair is on your shoulders. Though she still could have some ability to walk or step. No. She’s on the ground floor so it’s all flat. She can move around in her wheelchair.

Says its illegal.

If your application for an apartment is denied because you have a disability, that's discrimination, and that's illegal. Also, if it seems like no housing is available to you because of your disability (but it would be available for folks who don't have a disability), that's discrimination, and that's illegal. If you get an inferior level of service (ie, slower repairs) 

 Yeah.  Totally depends on her current and future needs. Ok so to be clear;

Landlord is not making any modifications whatsoever to the unit like installing ramps, rails, modifications to the unit, etc? I'd bet you know what they meant, though.  No. No modifications.

She never asked and he never offered. I like how /u/pedantic_dullard is *not* the one being a pedantic dullard here. [deleted] She can make a complaint to the HUD [here](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/complaint-process).

[NYC housing complaint](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/fairhousing/renters/file-a-complaint.page)

[NY state housing complaint](https://ag.ny.gov/civil-rights/fair-housing). And he's asking for the rent to be raised while a current lease is in effect? Is this in NYC or NY state?  Not sure if I've failed you or not...  It's like people saying they have Obamacare. First that's a nickname. Second, it's (was) a law. 

But you know they mean they have health insurance, likely thanks to subsidies or have a pre-existing condition that previously prevented them from getting coverage. And the simple knowledge of what they mean really means you don't need to nitpick the insignificant specifics and grammar. Unless you just feel like being an asshole. What wrong idea might they have gotten? I just looked up the law on recording and apparently New York is a one party consent state and recording conversations is legal.

Thanks for those links. FYI: when you file with HUD in New York, unless it's a massive case, they send it to the State DHR for investigation and determination.  Meaning, filing directly with SDHR saves time (plus, DHR will dual-file all complaints with the Feds for you anyway). NYC.

Current lease is valid.

So yes he wants to raise the rent while the lease is still in effect and because she is disabled.

This LL doesn’t seem particularly bright. [deleted] Amazing. I hope your sister makes bank off of this idiot. That username to post content ratio. Get him to shoot it to you in writing. NYC has different housing laws than NY and the complexity of those laws are sufficient to justify a trip to an attorney. He's out of his friggen mind, is totally in the wrong, and cannot amend lease charges mid-lease because someone is disabled. This would be a potentially valuable suit. Sometimes they're very important, even a missing comma could be the difference between a conviction and a dismissal. This isn't one of those times. Ohh, what's really going to bake your noodle later on is, I'm not actually a landlord.  Or a Jedi.  Or /u/Zapopa. Or a pedophile.

Just throwin' that out there.

 Thanks for this. We will do just that. You once commented on a post about landlords and the OP deleted the post because they thought you were actually their landlord.  > Or /u/Zapopa.

Everyone knows/u/Zapopa is the account the mods use when they want to blow off some steam.  To be clear, you're *not* a pedophile?  Can you explain how you stopped being a pedophile?  I feel like that would be useful information.

(/s) Don't act like you know he's doing wrong, don't inform him of it either.

Just be like, "hey, for our sake of clarity can you send me a letter about this? I'm so tired from the holidays I can't keep up without notes right now." We are drunk As is tradition.  Is that the royal we?
