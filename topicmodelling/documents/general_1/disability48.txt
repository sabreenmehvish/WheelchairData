[Britain] Disabled children waiting too long for NHS wheelchairs  Sadly familiar. If you don't have a proper wheelchair (one that isn't going to lose a wheel within 10mins and you can push yourself) than how are you expected to have any kind of independence or freedom? Really ugly that such an important area is going so under funded. 

The NHS has been there for me through thick and thin, yet the government has made it so much worse recently. Iv'e had a consultant say we can't give you on the books because we don't have the money. The only clinic for one of my conditions in the country, openly telling me they can't help me because they are too skint.  We been waiting for several months in Ontario (Northern) to have someone asset my GF for a Scooter. It sadly seems like a lot of countries are suffering from red tape. I wish there was a way to speed it up she can hardly use the Canadian Crutches as is and spends more time crawling.  USA here - 6 months is the wait time we experienced here both through private insurance and Medicaid (our government insurance).   Even wheelchair repairs take months to come through no matter how urgent the need.  Occasionally they will approve something quickly but it is super random and rather uncommon.
