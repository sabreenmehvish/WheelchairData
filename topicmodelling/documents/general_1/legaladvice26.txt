(Indiana) My co-worker got a sought after position because her dad made a deal with our boss to get it for her. Her work is terrible and she's making life miserable for us by trying to make us help her use the bathroom but our complaint are ignored because she's disabled. My co-worker, Laila, is a pain in my ass.

I don't want to sound evil or mean, but it's the truth. A little bit of background here, Laila got her job because her daddy is good friends with the head of our division. Now, the position Laila's dad got her is considered highly competitive amongst the internal candidates. For those of us that have the same position, we had to pass a written exam, go through an oral career board, and then attend a month long training. Laila had to do none of that. She was given the job straight away. And they sat her next to me.

Laila has cerebal palsy and is wheelchair bound. Everytime she needs to exit our floor, someone needs to let her out. Then someone needs to let her back in. Rinse, repeat. She has a caretaker that's supposed to come in twice a day to help her go to the bathroom. Only, sometimes that caretaker doesn't come in...and then Laila begins whining at the top of her voice, or going from cubicle to cubicle, begging someone to help her go to the bathroom. None of us are agreeable to this. She also bothers us constantly to help her get in and out of her sweater and coats. Now I don't mind doing this....but when it's three times within the hour and I have a deadline coming up I can't always help.

Her work ethic is atrocious. She is incapable of performing routine tasks and analysis. She constantly badgers me for help. If one coworker can't help her, she goes on to the next, or has a tantrum. Her father has a nasty habit of calling us, her coworkers, on the phone and asking us to act as her advocates in meetings and or complete taskings for her.

Myself and a couple of other co-workers went to our immediate supervisor to complain about the situation and how it was creating extra work and headache for us to be dealing with her all the time. He told us to be patient with her because she's disabled.

Full disclosure, I've written about this scenario on reddit before, about two years ago. Management's solution was to move myself and a couple of other coworkers in the vicinity to different sections of the office. After a recent reorg, I find myself working with her again, only to discover nothing has changed. I've tried ignoring her when she constantly bombards me for help, which only leads to her whining loudly about how she needs help NOW. She still has no idea on how to do her job. Plus, she's asked us to help her use the bathroom twice, within the last three weeks despite being told not to.

HR is claiming they're using reasonable accommodation in regards to her, but nothing about this seems reasonable. Supervisors have put her on performance improvement plans, but somehow they mysteriously go away and nothing is done. Her father STILL calls employees demanding they do x,y, and z for Laila.  Is it time to take this to an attorney? Several of us are debating on contacting one as a whole. You could contact a lawyer who regularly handles ADA cases to ask their opinion. 

Assisting a person in and out of a wheelchair and the activities associated with going to the bathroom without any training is dangerous. You could injure her or yourself. 

I'd suggest you ask HR what exactly they actually expect you to do to accommodate her before making any other steps. Make sure they know you're being told to assist with the process of going to the bathroom and transferring her. Ask if they plan on training you on how to do that, and maybe ask for a raise since they're adding a very different and skilled set of requirements to your job.

IMO making random coworkers assist with toileting is not reasonable. Maybe having an aid to help her is, and allowing her to employ and bring her own definitely is reasonable.

 Separate your issues with her into personal problems and potential legal problems. The personal problems include that she's a pain to work with and whines; you'll get this with different co-workers who do this in spectacularly different problems. As for the potential legal problems, make it the company's potential legal issues. So far, none of the things you describe sounds legally actionable, and it's quite likely that hiring a lawyer will serve no purpose. 

Go to HR and point out these things:

*1. Her father's constant calls on **company time** makes you **uncomfortable**, and while you hate to cause problems, you are **feeling harassed** and would like HR to intervene and stop those calls.
*2. While you sympathize and understand her disability and would want to help, you are **uncomfortable** acting in the capacity of a caretaker, especially one you has to help with intimate matters, and you wonder if you are being targeted to take on this caretaker role because you are a woman. In addition, feel free to mention that you are worried about who would be liable if when helping her she hurts herself. And if the help you are providing involves any bending, lifting, or any form of strain, feel free to mention the twinges you have in your back after doing so.
*3. Finally, make sure to mention that all of this is interfering with your productivity and you want to ensure that having to pause to attend to this woman's needs is taken into account when your work and efficiency is evaluated.

Good luck. I didn't read all that. Could you please summarize the basic facts and leave out the personalities and drama? And how she got the job and the quality of her work product are irrelevant as you have a say in neither of those things. > Is it time to take this to an attorney? 

For what? They can employ and promote terrible employees if they wish. You don't have to help her in the restroom. Say No.  if no assistant is available and she really has to pee i can see why she would be desperate for help but it still isn't your job. maybe contact voc  rehab or ADA and see what they can do. or  maybe have her ask her friends or realitives if they can help her, someone other than her dad. does she really stink if she can't go to the bathroom? if so maybe you can Go to DHS and  say shes being neglected by her dad and someone will HAVE to  help her like a PCA or job coach You don't like your co-worker and you think she should do better work than she does.  That's not illegal.  They're legally free to have the most mean-spirited and workshy people on the payroll they can find. If you don't want to work with Laila, you can find a job elsewhere, but an attorney isn't going to make them fire her for you. Fair. Our main gripes are that we're regularly being asked by her to help her use the bathroom. She's in a wheelchair and none of us are trained to do lifts. She constantly needs help with her work and has tantrums when we don't or can't help. Her father also calls and asks us to help her by intervening for her on her behalf when she's in meetings with her supervisor or needs to complete a tasking. It's very disruptive to all of the people that have the same position on her floor. It's not really that we want her fired, but more or less want stop her father from constantly trying to have us do her work while taking us from our own, as well as having her interrupt us the majority of the day to help her with her tasks. Her verbal outbursts and fits if we can't help her are also a problem.  Unless there is a law in your location which says you must have X certification to help somebody in a wheelchair then no laws are being broken. It sounds like this is part of your job now. You can refuse, and if you are fired you **may** qualify for unemployment. You can also look for a new job.  If you have caller ID you can not answer the phone when he calls or try the old "well I guess I'm going for a walk at the same time the phone rings" move. The law isn't going to tell her father to do that, or her not to do that; management can if they want to, but they apparently don't want to. 

This is the job you've got. If it's not worth having it with the Laila problem, it's time to find another job elsewhere.
