(Washington DC) My co-worker is in a wheelchair. A car with diplomatic plates is parking in the disabled parking space in our parking garage leaving my co-worker with nowhere to park. The company and police aren't helping. Posting this for a co-worker who isn't on reddit. He is in a wheelchair. He drives a car with hand controls. When he started working here the company had a disabled space made in our parking garage for him. There are other people working here who have things like back and knee trouble, and they are assigned parking spaces close to the door but for my co-worker in the wheelchair they made two spaces into one and put slopes in the curb. It is a legally marked and signed disabled space. Now a car with diplomatic plates has been parking in the space. The people in the car don't have a disabled permit and aren't in a wheelchair. Both the company and the police say there is nothing they can do. There are no other available spaces (even non disabled ones) because every space in the garage is assigned. But even if there was my co-workers manager told him the company is not going to spend money to make another space for a wheelchair. My co-worker was told he could park in the public parking lot 2 blocks away.

We tried have someone help him out of his car inside the garage and then drive his car to the lot up the road while he came inside but a few people who did this gotten written up or sent home for leaving their desks and going out during working hours. My co-worker can't park up 2 blocks away because they are doing construction and it's not wheelchair accessible for him to get to our building. He has been written up for being late because of the parking situation and his boss threatened to fire him as well. I have no idea what to do to help him because the police won't do anything. The people in the car with diplomatic plates don't even work in our building, they just do business there. The public isn't supposed to have access to our building. My co-worker doesn't play the system or use being in a wheelchair as an excuse not to do things. He doesn't want to sue or get money, he just wants to be able to come to work without it being a hassle. I and others here want to help him but we don't know how. He must have options even if the people have diplomatic plates? IANAL Sounds like an ADA issue. He may need to request an official accommodation, and if they made him a parking spot they may have already done that. If they aren't able to reasonably accommodate him any more, he might need to talk to a lawyer.  [deleted] Call the embassy of the country from which the people in the diplomatic vehicle originate. They have the option of revoking or suspending diplomatic immunity. Also, if you live outside of DC, email your congressman and/or senator's office to inform them of the situation. This kind of "standing up for the little guy" story is the kind of thing they love.

What you definitely, under no circumstance, should do, is to steal the diplomatic plate off the car and then call the police to have it towed. You should definitely not do that. All these diplomatic immunity questions lately.  Maybe it'll be the emotional support animal issue of 2016.

Diplomatic immunity does not require that a private garage let the car in. Diplomatic immunity does not prevent a tow. 

I would contact the nation's embassy with a picture of the car in the handicapped spot, and let them know that it is preventing a person that actually needs the spot from using it. I would ask the company to paint another handicap spot, to bar the offending car from the garage, and to tow it if it gets into the spot again. 

I don't know anything about the ADA on this issue, so I'll leave that to others.  [deleted] How do you access the parking garage? How is the diplomatic car getting in? [deleted] IANAL. 

To summarize what I think the most salient points being made are- your coworker made an ADA request for accommodation in parking. They accommodated him. Then they revoked his right to that accommodation. They are are no longer reasonably accommodating him, so this seems like the problem is with the company, not the person with diplomatic immunity. It's the company's job to make sure only he can use that spot. If they are letting someone else use that spot knowingly, and kicking your coworker out of that spot, they are the ones that you should deal with.  > I have no idea what to do to help him because the police won't do anything. 

Keep going up the chain of command.

The diplomat is immune from prosecution but not from being towed. I normally don't post, but there's a lot of erroneous assumptions and/or urban myths being thrown around here. 

We don't have all the info from OP here but if it's a private lot in DC, MPD doesn't really have any jurisdictional control.  If the lot is truly private, then it is incumbent on the property owner to enforce the parking regulations (and yes, your friend might have an ADA complaint).  

However, the quickest way to the simplest resolution (that is to say, getting the diplomatic vehicle out of the designated parking spot) is to contact the Department of State's Office of Foreign Missions.  Here's their public link:  http://www.state.gov/ofm/

Give them a call and tell them you'd like assistance in resolving an issue with a foreign diplomat's vehicle.  Make sure you have the license plate and make/model info.  Explain very clearly what the issue is.  I'd even recommend you take a photo of the vehicle when it's parked in the space (if feasible) and start tracking the days in which the vehicle occupies the space.  

OFM is the U.S. government's responsible office for engaging foreign missions in the United States.  If everything you've written is accurate and there are no missing facts that might change the scenario, OFM shouldn't have any trouble sending a polite letter to the relevant embassy asking them to knock it off.  Nine times out of ten, that's all it takes.  

Hope this helps. Is anyone else getting the impression that the company wants the diplomat parking in that spot more than they want to keep the disabled employee? That they actually hope the disabled employee will just quietly go away?

If that's true, should op and their coworker approach the situation any differently? Like, getting a lawyer?  [deleted] Diplomatic plates does not stop from a car from being towed.  

You can also contact the Department of State as well. The plate belongs to them. [removed] [Here's](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234570.pdf) a copy of the state department's drivers handbook for diplomats.  It states, specifically, that if they park in a handicapped spot without a handicapped permit they can be ticketed or towed.  Call an officer out and show him this and if he won't do anything go to his supervisor and ask them to have someone ticket or tow the guy.   An ADA complaint will make it the company's problem. Perhaps the accompanying fines/penalties will change their calculus on how important it is to accommodate 'diplojerk'.

 I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[](#bot) Call your senators and complain. Also ask them who else to call.  Why doesn't one of your co-workers get there early, park in the spot, then move their car when the disabled guy arrives and calls them? [removed] why not just call for a tow truck. :P If there is room behind them then just have your friend park behind them.  If he's nice he can leave a note on their car explaining that he is disabled and has no other place to park and that they should call him to move his car when they need to leave. IANAL, I work in film, in the locations department, and it is sometimes my job to keep people from parking in places that we've rented for filming. If going through the embassy doesn't work, I would recommend buying a few traffic cones and placing them in the space, or a barricade if the driver is undeterred by the cones. Certainly, it will be a pain for the employee to move said deterrents when he arrives, but if a fellow employee who starts around the same time could be gracious enough to meet him upon arrival and clear the space, it could work, and at some point the nuisance car will stop viewing this spot as an available option. Not a lawyer. 

Call the embassy and politely complain. They should be able to help. 

Also: is there anything you could legally do to make parking there as uncomfortable and major hassle as possible for the diplomats? Ideally accidentally block them in while they're gone so they have to call someone if they want to leave? 

Not a good solution: but does your coworker need the space close to the door, or does he only need a good disabled space so he has room to load and unload his chair from the car without scratching up the neighbors? You could ask for the disabled spot to be moved much farther from the front door to try and prevent shit like this in the future.  [removed] If you don't have any luck with the embassy, you reach out to the Department of State - they publish a [phone directory](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/112065.pdf) (they update it frequently, so you can always just Google it too). I'm not 100% sure to whom you should speak, but these two seem the best bet: 

* the country desk officer in the relevant geographic bureau (e.g. Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs), as State writes that those staff "[work closely... with foreign embassies in Washington, DC.](http://www.state.gov/p/)"

or

* the Assistant Chief of Protocol for Diplomatic Affairs in the [Office of the Chief of Protocol](http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/c35647.htm) I thought this was relevant... I wonder if his country is on the list. 
http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/140432262249/parking-immunity-diplomats-owe-nyc-16-million-in [removed] [removed] You need to take pics of the car and plates and make a complaint to the FBI and the State Dep. They handle diplomatic immunity, and they take it pretty serious. This person IS NOT IMMUNE! It just means that they won't be tried in this country, but it isn't a free pass to commit crimes willy-nilly. Make the complaints to these places and it will get forwarded to the proper embassy, where the ambassador will be "embarrassed" and the shit will be cleared up pretty quick. You should also make an inquiry to your states senators...both of them.  Only one option. Fuck up the car.  http://www.staples.com/Staples-White-Inkjet-Laser-Full-Sheet-Shipping-Labels-8-1-2-inch-X/product_518346

Assuming no surveillance, print out message asking them not to park there, stick to front window. [removed] [removed] Would telling him he needs to park 2 blocks away, in a place where he has to pay for parking, that is not accessible because of construction be considered reasonable? The company says it is because they gave him an alternative place to park.

We can't even have a few of us give up our spaces because ours are not long enough and he can't get in and out of his vehicle without going into the 'roadway' where people drive so it's not safe. The whole thing is a mess. It does sound like an ADA issue, but I'd come out differently than you would.  The ADA would require them to provide him with a handicap spot.  Because they are allowing some yutz diplomat to park in the spot, they are not doing so.
 Another co-worker talked to the driver and the people in the car a couple of times but the driver just said they don't want the car in a public lot or near other cars. Thanks for the info about contacting the embassy. We will look into that. This does sound like the most straightforward way to get a solution, although OP sounds like he can't use work hours to monitor when this guy comes in. Perhaps asking the parking attendant to have a conversation with the driver could help. Be aware it's entirely possible the driver doesn't speak English very well or at all.  Yes, this.  It looks like the coworker's only other recourse might be an ADA complaint and a lawyer, so if you can make a personal entreaty to the embassy or consulate in question, now is the time. Anther option for DC residents, calling EHN's office or a city councilman. I see what you did there... [removed] hahahahahaha funny idea tho  We'll be contacting the embassy that the plate belongs to.

The company has already told my co-worker that they will not be spending money again to make him another space. They own the property the garage is on. They are on board with the diplomat parking there and not interested in towing the car or banning it from the garage. My co-worker has asked them to and they refuse.

Edited for a word A couple of times the cops have given them a ticket but they all say they can't tow. I was saying in another post above that the company probably owns the garage and they say there is nothing they can do and have no interest in helping. I don't think any of us are authorized to get the cat towed because we don't own the property. We are going to look into contacting the embassy. Thanks for your  response! During working hours they leave the garage doors up and there is a booth with a guard who checks everyone's employee ID as they come in. They are letting the diplomatic car in because it has diplomatic plates and the people don't want their car in a public lot. They told my co-worker they can't do anything because of the plates and none of them want to lose their jobs because the company is on board with it.  He is usually there before my co-worker. None of us are allowed to park in the space because we aren't disabled and don't have a permit or special plates. Blocking it would block the 'roadway' and other people couldn't get by, it's too narrow. We would get towed. Once my co-worker who is in the wheelchair got there in the morning before him and he was threatened with having his car towed if he did not move his car. We were all pissed but he complied only because his car has hand controls and without it he would effectively be trapped because he can't drive a regular car. So while it's a good thought unfortunately this isn't an option.  Thank you for this. I see it in several of OPs comment replies, but it should really be edited into the body of the post. The employer of the handicapped worker has specifically advised the operator of the diplomatic vehicle to park in the handicapped space.

The dispute here is between the employee and the employer.  Ehh, in DC he kinda is immune from being towed, unless he's blocking traffic or an exit or entrance or something. 

DC cops are supposed to radio in to dispatch for diplomatic plates, and then they usually have to wait there while the superiors go through hours of red tape and political bullshit.  Most cops figure thats not worth it for something like this. Thanks! It was helpful.  I'm also wondering why they have other workers with assigned spaces, but not for the disabled gentleman. 

Sure he may be the only one with a placard, but what's to keep another worker from becoming disabled and using his space. > You can also contact the Department of State as well. The plate belongs to them.

Thanks for the suggestion. We'll look into contacting the Department of State. Unfortunately our company owns the property the garage is on and they are on board with him parking there and not interested in helping with the situation or having the car towed. *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

If we call a tow truck it would not be able to come onto the property or tow the diplomatic car because the company will not give authorization. This is not an option for us. If does that he would be blocking the 'roadway' and no other cars  would not fit or be able to drive past
 Unfortunately since they own the property the garage is on (and the garage as well I assume) we can't put cones or barriers up because they told him/us not to and they are on board with the diplomatic car parking there.

Thanks for you suggestions though. They are appreciated.  He needs a wide space so he can get in and out with his wheelchair without denting or scratching the cars in the spaces next to him. It doesn't need to be close to the door but there needs to be a slope in the curb nearby so that he can get from the 'roadway' to the sidewalk. Unfortunately the company is on board with the diplomatic car parking there and have said more than once that they won't be spending money to create a new space and slope for him. We can't block the diplomatic car on because that would block the 'roadway' and no cars could get past going either way, it's too narrow.  *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

Because of the layout of the garage if we were to park behind them to block him in because then the entire 'roadway' and no cars would be able to pass. We are doing what we can but this is an option and doing so would also be illegal (and none of us have diplomatic immunity) The garage is on property owned by the company. Only the company can authorize a tow truck. None of us can authorize this and the tow company cannot legally come on the property without the company's authorization. The booth guards also will not let a tow truck in. Gluing a notice to a windshield would still be considered vandalism. *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

I doubt that it would be. Do you guys have an HR department? Are they aware of the issue? HR departments are there for the benefit of the company, and one of those benefits, is keeping the company from being sued over stupid shit like this, so he might want to go to them if they exist and aren't completely useless. ADA has a clause in there that a reasonable accommodation needs to be made. Parking two blocks away in a paid spot isn't reasonable. HR should handle this for the employee

 Right, that's what I mean. They seem to think it's more reasonable to have a diplomat park there than a valued employee who needs it. They either need to get him to move or provide another spot. Don't go to the driver.  Go to the embassy and explain the situation.  Embassies don't like to be embarrassed by the actions of their employees.  Take pictures with you showing that he's clearly taking the only ADA parking space. In addition to, or rather, instead of contacting the embassy, I would recommend going directly to the State Department. Your co-worker has zero leverage with that embassy as a private citizen, but that is almost certainly not the case with State. Find out who the U.S. Ambassador for that country is and contact their staff.

EDIT: Also, the ambassador's office will likely be grateful to you for letting them handle it rather than "going over their heads." You're U.S. citizens, it's their job to represent you. [removed] The driver does speak English, another co-worker of mine talked to him twice. We don't have parking attendants but the booth guards are letting the car in because of the plates and say there is nothing they can do and don't want to get fired. Agree with this.  Call Eleanor Holmes Norton's office.  I have found them to be very responsive.

And I also want to add that your employers sound like dicks. *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

Even if they don't grant the request to paint a new spot, it's good that your coworker asked. It shows that he tried to resolve the issue, and the company said no.  The company can't assign a different parking spot for that car? I'd think it would add to the valued customer vibe, being given your own parking spot. [removed] Is the garage a private garage, or run by some government agency?

If the garage is private, your friend can threaten the garage with a lawsuit if they don't start barring the diplomatic car from parking in that space.  Diplomatic immunity doesn't prevent a private tow company from towing a diplomatic vehicle from private property. Getting your friend's car towed for legally parking in the spot would be illegal. If the diplomat tries to do this he's giving your friend ammunition. This wasn't the people in the diplomatic car. This was people from the company we work at. Sounds like this private property so the owner/manger can have it towed and banned. Police do not even need to be called. If I'm not mistaken, if a car with diplomatic plates is parked illegally, the police can have that car towed to a legal parking spot and it does not need to be the closest legal spot, just a legal spot.   This spot is his assigned spot. But because the diplomats like to use it (presumably because it is close to the door or keeps other cars away because it is wider) the company is on board with them parking there. Every employee has an assigned space. The garage doesn't have any spaces and the company told my co-worker that even if they did they aren't spending money again to make him a space. If I understand OP correctly it is an assigned double wide space for his coworker. The DoS will contact the person parking there and their embassy. The Embassy/country does not want things like this to be in the press.                  

That and immunity is not a 100%, even DoS says this...          
"Most of these privileges and immunities are not absolute, and law enforcement officers retain their fundamental responsibility to protect and police the orderly conduct of persons in the United States."

The problem is that the police can't ticket car because it would be ineffectual, not that they actually have the right to park there.  There's no need for the parking attendants to be letting the car in, and this would be the easiest solution. How does doing something they are not suppose to do help them avoid getting fired?

The garage is on company property. The guards who work in the booth are employed by the company and are not from a private security company. One of my co-workers or I will double check on that though. Thanks!

One question. If it was actually owned by a private company could my co-worker call to have the diplomatic car towed? Or would it have to someone 'in charge' like a boss or someone from the guard booth?
 If they towed his car out of the his assigned disabled spot, and let a non- disabled car park there, wouldn't this open them up to a pretty serious lawsuit?  Even better. Your company doesn't have diplomatic immunity, and they're the ones actually responsible for giving your coworker reasonable accommodation under the ADA. Towing his car from the only handicapped space really sounds like the opposite of reasonable accommodation to me. This is ludicrous. They must be paying your company to park there. What a clusterfuck of idiocy. Diplomatic posts don't mean you can park wherever you want. Is this diplomat even working in your building? Where is your friend parking now?  The company (who owns the property the garage is on) is on board with them parking there and won't help with the situation or have the car towed. At some point it devolves from a legal issue to just being about what the cops are willing to do. 

And in DC, there are no legal spots that you could tow a car in to.  Its hard fitting a smartcar into the parking downtown.  > they aren't spending money again to make him a space

Even not for
[one of these](http://www.thatsmyspot.com.au/WebRoot/ecshared01/Shops/hatsmyspot/4E30/1EA9/6C0A/34FB/08AA/C0A8/D240/792F/tms_mg_790_640_animated_full.gif)? It's a small investment that makes sure only he can use the space...  Thanks so much. We will look into this. My apologies, it won't happen again. Then they need to file an ADA complaint. http://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm

edit - cleaned up url Make sure you have picture documentation over multiple days of the car being parked there, physical evidence that you've reported this to police and supervisors, and written confirmation that they're asking he park in a paid lot two streets down.

You can also report this to the embassy of whichever country is involved, as they tend to not prefer their immunity be abused for things like making disabled people lose their jobs.

Edit: Also any punishment, citations, or job-related criticism based on his inability to make it into the office in a timely manner (along with other employees being punished for helping) would be extra helpful to have in writing. Get that in writing or email. Paper trail. That is not reasonable.  Get things in writing, ask them for reasonable help like a parking space reserved. If they refused then get ready to sue them. 

The man with diplomatic plates is a dick but untouchable but it is the company's responsibility to make sure that reasonable accommodations are given.

 Totally wrong.  What's reasonable is using the provided space in their own lot.  Get a lawyer. Realize that what was posted is the Justice Department's guidelines for internal requests for accommodation.  It is really not applicable to your situation. DC resident here. 

Hey OP, what country is it?  Its possible that hey come from a country without any kind od ADAesque protections, and they have no idea how theyre breaking the law? 

If they're Saudi/UAE/Qatari diplomats though, you might have a problem.  Im not being racist against Arab people, just against their diplomat corps/upper class. Im sure you all have seen stories of their entitlement in the press. Not all of them are bad, but enough that its a problem. 

The "oh I have a nice car and I have the right to park it wherever I damn please and ignore any of the peons talking to me about it" is a distinctively Saudi/UAE/Quatari minor nobility way of operating, and I had to deal with way too much of that bullshit in high school. The shitty thing about that is that they might be some random prince of something who just live in the US with diplomat tags but who arent technically part of the diplomat corps. So contacting the embassy might be useless.  Definitely do this.  When US diplomats go abroad and show their ass they get dealt with seriously.  It's a poor reflection on their country. [removed] Seriously what a horrible situation. It's tough enough for disabled people to break through prejudice and land a job, then to have it threatened by an entitled ass?? She *should* flip her shit. The problem is that I am not in charge of the booth guards and neither are my co-workers. I can't tell them what to do. They are afraid of being written up because the company is on board with this because the car has diplomatic plates. They are just doing what they're told. > don't want to get fired.

They will not deny entry, and an employee trying to school them on the legality of it will probably get nowhere.

Call the embassy. The guards could absolutely deny entry, however this could likely get them fired. The guards presumably work for the building.  If the guards deny entry you can bet that the tenant company will raise a stink with the building.  Most buildings would not think twice about firing a minimum wage guard to keep a business tenant.   That's exactly my thought. Do diplomatic plates just basically get you whatever you want, whenever? Why would they put their jobs at risk to stand up to someone with diplomat plates? This is a very idealistic suggestion. The police have been writing tickets but since the diplomats don't care and are immune it doesn't help.

The company is on board so the booth guards have no choice but to let the car in. They are employed by the company too. Even my co-workers and I understand that they are just doing what they are told. If you make trouble, you get trouble. The whole nail that sticks out gets nailed thing. This is especially true when you're in a job where you're very easily replaceable.. *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

*If you feel this was in error, message the [moderators.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLegalAdvice)* If the garage is owned by a third party, then they would need to call to have the car towed.  But your friend has leverage to get the garage to do this:  the garage is possibly creating an ADA violation by letting the diplojerk park there and not doing anything about it.

Buuuut... If the garage is owned by the company you work for, then your friend may have more difficulty with the situation, if the company bosses are turning a blind eye toward the diplojerk in an effort to maintain a good relationship (e.g., if their country is a customer or something).  In that case, I guess I'd suggest your friend going to HR about it.  Hopefully someone there realizes that there's a potential lawsuit risk if the company continues doing nothing. My first thought is "hell yeah it would". A part of me really wants to be there if this goes to court and some rep of the company has to explain that they gave him his own disabled spot, then barred him from parking in it. He's parking in the public lot and a couple of us sneak out and carry his wheelchair to the sidewalk and hope no one gets written up for leaving during working hours. Or he'll pull up close to the building if he can and he goes in and someone else parks his car. Not ideal but we all need our jobs and can't just tell the company off. Then a ADA complaint will fix that real fast. That and contacting the embassy and DoS as well. So let me get this straight....

1) employee is handicapped.
2) employee's handicapped spot is taken on a regular basis by a diplomatic car.
3) police won't/can't help
4) HR has been ineffective
5) The driver is unhelpful
6) The company who owns the building is "OK with letting the dip plated car take this employee's only spot."

So there is your real asshole.  The company that owns the building.  Have HR, a lawyer, whoever write a letter holding them responsible. I just posted the drivers handbook for diplomats from the department of state in another post.  Looks like it doesn't even need to be to a legal spot, they can ticket or tow them for being parked in a handicapped spot illegally. Because the garage is on their property the company will not allow any types of cones or barriers in the space and someone who tried to put cones there was written up. The company is on board and okay with the diplomatic car parking there.  I also deleted my comment, it was a joke about pulling a car out of that spot which would be illegal as well, and a joke isn't helpful in this sub.  Sorry. He can't be legally held responsible, but that sure as hell doesn't mean that his car can't be towed every time he does it, the embassy can pay the tow fee. Bet it doesn't happen twice. While that might be true, public shaming seems to be the way to go when dealing with them. Lots of pictures and video of them being a douche going viral can't easily be ignored.

Look at what happened to the guy driving like an ass in Beverly Hills. >Im not being racist against Arab people

So this is a private lot?  If so, it sounds like the company is defacto not providing an accommodation by allowing the car to park there.  It's not a legal situation beyond the ADA.  IA(clearly)NAL. The company owns the building and the property that the garage is on. We are the only ones here and the company employs the guards. The booth guards have already been told that the company is on board and the car is allowed in. I think it has more to do with being a big client  Can you call a tow company? Having to get your car out of the pound a few times might make that spot not seem worth it. [deleted] This is just messed up on so many levels. I feel so sorry for him and you guys for risking your jobs to help him.  We are looking into contacting the embassy as well as seeing about an ADA complaint. The company seems to think that telling him to pay to park 2 blocks away where it is not accessible because of construction I'd a reasonable accommodation. I'm thinking they are wrong about that.  The police have been contacted on several occasions and they say they can't do anything beyond ticketing the driver because of the plates. So they are under the impression they can't tow the vehicle and while some of them are sympathetic it's generally not a good idea for us to pick a fight with the police. Well, it might surprise them to know that the fact that their lot is privately owned does not allow them to dodge the ADA. Someone should anonymously call a tow truck. That's true, they really hate being shamed, I was wavering back and forth about including that in my comment because of the contact the media rule.  Its not even necessarily that. In threads mentioning diplomatic immunity in this sub its always advised to inform the embassy. Diplomatic immunity isn't supposed to be used for their convenience and pleasure. Those plates are for things like not paying tolls or meter fees as they are used for diplomatic business. Parking in a handicap space once or twice isn't super unreasonable even, if they are on some urgent business or transporting some old diplomat guy and they need to park up front. But if you tell their boss that this guy has made the only handicap spot in a private garage his personal parking spot and some disabled dude is wheeling 2 blocks through a construction zone and about to get fired his higher up is gonna be like "Halihd, what the fuck man, park on the street".  Regarding the Beverly Hills thing, could the police have seized the cars bring used? Is the property of the immune protected? Fuck off, Im not playing your little game. 

If anything, this just shows I hate fabulously wealthy entitled people.  Sorry about that.  No idea. I think the company is either sucking up to the people in the car or they are afraid of losing their business. All I know is that the company is on board with them parking there and they have repeatedly told the booth guards to let them park there and said to my co-worker there is nothing they can do. I'm wondering if you could approach someone (your manager? HR?) and ask them to take the spot or spots required for the car from other able bodied employees and have them park 2 blocks down?  I assume this is a temporary situation. There is a 'report' link under every comment if you feel so strongly about it. For the love of god, get us an update on this when it's all said and done. I'm salivating at the amount of god damned justice your company deserves.

PS: Your management sucks. Hard. The more I think about this, the more I want to reiterate that the poster above this comment is right, contact the Department of State, and contact them **first**. If you cause a flap, it's going to be a headache for the U.S. Ambassador, too. Save them that headache, they're on your team and they get paid to help Americans deal with that country.

I would talk to the ambassador's office about the possibility of an ADA action (and mention it could involve that car being towed) *before* you take any steps in that direction. They definitely don't want that, and like I said, they're on your team. Forget the police.  The beef is with the business owners and you can go straight to the Department of Justice to file an ADA complaint against them:

http://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm
 You could show them the handbook, or call the station and nicely ask them what you can do to get them ticketed or towed? Because they own the property the garage is on they would have to authorize the tow truck to come onto their property and they aren't willing to do this. None of us or the booth guards have authorization to do this and even if we call anonymously the tow truck cannot do anything without authorization from the company.  It's all about phrasing. Nothing in my post directed or encouraged OP to contact the media. So the guy is a client or related to a client? Having worked in the DC area for 10 years I am well aware of the "suck up to client above all else" mentality. We would do this for him in a heartbeat but the normal spaces aren't long enough for so he can't get out and take his wheelchair out without being the the 'roadway'. The spaces are also on angles so if we give up our spaces from him to park there or we park it his car is too big and it will mess up the other cars. The company won't consider helping out with trying to change the situation.  No kidding. His coworker is going to have one hell of a story to tell at parties when this is all done. I disagree. Regardless of who they are allowing to park there, they have totally reamed this disabled guy. They basically took away his ADA accommodation but even worse told him he has to park 2 blocks away and wheel through a construction zone and are now threatening to fire him. The abuse of the disabled employee by this company is more important than parking and diplomat issues. On top of that the parking situation may be somewhat easily remedied but the company already screwed this whole thing up and screwed an employee.  Gotcha. 

Then /u/questionthrowaway899, if theyre oil money diplomats take this into account.  I meant take the other employee spaces for the diplomat's car.  Is it a limo or just a sedan? Your employer must accommodate a disabled employee for parking.  They have no obligation to accommodate a random diplomatic car.  You need an attorney to start and ADA violation suit. This whole situation is total non-sense. [removed] Blocking or parking in the space without a permit is illegal and therefore not an option for us since none of us have diplomatic immunity.  We can't block the space either because then the 'roadway' would be blocked and no cars could pass on either side. Also the company told my co-worker when he did get there early one time that he had to move for the diplomatic car or he would be towed and that he had to go to his assigned space.
