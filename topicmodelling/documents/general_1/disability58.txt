Wheelchair cushions. What wheelchair cushions you are using? I m sitting on wheelchair 15 years and I had bed sores 3 times. I had "roho"high profile and now "comform". I use a Jay3 cushion. It’s gel, or what they call “flow fluid”. I used to use Roho, but they just weren’t comfortable for me.  I heard that NXT cushions are really good and that they are designed by a fellow who is actually wheelchair bound. Also apparently Vicair has great cushions, they are air cushions.
