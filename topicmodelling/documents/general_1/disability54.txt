Engineering Design Project- Electric Assist Wheelchair Hello Everyone! I need your help with an engineering design project for my senior engineering thesis. My group is looking to build a device that will help people with  mobility issues, and we have a few questions for your consideration. Please feel free to give me any other feedback that you may have. The survey is a google form linked below and should only take a few minutes of your time. Thanks!

The responses in here will be taken into consideration when designing our senior design projects. No personal identifying information is asked for in the survey, and replies are completely anonymous. Data from multiple choices may be included in figures and short answer replies may be quoted in the final thesis paper.
