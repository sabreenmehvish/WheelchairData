"You never appreciate my gifts, you either lose them or misplace them" Anyone else have difficulties taking care of gifts/not dropping freshly bought clothes on the ground/not forgetting about gifts you were supposed to use.

It has made me seem really ungrateful even though I am really touched by the gifts.

At this point I honestly dread receiving any gifts other than money because I will just feel guilty in the long run. Hmm... by that standard, I also don't appreciate:

* My keys
* Money
* My purse
* My phone
* My keys, again
* Books
* My glasses
* Large bottles of laundry detergent
* Plane/train tickets
* My keys, again
* My shoes

(BTW, does anyone else semi-regularly misplace your shoes? That's a hard one to explain, "I was late because I couldn't find my shoes"...) This is like the only real conflict I have with my mother. Otherwise she is super supportive and we have a great relationship. 

BUT STOP GIVING ME EARRINGS!!! I've asked her repeatedly and she keeps doing it. She's very understanding about other aspects of my ADHD, like punctuality and whatnot, but for some reason can't figure out that it's hard for me to keep track of small trinkets. It's just a blind spot. I've come to accept it about her. I'll say thank you, and put the earrings in the same mystery drawer of all the other stuff I will never use, and if she gets upset about it that's her business. 

She hasn't seen me wear earrings in 20 years so at some point it's on her.  Ask for experience gifts instead maybe.  I think lots of people, ADHD or not do this. Most people neglect presents they don't really like/care about.

To be honest I never buy anyone a physical gift unless I know its something in particular that they wanted or told me they needed.

This is why I stick to cash and gift cards. Saves a lot of hassle and time. I got a car stereo for Christmas and even put it in for me and when a lady crashed into me and totaled my car about 6 months later  I just left it in there to be taken by the tow truck  Yeah that’s true too — I just feel like if the person said “as a gift I’m taking you to drive a Ferrari around a race track on Friday the 17th and handled everything ...that may work. 

Side note though is that I also have gifts that I never use and wouldn’t be able to pinpoint their exact location which may or may not be my house. Car, work, etc. it’s kinda not good gift etiquette for a gift giver to even complain about that.  Oh yes,the shoes. 

I always misplace them by forgetting to take them off and then taking them off wherever I notice and chucking them into the nearest corner without really realizing it ...then you forget about it, lose the paper or let it expire. Or you have to shell out money to get to the 'experience' and it's a crock of shit. I'm speaking from experience lol. It's so good in theory but in reality they hardly work out. I still have a coupon for glider flying from 3 years ago that I never turned in. Woulda been fun probably.
