My past self rocks! I forgot to take my meds before heading into work, and I later found an extra dose of pills that I had packed in my work bag and forgot about!  Good on ya, Past you! 

Now be good Past you for Future you, and replenish the ones you took in case this happens again! (in case you forget...) I stash pills in my purse and desk for this very reason! The exact same thing happened to me today... We are ninjas! ðŸ˜Š  I got a [keychain](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fc4BdZWtL._SY355_.jpg) to hide my meds after somebody saw me take the bottle out of my bag. Luckily it was an empty bottle and I only keep one dose with me, so I told them I was all out. In before my next post here is cursing my past self for my forgetfulness lol 

Iâ€™ll try to remember! I wrote it down in my to do list! (Now I just have to remember to check my to do list...) Same! No, no "trying to remember", remember? We're not good at that, and convince ourselves we are!

Go move that sticky note to your keys/backpack/pants so you cant move/leave till you do it! Um.... what if the sticky note is on your keys and your keys are on your wallet but youâ€™re already in a rush so you grab the sticky note and put it in your pocket so you donâ€™t forget and lose it? 

Or....

Grab the sticky note and go to do what it says while putting it in your pocket and forget what you were doing and notice how late you are and rush out forgetting your phone, wallet or something else? 

And still lose the sticky note right before you remember you have a sticky note with something important on it.... Maybe make an alarm on your phone thats annoying af and repeats itself until you do the thing? My momma told me thereâ€™d be days like these...

Weeelll? Did you do it!?!?
