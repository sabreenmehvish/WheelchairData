Ordered the ‚ÄúMastering Your Adult ADHD‚Äù workbook ‚Äî and I have no idea where I put it My doctor suggested I try this workbook to do some at-home CBT with this workbook. I put it somewhere in my house and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs lost forever üòÇ If you're like me, it's obviously sitting in that pile of *other* books about ADHD that you ordered immediately after getting diagnosed but never got around to reading. "At-home CBT" such a wonderful thing to issue to someone with a massive procrastination problem.  Bought ‚Äúdriven to distraction‚Äù on kindle and then immediately forgot I bought it Did you check pile #872J?  :D This is the most ADHD thing that I have read in a while! Hey, props to you for remembering to actually order the book after leaving the doctor‚Äôs office. üòÇ If you buy another one you'll find the first one guaranteed haha What is the best workbook for adult adhd? My doctor drastically reduced my medication and I am desperate to make myself normal.. I tried bullet Journaling but it lost my interest after the first week when I couldn't make it look as pretty as the examples I'd seen - _- >being able to read books with ADHD

Man I envy you. Oh my.. Just realized you included the name of it in the title.. *facepalm* I love reading this. It‚Äôs a bit like the time my SO and I started a podcast on procrastination. It‚Äôs been months and we haven‚Äôt finished it yet.  I keep all of my books neatly thrown under my bed. I am so glad I found this place. Seeing my life played out my so many others, really helps me.  My best strategy in these situations is to lose and then try to find something else ;)

Btw, thanks for reminding me, I need to order that book so I can also lose it! I bought a copy on Kindle. And another similar book. About 4 months later I "discovered" the physical copy on Amazon and ordered that because I was certain it would be helpful. It was about 2 months more before I realized I had a digital copy and physical copy of each.  ADHD should have been called Catch 22 Disorder

"Need medication so I don't forget things"
"Forgot my medication" Lol. The irony of our lives. I say its in the drawer in that thing that looks like the thing you bought last year but its red and smaller then that thing. It right next to that other taller thing in your room next to the door where you keep all your clothes, you know ummmm fuck whats it called, your closet! Yea its in that drawer somewhere near there I bought that... haven't touched it since.  I got 99 piles and the book ain't one... There's a WORKBOOK? I ‚ù§Ô∏è homework like that! Gimme gimme! I have like 3 book-books, but I haven't read them. But somehow a workbook just seems like it would be a thing for me... Looooool, classique. One of the biggest "jobs" that I gave myself when I realized that I had ADHD was to "find a home" for everything. I'd never done it before and was used to just throwing my shit around everywhere. It's hard work and I have to be so vigilant EVERY DAY .. sometimes it even takes me speaking to myself out loud like "Ok, self. You have just hung up your keys ON THIS RACK. Take a second. Take in this moment. This is where your keys are" - and then I walk away, lol. Because so much of ADHD "forgetting" is not forgetting at all, it's because we didn't make the memory in the first place when we did the thing.  Ha! I do that a lot and then I have to think - "now where was that smart/strategoc/logical place I put that....it used to be here about halfway down the pile on this shelf, but I moved it somewhere...."  organizing or cleaning or just putting something in a different spot than normal is disaster! I often look at a pile or in a drawer and give it a half look thinking surely the object isn't there. Then later I give it a better look after I've checked everything else multiple times and whaddya know, there it is in the place I already "searched thoroughly"!  ;) üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ I was going to read that book but haven't gotten around to it yet. It's probably next to the other exact same workbook that you forgot you already bought.   Digital books help me keep up with them since I'm always staring at a screen. But reading more than 1 chapter is another story. I have close to 400 books on my phone and I've literally only read the first chapter of every book, I hate it. I read that book and used it in an ADHD group therapy course. Good book. 

I always leave my books right by my bed. That way I never lose them... or I just use audiobooks. I have over 100 of those and keep them on the cloud and on my phone. I can't lose those very easily
 Lol, you are hopeless. If you find it again, glue a long strong inside the cover and tie it to someplace, like they did of old with books using chains.  Preach Hahahah i just lold 
Good job dude right there with ya  This is the book my therapist did with me and we completed a couple months ago. It is a pretty good one and uses the ASRS symptom tracker which is an excellent tool especially when you're trying to figure out your meds. 


Though I have to say I like this one: http://www.mentalhealthprofessionalsinc.com/Forms/Adult_ADHD_Self-Report_Scale_(ASRS-v1.1).pdf
much more because it is targeted towards adults.


So my only suggestion for the book is to use this symptom tracker instead.  Reminds me an awful lot of when I bought "The Smart but Scattered Guide to Success" at the suggestion of my therapist, so we could work through it together in therapy, and then both my therapist and I kept forgetting to bring our copies to my sessions. üòÇ I'm pretty sure my therapist has ADHD too, haha.  damn it! this post is great!

good luck on your hunt.  I hope I'm not being to forward, I'm one of those ADHDer's with boundary issues! lol what country are you in? I'm in the US and I could give you some advice on experiences I've had but it may not hold and other countries, like Canada or Great Britain, where they have universal healthcare. I totally understand! I was recommend 2 books about ADHD since I started ADHD treatment. So I got them lent from another library to mine so I could lend them. I read one and a half pages of each and proceeded to not read them, and they are well beyond a week overdue. I came in to say exactly this! I have a Kindle now and that helps a lot! I never would have read Driven to Distraction if it didn't come in an audiobook format The accuracy of this comment hurts me. So it would be a good idea to buy a similar book and wait to see where OP places it I've been trying to finish "A New Understanding of ADHD" by Brown for well over a year, I feel attacked. I got 7 of those! Read 3 thus far, but only skimmed the rest. Ugh.  Like telling someone to take a pill to stop their vomiting. I love that book That's my problem with all digital purchases; I immidiately forget about them. Last time I bought a digital movie on Amazon I bought the Blu Ray a week later. I even got to the 900s pile and still it's nowhere to be found Your piles are numbered?! Wow. Now, That's impressive work. While I believe in a multi-disciplinary approach to treating ADHD, what up with your doc? I would equivocate that to a doctor telling a diabetic that he is going to reduce his insulin and better just tell his body to make more. I had that problem with it too! I did this workbook with my therapist, we would read it together and work on it in therapy. It can also be done alone but is better when you have someone to keep you accountable. lol oh no I just bought one today! Maybe I can at least make it last 2 weeks! I looked into bullet journaling and found it overwhelming! The instructions on r/bulletjournal say its whatever you want it to be but I find myself being unable to: A. Actually starting it B. Decide on what type of notebook to use C. follow through D.(wait, what was I just writing about?) E. Consistently writing in it once I FINALLY get started. (good times)

EDIT: Spelling I used to do paper bullet journalling, but I'd forget to bring the darn notebook with me and was too focused on filling it with stickers, so now I do a basic form of it in Evernote and I'm not only able to get at it whenever I need to, I can also really quickly add things to my daily page when they pop into my head because I'm pretty much never without a device that has Evernote on it. Maybe try that out? That way, you don't have to worry about making it look fancy. (and in my case, it means I can actually read what I've added, because my handwriting is pretty bad at times)  I'm trying bullet journaling and keeping it minimal without the zealous designing and pseudo-scrapbooking I see on Pinterest (that my girlfriend is fond of). I have a monthly log, daily logs (on day three of consecutive logging), and longer narrative pieces. I don't have cool images or fancy calligraphy, just quotes occasionally.  You can't hyperfocus on a book? I have entire days of my life get eaten up because nothing else is enough of an emergency to override laying in bed and reading for 14 hours straight. Epic! (yes I am old, and so is my lingo) can't go wrong with a good long strong I love this idea, but soon my apartment would become a tangled mess of string!

On the bright side, since there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an ADHD equivalent to gaydar, it would give us a way to recognize each-other in public. Just look for someone a screwdriver or other random object dangling from their glasses because they got the string tangled again... dropped my kindle in the tub That guy‚Äôs my doctor! When it hurts so bad it's good! I laughed out loud! Same! I have so many unread ebooks because I literally forget I bought them on sale.  I literally cannot read books on my Kindle because I have so many free books on there that it is overwhelming. Hiding them does nothing because they are still unread. I like physical books in shelves and neat piles. There's something about the visual clutter that really gets to me. I like bookshelves, too, because they're pretty and concrete.  Post its.  Post its everywhere. He is a new doctor for me since moving, and the first thing he did during my first visit with him was drastically reduce my dosage. That was in January, and I have my 2nd visit with him on Monday, so I can only hope that he was trying to see if I really needed it (even though I've been medicated for over 5 years now). I will write down everything I've messed up since having my meds reduced for him if I have to... He mentioned something about my history with insomnia, but I tried to explain to him that I had insomnia before I was ever medicated. It's frustrating because I just started my first beginner office job and I start college classes for the job next month.. I won't let him mess up the tiny amount of success I've managed to build.. Hmph. I also asked him for a referral for a therapist and he told me that I needed to wait until my next visit (this Monday) to get a referral. I will make sure to speak my mind to him about that one... Mental health treatment shouldn't "wait".

^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/7o7jnj/blacklist/) For me it takes me awhiiiilleee to get into a book, but once I‚Äôm in it all I wanna do is read! I have this thing where a book can be too stressful or too funny sometimes and I'll take a moment to process the emotion and that's enough to break the spell a bit but it's also what makes me want to read it more and it's very confusing. I used to hyper focus on books until I got a smartphone when I was 14. It's been downhill ever since. Story of my life. When you next replace your phone, get an IP67 or better rated one, then use that as a kindle. Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that and I would do that to so no reading in the tub for me! OH SHIT that's when I stopped! Not at 14, I stopped after sophomore year in college I think when I got my first smartphone! I picked it back up again last year, I love it...rereading Atlas Shrugged (just finished it for the first time), I know it's hyperfocusing and a bit of aspie obsessive but I honestly don't care, I love reading a ton again. Yes, this is a great idea. IP67 are waterproof/resistant. Medication makes my eyes REALLY dry especially around allergy season resulting in difficulty reading for long periods of time. I purchased my Kindle Paper White to alleviate this and reduce light-emitting diodes that give off blue light. (the kindle still gives off blue light but not as much as, lets say, an iPhone.

EDIT: missing "a" in first sentence. I've also been trying to get back into reading. But probably not Atlas Shrugged lmao The new Kindle Oasis (although much more expensive than the Paperwhite) is waterproof/resistant. Best of both worlds. Or get a Kindle cover. They're essentially extra-clear ziploc-type plastic sleeves that you slip your Kindle into.  I'm coming out of a codependent relationship with an alcoholic who cheated on me for years and gaslit me, so the whole "A is A" and differences between a trustworthy man and a looter that I found so dull at the beginning was honestly cathartic by the end of it. I read it over the last 6 months and I want to reread it to make sure I actually absorb all of what it was probably saying when I wasn't initially in a state to hear it.

When I started reading it, I didn't even realize how much it applied my actual life. I just thought it was capitalism grandstanding and kept reading because the plot was great. Now I get to go read it from a whole different point of view lol.

Which also helps me postpone reading through Lord of the Rings in full for the first time, so, win win. Oh okay, Thanks for this information! hey man, if it works for you it works for you. Glad it's helping. Me too! And woman actually lol Let's pretend man is gender neutral for a second üòÇ In that case HELLO THAT'S ME haha
