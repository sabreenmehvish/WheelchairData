I just had the most ADHD experience of my life While taking a shower this morning I realized that my bodywash bottle was empty. So, when I got out I took the bottle with me to throw away. I walk into my room and ten seconds later I look down and see an empty soap bottle in my laundry, and my clothes in my trashbin. I'm like "oh god," and put my hands on my head....and then realized I forgot to rinse the conditioner out of my hair...

So how's your guys' holidays going lol Had a very adhd experience (Ive been diagnosed with ADHD Combinded) the other day when I straight up left my suitcase in the middle of the Swedish airport. I was fiddling with a water bottle then saw my dad walk on so went to join him and completely forgot I had a suitcase for about 20 mins. The airport was very displeased and also 100% thought it was a bomb.  Incredible.

I called to make an appointment with my new psychiatrist, hung up right after setting the appointment date, and immediately forgot what it was. Well at least you thought to replace the shampoo bottle, right? 

Speaking of shower related ADHD experiences I have gotten in the shower and turned the water on only to realize I was still wearing clothes mutiple times üòÇ Today I procrastinated going to the store by... leveling out the end of my gravel driveway, for 5 hours, by hand. I hurt everywhere, am sunburnt, but my driveway has much better drainage now! A while back I accidently stole the pneumatic tube shuttle thing that Walgreens sent me at the drivethrough.  I didn't realize until I got home and had it in my kitchen... Then it clicked that I had way more packaging than usual.  I brought it back and explained "so, I was here to get Adderall and I feel like that's sufficient explanation"


Last Friday, I set off the locating Tile on my work badge because I couldn't find it in my car anywhere when I got there. It startled me as it was already on my neck. Went to WM in the 104 heat for Nivea body wash in the 25 oz pump bottle, which is sold out online but ‚Äúin stock‚Äù per their website. Came home with $80 worth of lawn & garden supplies, new sheets, and shampoo but no Nivea body wash. Grr.  I love how I come here, read this, and have a laugh about something that could easily have happened to myself and made me despair.

Thanks :) I once left my debit card at a restaurant about an hour away from my house. I didn't have the time to drive back and get it and they weren't going to mail it to me, so I requested a new one from the bank,  received it in the mail a week or so later... and promptly lost THAT one. I had to call the bank AGAIN and request another card. 

The person I spoke with actually laughed at me.  Been there. Found a neatly folded t-shirt under my toaster once. This morning was easily my worst ever.

I accidentally shaved a big chunk of my beard off so had to shave the rest to match.  Had a shower and got out without rinsing  the soap off. Realised I'd forgotten  my wallet as I was  about to leave the house, so had to go back inside and find that.  Then set off for work and halfway there realised  I'd forgotten to take  my meds so had to go back again.

All was ok after that though.. apart from my lack of a beard being a spectacle at work. At work today I was filling a cup with ice. Had extra in the ice scoop and instead of tossing it in the ice bin I dumped it on the counter. Why? Who knows üòÇ I'm honestly just really impressed you managed to take the empty bottle out of the shower with you. I have at least 2 or 3 in my shower right now and EVERY shower I take I see them and think about throwing them away, but then, of course, I finish my shower without doing it. 

I can relate to the rest of this so much tho lmao My new oven has a timer on it (which actually switches the oven off) - this has become a life saver for me, so I am much less likely to burn food now!

Today I made me some waffles (Birdseye potato)
Excitedly returned to the kitchen 20 minutes later after I heard the timer ‚Äúding‚Äù.

Frozen waffles were sitting on the counter.
I had set the oven, but not put the food in it. Doh. Hugs for you all..  MY people!  I lost my bagel while I was eating it this morning....found it in my bathroom....


Not the first time I‚Äôve lost food while eating it.  I was in the middle of watching a show yesterday when something they mentioned made me want to google it. Two hours later I finished the episode.  I was trying to fix a lamp a couple days ago and had a part in one hand, and a lightbulb in the other, and needed to drop the part to screw in the lightbulb. 

Not only did I forget what hand each was in and shatter the lightbulb all over the floor, but while *in the process of cleaning it up* I zoned out and forgot I was cleaning up glass and stabbed my finger with a shard. 

So that was a good evening üòÖ Yesterday i managed to lose my keys and phone in the same dayüò¨    I tore the house up looking for them only to find my keys on a little shelf onmy dresser and i had my phone with me all along it just slipped off the passenger seat of the car onto the floorboard.    I swear i looked my car up and down before and didn't see it? I guess you tend to miss obvious things once you get worked up into the adhd "can't find my shit" AGAIN frenzy.       I‚Äôm in my hotel room being very diligent to make sure I had packed everything and inspected the room.

I‚Äôm at the airport 10 minutes before boarding and I realized I forgot to take my ADHD meds, I checked my bag and recalled that I had left my meds in the hotel room. I called the hotel about my situation, they went into my room to find my meds, a pair of shoes and my sunglasses. Thankfully they mailed to my home all items.

Once I got home I realized that I left my watch going through airport security. That was permanently lost. 

To say the least, I felt like a complete incompetent moron. :(  Few weeks ago I arrived at doggy school only to realise I left the dog at home.

Usually I remember when I get off the driveway. Toaster in the fridge, milk in the cupboard.

Garbage in my purse, phone in the garbage can.

It's a problem. On more than one occasion I've lifted both the toilet seat and laundry bin lid as I do in the morning. Usually I get naked for the shower, pee, and then get in the shower. This routine has me fixed into thinking I need to throw my laundry into something so I end up throwing my damn laundry into the toilet. At least it helps wake me up. The other day I was making tea. Realised while sitting at the computer that I couldn't hear the water boiler. Forgot to start it... Goes into the kitchen and start the boiler and realise that it's suspiciously light... 
No i hadn't forgotten to put water in the boiler, I had already poured the water and three seconds later the timer on my watch went of. I had forgotten that I had poured the water, I had forgotten I had set the timer and I didn't even think of looking at my watch if I had set it or not.  Forget the other things that happen to me in my life everyday. While reading the main thread, I got distracted maybe four times with other thoughts in my head and I had to **re-read** the **first sentence** of the main thread again, again lost my attention, then had to read it the **fifth time**, by the end of the **second sentence** I'd forgotten what was the first sentence, hence had to return for a **sixth time** to read  and then somehow ended up reading the whole thing and the comments that others had posted.

**I'm new to reddit** (first ever comment actually) so don't mind me if I happen to confuse you with anything up there. Haha amazing Oh man. The other morning I was shaving...well was about to shave and had shaving cream on my face...then next thing I know I'm standing there with the shaving cream around my mouth and chin gone. No razor in my hand. Not sure where the shaving cream went. Apparently I wiped it off with my hand..idk. Felt like I was losing it. Definitely letting go of any thoughts I have had about trying a straight razor.  I poured milk into the top of my Brita jug the other week. I was making cereal and refilling the Brita at the same time.


I feel your pain. My day was less interesting. I just arrived 1.5 hrs late to my job, which fortunately has a pretty flexible schedule. That‚Äôs really ADHD, haha. I‚Äôve had a pretty ADHD experience yesterday. I made a drink for myself with some milk. About a few mins later, I hear my dad asking why there‚Äôs a half full carton of milk next to the trash.  I opened Reddit, and forgot what for. I once rolled my eyes during a conversation with someone and forgot what we talked about and had to ask them what we were talking about. I still don't remember what we were talking about.  Yesterday I put water from a large cup into the trash bin instead of the sink. At work. I panicked and emptied the trash bin in the sink..... I don‚Äôt have a diagnosis yet, but have appointments this month. Every now and then i will accidentally wash my face with shampoo and wash my hair with facewash. Then my face gets dry af. This isn't the most ADHD thing, but i rarely grt to post about these experiences because... Well because i tend to forget about them.

Last night and this morning, while preparing for work I carried around with me a pair of socks I had intended on wearing when I got to work. They were supposed to go into my bag. They didn't!

Luckily I had a pair in my work locker... used once, but they passed the smell test! (Because at the end of a long shift who wants to take the extra step to put them back in your bag to go home, just toss em into your locker and get yo sandals on gurl.) I managed to barely study for my physics final. Am very nervous.
But will probably be OK as long as I dont panic. Yesterday I was doing laundry and texting my mom, so I set my phone down on the edge of the washer while I sorted everything through. Turned on the washer, shut the lid, sat on the couch to realize I didn‚Äôt have the phone. I started to panic remembering that it was on the washer and started freaking out because I couldn‚Äôt find it and was 900% sure it was completely soaked. After a few minutes of panic, found my phone on the kitchen counter??? I don‚Äôt even remember going in the kitchen. I lose my wallet way too much, one day I just couldn‚Äôt find it, I checked everywhere in my small apartment, I even checked behind appliance and behing my desk or tv set. Checked the fringe abd in the oven, checked the trashbin too, not there. I was calling to report I lost all my id‚Äôs and to have new one when a small voice in my head told me: ‚Äúthere is one place you didn‚Äôt check stupid.‚Äù I hung up and yup my wallet was in the trashbag i was going to throw outside. \*slow clap\*

A real hat trick! Congratulations!

 I came sbd read this post and was reading the comments and thought what the fuck is this post about? I totally forgot everything i read haha jesus  Lmao at that point I'd just go back to bed and start again.

And by "go back to bed" I mean go back to bed, conditioner and all. I'm so happy this doesn't just happen to me (on a weekly basis at least) \\ I work at a movie theater and today I forgot about the popcorn batch I put in, and I'm pretty sure it must have been burning for at least 5 minutes by the time I wandered over to it. The sad thing is, I had walked by it when it started to pop, thought, "That has to be dropped in a minute," then walked past it 3 more times and stood 2 feet away from it while making coffee for a customer. Luckily it was my nicest manager and she just jumped in to help me (I couldn't just dump it or it would ruin the rest of the popcorn) and we laughed about it. I've literally never seen anyone burn a batch that bad, though.  Sometimes I go to the bathroom and 2 minutes later I‚Äôm asking myself if I went to the bathroom..  Jesus Christ this is me üòÇ  Yesterday I took ¬£10 out of an ATM, got distracted by overly enthusiastic charity fundraisers and forgot to take the ¬£10 out, went to buy a coffee, realised I had no money, went back to the ATM and took another ¬£10 out, started thinking the charity fundraisers were mocking me, went to buy a coffee, forgot to pick up the coffee and walked out of the shop without it. Lol. Thanks for sharing. Nice to know I'm not the only one! I put all my towels into the washing machine today, turned it on,walked away.Later went to have a shower and just as I finished remembered I have nothing to dry myself off with. üòÇ It was 6pm, I was watching Netflix and playing games on my phone, because you know I can‚Äôt just do one thing, somehow ended up on Pinterest until 2 am. I‚Äôm looking at the time, telling myself to just go to bed but I just can‚Äôt stop. And now have to rewatch half a season of the show because I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. And I think they replaced an actress on me....  OMG yes. Also this reminds me that I once squirted contact solution up my nose because the bottle looked similar to the nose spray bottle.  Had an ADHD experience where I took my socks to throw in the washing machine only to realize I threw it in the trash can üòÇ have you ever looked everywhere for your phone.. only to realize your talking on it?   I'm glad you got it back though.
Last week I left my bag in the train never to be seen again. I have been trawling the lost and founds since without luck. Lost my best fountain pens, clothes and a book of personal poetry going back about a year. Real shit experience...  Plot twist: it was a bomb! and now we're all involved Ohhh shit that sucks...when I lived in Philly for a minute I would take a bus home every few weeks to get cheap groceries (there's an insanely cheap discount store by my parents house) and visit my boyfriend. One time I was so broke I literally had no food so my mom and I packed up an enormous suitcase full of food and stuff. Like $250 worth from a regular store. Next day we drive to the bus station to bring me back and when we get there....no suitcase. I left it on the driveway next to the car when we left. Fuck.  I'm picturing the scene in my mind:  


"Oops, dad, I just realized I forgot my suitcase"  


\*returns to where (s)he left the suitcase\*  


\*sees suitcase alone, on the floor, with several police officers surrounding it and people keeping a good distance\* Did that exact thing, they told me the date and time first then went on a long tangent about Medicare fees (Australia) then hung up, realised 20 minutes later I had no idea when my appointment was... If I'm not setting up the appointment in my phone *while* I'm setting it up with my doctor I will 100% forget. I know this and I still don't do it thinking I'll remember it later.  That's always an embarrassing callback. I am just super glad that I set up daily text reminders with their office a week before my appointment.  Every. Time. I do this every time!  I think this is why I developed a compulsion to have pen and paper at hand whenever I make a phone call, even when it's to a friend or something... omg this happened to me basically every time i schedule something on phone. Pen & Paper is my best Friend now Alright, hot water, shampoo on...ah shit, my glasses!

Me at least once a month Socks... always socks Can't forget to take your clothes off to shower if you don't sleep in clothes! For me its always forgetting that their is conditioner in my hair... For me it‚Äôs usually accidentally shampooing twice, or forgetting if I shampooed already or not I think you're going to appreciate this :)

[Primitive Technology - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn1DEeyqaT4) > "so, I was here to get Adderall and I feel like that's sufficient explanation"

5/7, best explanation. I‚Äôm going to steal that. Former retail pharmacy tech. 

Thank you for bringing it back. No one ever does. Shit happens.  I wouldn't even judge them.  > A while back I accidently stole the pneumatic tube shuttle thing that Walgreens sent me at the drivethrough.

Non-American here, what even *is* that? Today I went to Walmart cuz I kinda wanted some ice cream. I left the store with a small rotary fan, $40 worth of various themed socks, Robin Hood: Men in Tights on DVD, and Edge of Tomorrow on DVD. I didn't even look at ice cream XD Ugh, this is why I hate supermarkets. And Amazon. But especially supermarkets. There's just so much stuff, everywhere, and it's ALL brightly coloured. I must look like I'm on crack, head swivelling all over the place like a loose hose.. My bf got annoyed with me yesterday because we literally just went in target to get beer, and I disappeared probably five times to look at ice cream and stuffed animals. I came back with a watermelon (which we haven't even eaten yet).

Idk if this is my adhd or just bad shopping habits tbh I've had to request a card so often that my credit union now charges me üòê  Never lost my credit card, but once I left my ID on the 7-11 scanner/printer.

Didn't even realize I left it until I went to 7-11 a few days later and the staff gave it back to me while I was shopping.  I have like six Costco cards. I thought they were all interchangeable because every time I clean out my wallet and forget to put it back in I just get a new card. I went in and tried to use one of my replacement cards and they informed me that they cancel them when I get a new one. So I had to go get another new card. This time I made a goofy face so I know which one is the current one.  So I travel a lot for work/family things and once I was in Boston visiting a high school friend and we went to the movies. I bought some popcorn and put my credit card in this tiny back pocket of the running shorts I was wearing which I promptly forgot existed. So I cancelled the card and found it after I had ordered a new one and got around to doing my laundry. The bank was really nice and rush sent me one because two days later I had to go to a wedding in California where my dumbass left my credit card in an ATM at a casino so yeah I was never going to get that one back. Called the bank again and got another card and the $2000 charge taken off. Then I flew to Toronto after the wedding for a meeting and while I was at security I handed the agent my new card instead of my nexus pass which was embarrassing but then I got so flustered I left it in the bag scanner and that's how I got a very concerned call from the anti fraud department at my bank.

Tl;dr I had a credit card replaced 3 times in a week because my ADHD ass kept forgetting it's important to keep track of these things.  I‚Äôve found a bong in the microwave once and spice cabinet another time.  I found an ashtray in my wardrobe once. Don‚Äôt know how long it had been there R.I.P. flabbybumhole's beard.

 I was at a friend of mine's housewarming party, beer in hand, when I forgot I had the beer in hand and promptly spilled it all over the floor while gesturing. Cue massive embarassment. At church I was helping run our coffee area. A man asked me to pour him some coffee. I grabbed the cup upside down without realizing and started pouring coffee onto the bottom of the cup. Once I realized, I flipped the cup over to normal and flung the coffee that was on the bottom onto the floor. I then grabbed another cup UPSIDE DOWN AGAIN and poured it on the bottom AGAIN. The guy laughed and didn't say anything I felt so embarrassed lol I do this all the time! And when I‚Äôm done, I put the cup onto the tray where the scoop goes.  When I'm showering and see those bottles, I pause my shower and prioritize throwing the bottles away, then resume showering.

Otherwise the bottles will be dicking around in my bathroom for a year. I‚Äôve done this. Was tasked with baking a pizza for BF and myself on an evening we‚Äôd both had busy days and it was way late for dinner. Put pizza in, check, set microwave timer, check, go do something else. Timer goes off, open the oven....frozen pizza. Gotta turn the oven on to cook a pizza, dummy. I realized at that moment too that I was so into what I went to go do while it cooked that I failed to notice my apartment was not starting to smell like pizza. My apartment is tiny with little to no ventilation (one patio door, one bedroom window, same wall....zero cross breeze) so it is obvious when food is cooking and it takes a long time to go away. I should‚Äôve noticed.

BF wasn‚Äôt pleased that the countdown to dinner had to be restarted, either.  I do the same thing, I can barely get my shit together enough to watch a single (20 min) futurama episode in one go :( Oh man, I lose crap all the time and I'll look all over, then maybe find my phone on the toilet (on the lid where the water goes. I think it's called the water tank? Anyways) and sometimes it'll be outside for some reason. I then remember I have to leave and that's why it's out there. I once looked for.my hat and was so desperate I asked someone very urgently and got the response, "Uhm, sir, it's on your head." I was SO embarrassed I said sorry like a million times :P I I will now always check my head for my hat before I look anywhere else now. Taking out the trash with my backpack in the other hand. You can fill in the rest...

Edit: the trash goes into a dumpster, btw. Yesterday I made tea. I set a timer too because otherwise I will forget that I made it and it will get cold/super bitter. Timer goes off. Cup has a dry tea bag in it. I do that with Google a lot :P Sometimes when I'm talking my mind decides to quit. I have to backtrack and figure out where I was. I try to play it off like I forgot a word but it know it's not convincing. No pressure (hopefully) but good luck! I go through that every time I hand in an assignment so I know what it feels like. Go get it! And you had forgot it was ‚Ä¶ Definitely. You could also explore doing a bullet journal. I know that some ADHDers find them indispensable due to their flexible structure.  I always remember to take my clothes off, but sometimes I'm starting the shower and "huh, everything's more in focus than usual -- oh god damn it." I shower with my glasses on for the most part, but I take them off when I wash my face and hair. I never had a good place to put them for this, so I recently bought a suction-cup tray to put them on next to my towel. It's been super useful. Sometimes I get both my glasses and phone. Thank god for waterproof covers  I prefer to shower at night so that strategy might not work out for me Thanks for that. Just spent WAAAAY too much time watching that YouTube channel.  Imagine Augustus Gloop in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. He gets sucked into that tube that transports chocolate. In this scenario, Augustus is a plastic container you open to put items like IDs and cash in, place in the tube, and it‚Äôs sucked up and delivered to the banker.  A drive thru at a pharmacy or bank may have many lanes, so they use pneumatic tubes to send meds or ids back and forth to the person in their car when they're not right next to the actual window. ELI5: It's a large cylinder used to teleport things. Sorry for the shoddy explanation, it's past my bedtime and words. That's not an American thing. They used to have these in banks in the Netherlands as well. It's just a tube system to get stuff to another place in the building fast. Used to be in use a lot more when computers and the internet weren't that efficient yet. I've also seen them in banks and offices twice as a kid. Using them in big pharmacies would still make sense.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BE7J5n3saec  My wife has to send me multiple texts when I‚Äôm in target to ensure i get what we need. i like Edge of Tomorrow. worth it, i think. Forgetting about the ice cream was the one aspect of dieting that was easy for me. If we have sweets in the house, I eat a little on the first day after buying them, and then completely forget to have any more. Often like 2 weeks later I'll think of some cookies we had and check the pantry, be shocked that they're gone, and get mad at my husband for eating them all so fast until he reminds me how long it's been since we bought them. Unfortunately the same applies to vegetables, which go bad much more quickly, but luckily my husband reminds me about those. He conveniently doesn't remind me about the cookies because he's concerned about my health.... yes I'm sure that's the only reason. Couldn't agree more. It drives my husband nuts that I can take so long at the store when I went there for two things. I lost my card so many times in a year that they said they would have to charge me if it happened again üòä Oh you came back for your ID?

Uhm... Yeah... Off course I did I have left two cards in last two months in the card reader for the car vacuum at 7/11. I like it! Oh man, I used to keep my bong in the spice cabinet on purpose. XD This reminds me of the time I shook my chocolate milk and forgot I had taken the cap off.  Lol that's good. Done that, also the variation no tea at all, but that might have been with the help of my wife, me and my wife makes tea differently. 

We have chosen to drink tea that can handle being steeped at least for 10 minutes without being bitter. It also help that I don't mind drinking tea and coffee cold.  I just failed the class. *snort* lmao Beautifully ADHDd comparison  > ELI5: It's a large cylinder used to teleport things.

I'm sure I'm not the only kid who thought the things were really teleporting when I was 5, so this really is a perfect ELI5. I really want to use one of those.  Ha, I didn't even get to fake it!

I was going to pay for the stuff I was buying and the staff was like, "please wait!" And ran off.

Came back with my card. I was so confused because I didn't realize that I didn't have it. 

What is this? This isn't mi-oh Haha this is my ID.....omgkillme.

I'm also foreigner where I live and am legally required to carry it with me. Police can stop me and do an ID check legally at any time. Oh no, I feel bad. Any support I can give? I'll be good man, I'm retaking it in summer 2.

I appreciate it you! At least you get a second chance. Good luck on it! I really hope you do well :]
