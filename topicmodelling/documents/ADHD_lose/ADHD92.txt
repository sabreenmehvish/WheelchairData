LPT: if you catch yourself saying, “I’m going to put this here so I remember where it is later”, abort immediately. You will never find this item again. Unless, of course, you buy it again. Then you’ll find it immediately, regardless of how long it’s been missing. 

But if I didn’t “hide” things for myself to find, then how else would I procrastinate for hours by obsessively searching my house for some insignificant and unimportant thing instead of just doing the massive amount of work that I already don’t have enough time to finish? Hahaha uuuugggghh.  I like to say out loud "I am putting [my keys] here". It's kind of like how writing something down helps put it in your long term memory. Extra pro tip: have one or two dedicated places in your room/house to automatically put all the “things you need to remember where they are later but don’t have the time/place for right now”.

Like a drawer, and/or a basket/decorative box(...?). That way when you are looking for *TheThing^TM* later, you only have one or two places to look and it will definitely be there.

Extra extra pro tip: go through these spots every couple months and find all sorts of cool things you forgot about, like gift cards, all 4 (eventually) of the missing pegs for that shelf you wanted to put up higher... maybe a couple bucks in winning scratch tickets or not yet expired coupons for that thing you really need to buy right now.

I have a drawer by the front door, and I used to also have a little dish in my room for small things. Saved my butt so many times! The amount of stuff that have fallen down the side of my bed and I’ve thought “ah I’ll get it in the morning” and then never do is terrible. In fact that’s probably where my watch has gone “I’m going to put this important document in a safe place so that it doesn’t get lost” = Magical incantation to banish item to another dimension  I don't think I generally have this exact problem, but I do have an issue with putting things right by my front door, so I don't forget it when I leave, only to inevitably walk right out the door without the thing when I do leave. This has happened so many times with paperwork (Doctor's orders for lab work; coupons), things I'm supposed to be returning to a friend or family member, sunscreen, keys, etc., etc. I’m loving a turn of phrase I learned frm this thread “Future self” like when I decide I SHOULD put gas in my car Sunday night so I’m not screwed while rushing Monday morning. Or putting keys wallet phone charger on the “launch pad” by the door. These are GIFTS to my FUTURE SELF. 🙏🏼 Yes. And have a list that you repeat. 

Phone. Wallet. Keys. Name badge. Strap. Etc. 

And use zip pockets if you are on the move.  The way I deal with finding things is, if I want to put something where I'd find it again, I think to myself, "where is the first place I'd look for this later?" and poof, I've discovered the new home for this thing. Not true. I am guaranteed to find it 6-12 months later. Have you been following me around? 🤣 I totally agree. Unless the item is going back to its Home™️ or to the Landing Pad™️, I catch myself just putting things where they don’t belong because I know it will get moved (by husband or dogs or cats), and then I’ll have a hell of a time finding it later.  I thought that only happened to me. Any time I say (or even think to myself), "I'll put this here so I don't lose it, " it's inevitably lost.  It's like saying or thinking that invokes some reverse curse. I always say out loud "I'm not going to forget that I put X here". It doesn't work that well. Idk how real this is but I recently heard that instead of saying "I won't forget that I...." Say "I will remember that I...."  Yes!! I do this all the time. I needed a makeup thing I lost about 8 months ago (have looked for it extensively on and off since then) and told my friend the surest way to find it was to buy a new one. We went out together to get a replacement and I shit you not, an hour after we came home I found the old one. Works like a charm. I call that PUTTIN IT SOMEWHERE SMARRT This reminds me of all the times I remember something I need to do while trying to fall asleep and telling myself “okay it is VERY important that I don’t forget this.” Then I wake up the next morning and only remember telling myself that phrase but not whatever it was I was supposed to do.  I've tried to be so good about that, careful with my organization, leaving things I know I'm not ready to sort yet on the dining room table for when I can really look at it...

But goddammit at some point I found the most genius fuckin place to put my social security card and I'm never going to find it again (till I get a replacement ofc) So damn true. I misplaced my keys for an entire week. They were in a new fanny pack that I had worned for 1(one) day of bike riding!!

Oh well, I found them and now they are back on the hook at the kitchen entrance door. Oh wait...oh yeah they are still there, just checked!

&#x200B;

Success?!?! I really hope I find this spot again. There is so much cool stuff there... Speaking of which.. does anyone know what to do if I lost my car registration sticker that came in the mail? I learned not to put things where they would be safe. They're safe all right -- safe from me ever finding them again (until I've replaced them, of course. I have a TON of my kids' birth certificates).

When I need to not lose something that isn't a routine item, I first look for it in my home. Like, ok yes it's in my hand, but if I've forgotten it's there, where would I look for it?

Then I put it where I looked first. If I can't put it there, usually because I have 3 children, then I put it in the next place I think to look. I love this. To those that haven't got a "landing pad" for phone, keys, sunglasses, maybe phone. Please do!

Personally I don't sleep with my phone, I leave it in the living room and it's Bluetoothed to a cordless phone system. Yeah, so true. I lost my favorite necklace that my parents gave me when I was 15, and I know it's somewhere in my house. How can I find it? I've had that happen to me! I had just moved into my new dorm, and I didn't want to leave my SSN card in my wallet anymore. I put it a safe spot so I would lose it....A few months later, I needed it but now I couldn't find it! I ended up having to go to home state to order another one.  Get back home... and I found it. Fail lol.  THEN, this summer my mother had sent me new copies of the insurance cards. I put them in the SAME safe spot! A month later, I need them because I'm traveling and I wanted them on me in case something happened... and I couldn't find them.   I get back from my trip, and find them again. Why do I keep putting important stuff in this spot?  I keep forgetting where the spot is! If, however, you're saying "I'm going to put this where it *actually belongs*, because I'm sick of not being able to find it", you're on the right track. Shout out to the time i lost my ti84 for weeks and had to buy a new one off craigslist. Then i got home and immeditately suspiciously eye’d a footrest with laundry on top, my old ti was underneath this laundry. Funny how the brain remembers or recogizes things like that. Luckily the craigslist seller was a cute girl so at least i can remember that and not just the shame of buying a calculator only to find my old one minutes later. Eh this usually works for me :P I remember stuff by walking around and seeing what i left on all the usual surfaces and that's why there is a tile on my keys and wallet.  Truth Yes! I constantly remind myself that if I’m conscious enough to think that I just need to put it away.  I think that strategy would work if an item I'd want to remember the location of would be left with stuff I never forget about for 99% of the time, like my phone, wallet, and wedding ring. Haha! This is exactly how I ended up mailing my passport application without the required photos, which I was oblivious to until a week later when I found them safe and sound on my desk.  I actually have a pretty good memory for that kinda thing. The problem comes when I clean up & organize everything in my messy place all at once... Then I can only remember where I I had put the thing previously, not it's new "neat and organized" location.

The exception is my new game & electronics organization system that I bought an ikea dresser for specifically. But that took planning. "Sudden organization" never seems to stick in my brain. I lost a $300 Ruby ring like that. When my oldest was a baby, before I met my husband, I splurged for my birthday/mother's day on a simple but pretty Ruby "mother's" ring. I sized it and wore it on my ring finger (to avoid being hit on) when I got married, it didn't really fit on another finger. I "hid" it somewhere in the apartment that I just knew I would find it, but if someone broke in, they wouldn't. I never saw that ring again. I'll be married 12 years in February. Years ago, my grandmother hid a precious heirloom so burglars wouldn't find it and she left a note in its place that said, "I've taken this and hidden it elsewhere." She couldn't remember where elsewhere was. If someone else puts something down and something about it is curious/weird (the location, object, how they did it, what was happening at the time), then I will probably remember it and can tell them with an extraordinary amount of precision where it's at. But God help me if I put something down.  I had this problem, so I decided to set a few very specific spots around the house where I would place things. Now if I'm missing something, I just check the spots where I always leave things. If it's something I need to store for a long time, well then I'm pretty fucked. I usually throw important things in my nightstand drawer and hope that they're there when I need them.  Just lost my handicap placard last week by saying this.  Dedicated spots for things/topics are super helpful.  
Boxes of all sizes + Ikea Kallax/Expedit is a lifesaver :D

&#x200B; Oh my gosh. I've had this problem for as long as I can remember. How does it seem so obviously at the moment that your sure you won't forget it. Yet the item has now fallen into a wormhole and will only reappear if you have given up on looking and have forgotten and replaced it. I have a beautiful silver pen. It's metal, really smooth and writes in a thin black line, I love it. So every time I have to do home work or something I'm like 'so where is my nice pen? I can't write anything until I find it!' And then I usually proceed to search the house for an hour, eventually discovering it on my desk or in my pocket.  Out of sight, out of mind is a big thing for me. So is, like, EDC shifting. I often wear vests, carry bags, wear the same style pants so that I can't forget things. Thinking and remembering don't mix. When I say this, if it’s something actually important, I usually take the time to write down its location in the Notes app in my phone. Not only does the act of writing it down help me remember later, but I can also just use the search tool if I do forget it and it should be there.  The number of times I clearly remember thinking that and yet still can’t remember where that was, omg it’s painful. FACT Man, I can’t find my engagement ring right now. I’m not super worried because I know I took it off in the house somewhere, but I’m a bit worried. I’ve run out Ritalin so just fuck my life already  I have procured several wicker baskets to throw stuff in, in visible  central places of home.   
They also sell cute minibaskets (size of a glass of water) I throw the keys in whenever I walk by them . :) True story, I can put it right on my computer keyboard and I'll selectively blend it out of my view. I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/u_tastelikepenguin] [LPT: if you catch yourself saying, “I’m going to put this here so I remember where it is later”, abort immediately. You will never find this item again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TasteLikePenguin/comments/9ewhsj/lpt_if_you_catch_yourself_saying_im_going_to_put/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* I lost a flat head bit to my repair set because the other night I put it "somewhere safe" before I went to sleep. Still have not found it...... it was my favorite bit :( I just did something similar recently and spent over 2 weeks searching for a book that I "knew" was just somewhere at home, work, school, or in the car. I cleaned and searched everywhere. Finally, I went to my email to find out when I purchased the book on Amazon. Couldn't find an Amazon order receipt. Instead, I found a library notice that my book would be due in 3 days... in June. Turns out I checked out a book I thought I purchased and already returned it. FML. I’ve learned that if I put things in the first place I looked for them I usually come out okay.  Not 100% foolproof because you end up with wandering items that never really find a home, and it drives my SO crazy at times .... but better to keep the vitamins next to the plates (because that’s apparently where they go?) than not take them for months and then go “why am I feeling so crappy?” Before eventually discovering that you have three bottles stashed in different rooms. I've had this thought for a while now of getting a notebook and physically writing down lists of things (classified into some categories) and where I put them. I'm convinced if I came up with a logical system I could actually adhere to it. Somehow I never got round to getting that notebook... I lost my TV remote control. It’s been missing for 6 months. As a result, I cannot switch between Chromecast and cable. I’ve been paying for cable that I haven’t used for about half a year because I can’t find my remote control. My keys live in either my pants pocket or a white metal canister on the shelf. If they ever get put down somewhere else, I know I will never find them ever again (though I do accidentally leave them in the front door now and then.... thankfully I have a security gate I always lock) I have one of those janitor clips on my keys to keep them literally attached to me at all times. I specifically leave them attached to "yesterday's pants",so when I get up and move them off the floor the keys jangle and remind me to be careful not to lose them. Welp I moved rooms, in the same apartment, on the 1st and lost my damn keys. Im beginning to realize they are just becoming part of the lore of this apartment and my spares are my new regular keys. Me too!! I think this is a great thing to help remember things I like to pay attention to what something looks like when I put it somewhere, like taking a mental photograph. I guess it's much the same thing. I like to tell my wife. I am putting the screws to this door in this draw.  We have a Sorting Table next to our front door, it's positively *covered* with things we need to deal with but not right at this moment.

And lately we've been putting our shoes there because our 1.5-year-old has taken to playing with everything in reach, especially things with dirt on one side and strings on the other. >not yet expired coupons

I mean, who are you kidding... :( Reminder to check for your watch and the rest of the stuff in the crack of your bed Did you find your watch yet But If I leave it behind my dresser, it will stay there!  Huzzah!!! My mother did this constantly.  This is why I have a safe for my ADHD prescriptions and the bottles themselves.  They belong in there and not anywhere else.  I'll take out a couple days supply and leave them in the 'designated place', but I don't want to deal with the hassle that is trying to get a replacement for schedule 2 meds or Rx papers.

Edit:  Plus I have teenagers, they aren't going to mess with them, but I don't know 100% of their friends, or friend's friends. I do this with such regularity I convince myself I have dementia. Ill pick important stuff off my front door handle and throw it out the way, as I'm running late as per, only to discover it was the reason I left the house, when arriving at my final destination I usually make it all the way to work without my work laptop at least once a month. It's an hour commute in traffic. I also forget my badge, which I usually won't turn around for unless I am only 5-10 minutes away from my house.

And I frequently manage to walk out of my house in the morning, locking the door behind me, only to realize that I don't have my car/house keys in my pocket. Last month I did it twice in a single week. Yes, this.
The number of times I’ve put my backpack with my work laptop against the front door and showed up at work without it... I mean if it was just forgetting it, but I’ll actually move it out of the way and leave without it!
Not so much since I started taking my meds before getting up, but boy it’s just baffling how your own brain works sometimes eh? Put stuff you need to remember under your car keys, that way you cant leave without them Yes! My future self is so happy right now because my exhausted evening self packed my lunch for tomorrow and one for both kids! Now I can slow down a bit in the morning and actually drink my coffee!! Keys, phone, wallet, keycard, laptop, clothes.
Check it every morning before I close the door, works like a charm! 
Except when I forget the laptop. Or when I think “backpack-check!” but later it turns out that backpack does not equal laptop. I call them “me, myself and I” Haha, my boyfriend's is "phone, key, wallet, testicles". That last part I think is just to make it more memorable, they're not detachable lol This is so my trick, it works nearly flawlessly once it is a habit.  Me: Where's my swimsuit? Where would you put a swimsuit if you were me?

Bf: The fridge?

The struggle is real, and he knows all efforts are futile. What about taking a picture of that place, with your phone?  I just thought of it myself, so I don't know if it will work, but it might.  So I'll try it too. In Georgia you have to pay for another one ($10-20) and go into the tag office to complete this transaction and show DL.  Stop looking for it..and lo and behold it's on a hanger with a cute blouse. You just wanted to see how the necklace would look with that particular blouse. Most likely on the floor of your closet behind the shoe rack.

I've been in the same situation. That's where I have found many of my jewelry pieces. Put important papers in your top left dresser drawer. Heard about Tile here on this subreddit!! Good item. Could have been worse, you could be paying adhd tax of two+ months of library fines! I’d consider this a baby win tbh.. No source button on the side/bottom edge? :’( the struggle is real my friend  Yes, this exactly.  My keys either belong in my pocket, or on a hook in the garage that is their **home** [1].  I have spent so many hours of my life searching for them, and my god damn work badge.  So so many hours.  It's a little tiring just thinking about it.

[1] "You little son of a bitch ball! Why you don't you just go HOME? That's your HOME! Are you too good for your HOME? ANSWER ME! SUCK MY WHITE ASS, BALL!" Haha toddler’s paradise! Haha aspirations... Still haven’t looked 😂 I defiantly will later though  Just looked and found it!!!!! > under your car keys

No. Put them ON TOP of the keys. If they're under the keys, you can just pick up the keys and walk away. 😊 I guess he keeps them in a bag  I do this with my car in the airport garage. No but wherever I put my card was Such a Good Place that there's No Way I'd EVER forget... I hope so. :/ Holy fuck I never thought of that. Turns out if I press the “TV” button it switches between inputs. Thank you!!

(I still can’t control my TV settings though but this is a godsend!) I do this so I can move the item out of the way to find the car keys I just spent an hour looking for and then forget it anyway as now I’m running late.  
  
I’ve started just actually taking things out and putting them in the car immediately rather than wait until I’m actually going, and it still takes me a couple of tries to remember to take it back out of the car at my destination. But if they're on top, they'll obscure the key and you'll spend an hour trying to find the keys... unless you mean, once you've developed a system for always knowing where you keys are? Next step is to research if universal remotes work on current technology TVs... I haven’t used one in probably almost 20 years—jesus I’m old— but I know they’re still around, I’ve seen them in stores. Yes. It does require you to have exactly one place where your keys belong so you can always find them.
