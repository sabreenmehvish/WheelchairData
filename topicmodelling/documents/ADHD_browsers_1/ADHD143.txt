Untangling ADHD/Depression overlap in eval/diagnostic stage I have an appt with a psych in a few days and am seeking input on how to approach it based on my situation.  I share my story to provide context for the input I’m seeking—and, yes, I wanted to get this off my chest too.  You can skip my story and go straight to the TLDR at the bottom.   

ADHD was never on my radar until two weeks ago—when two of my wife’s friends suggested (separately) that we consider the possibility—both friends are professionally familiar with ADHD.  After some initial research, I experienced the epiphany that so many people here have mentioned.  Identifying with so many symptoms was profound. That brought me here where I’ve been lurking for weeks, finding validation and inspiration in the vivid relatability of your stories/experiences. 

**Depression**

I’m in my early 30’s and have been moderately to severely depressed since age 19.  I’ve come to perceive every destructive behavior and struggle of mine as further proof of my general inadequacy and inferiority as a human being.  My guilt and shame run deep.  For my entire adult life, depression was the dominant theme and only possible “explanation” I considered for how my life ended up like this.  Yet, depression has always felt like an excuse to cover up for the fact that I’m just a piece of shit.  Only an evil, lazy, selfish, disgusting person could have behaved the way I have:

•	**Failed out of college** several times.  Wasted thousands of parents’ money on tuition.  Lied to my family and wife about attending class and grades. I have failed dozens of college courses—mostly for ghosting mid-semester. Aside: I was an all-league college athlete and set records as a freshman—and then was ruled academically ineligible.  It was a big blow and I never recovered.

•	I’ve been **fired twice** (one for an impulsive, illegal act & the other for being disorganized, behind, and hiding it.)

•	**Underperformed in jobs** I wasn’t fired from.  I’ve basically had my dream job for 4 years now and find new ways to fuck up all the time—mostly due to flaky communication and lack of motivation, organization, and follow through.  

•	Completely **unreliable**, lack integrity, very little follow through on my words—my wife is so sick of good intentions and empty promises.  

•	I’m a sorry excuse for a husband (really, I actually am).  Our marriage is on life support.  She doesn’t trust me with small tasks (chores, errands) and certainly not large tasks.  I’m reading through “Is it You, Me, or Adult ADD?” and those dynamics have infected and now dominate our marriage—we are textbook.  I’m slowly killed our marriage via death by a thousand cuts, and she is ready to pull the plug.    

•	I am a HORRIBLE communicator (text, email, phone).  People on this sub talk a lot about forgetting to write back—I do that too, but what I’m most ashamed of is that I am mostly aware when I flake out, and I just consciously put it off.  I procrastinate on answering even basic text messages, and of course the complex ones.  I even ignore work emails/texts for days at a time—knowing the risk/stupidity.  The toll it takes on my soul and my self-worth is crippling—yet somehow not enough for me to change.

•	I’m terrible at maintaining friendships—they have to do all the work.  I rarely initiate contact and sometimes ignore their attempts to contact me.  I like them and I still do this.  

•	**I lack empathy**.  I act and think selfishly…and then don’t do anything about it.  My wife says I use people and I’m afraid I’m too selfish to fully comprehend all the ways she means.  I must be a real prick. 
 
•	**I lie constantly** to people very close to me.  Lying is my most worrying and destructive habit.  I think I developed it as a kid to avoid shame/embarrassment.  It went unchecked and is an uncontrollable beast now.  I’m so ashamed of my dishonesty.  I lie about completing tasks, thinking I’ll do them soon.  Then I don’t, and I get caught in my lie.  I lie about how I spend my time to avoid being seen as lazy.  I lie to keep my inadequacy and unproductiveness in the dark.  Yet lying only exacerbates every bad thing in my life because I’m so disorganized and forgetful that virtually all my lies surface…yet I haven’t kicked the habit.

•	I’ve built **self-destructive habits and unhealthy coping strategies** into every corner of my life.  I’ve locked myself into a strait jacket of my own mind’s design.  Things could change at any time—I realize that—but they don’t.  I don’t do enough to change my circumstances.  Bursts of action and bliss occur, but expire quickly, and end with a bigger step back then I took forward.  

•	**Poor hygiene**.  I neglect toothcare frequently and they are in terrible shape and need work—but I won’t make an appointment.  Showering and shaving is a chore.

•	Self-medicated as a pothead for about 10 years—changed that behavior though!  But only because my wife would leave me if I did it again.

•	**Extreme fatigue**  I would sleep 14 hours a night if I was allowed.  I could take a 3 hour nap at any point throughout the day...if I was allowed.  



**ADHD/Depression Gray Area**

It doesn’t take a psychiatrist to determine that depression has had a big impact on my life.  The above issues are serious and most fall within the depression profile.  I intentionally omitted my ADHD-leaning symptoms, which are listed below.  I did that to try to untangle the symptoms in an unscientific manner, but also to illustrate that the above story is all I had to work with until recently.   

Only in the last few weeks, after learning of ADHD (beyond surface level stigma), have I considered that my depression may have been initially caused by ADHD, and from there I developed several unhealthy coping mechanisms that only got more serious and destructive over time.  It’s easy for me to see how the depression and its accompanying issues masked the ADHD, making it harder to spot.  I don’t blame all my issues on depression—quite the opposite.  I’ve just let my mind run wild building barriers between me and a better life.    I often feel like I’m staring the consequences of my inaction in the face—and I just don’t have the grit to do the right thing.  It feels like I’m simply choosing not to do what I know is right, and my consciousness of “the right thing” only makes me feel evil and despicable for ignoring it.  And that’s why it’s been easy for me to dismiss depression as a cause for my behavior—what if I was just a piece of shit?  Isn’t it possible to be depressed simply because you’re a bad person?

For as long as I can remember (elementary school), I knew I was different—**inadequate, unworthy, not meant for good things**.  In elementary school, I skated by undetected and untroubled—no grit or planning was required.  Around 5th grade I started **procrastinating large projects, not turning in assignments (even if complete/mostly complete)**.  I was ruled academically ineligible for sports as a 6th grader due to missed/late assignments.  I remember countless conversations with my parents about my poor performance and how if I would **“just apply myself”** that I would find it wasn’t so hard.  This continued throughout middle school and into high school.  Those inadequate feelings grew stronger throughout school.

High school was when it got weird for me because I survived in school (underperforming at a level nowhere near my potential), felt fine about my social life, and generally had nothing to complain about.  Yet the thought that I was a fraud and time was ticking persisted—and the voice was getting louder.  Lots of people saw their own successful/healthy version of me, full of potential and charisma— yet I secretly knew all along my world would come crashing down.  It was a matter of when, not if.  Only I knew the “real me,” the dark one, that wasn’t like everyone else—and feared/knew that I would never live up to anyone’s idea of who I was.  And once people saw that side of me—they would lose all interest/faith/respect for me. The weight of that imminent feeling of doom grew as time went on—and carrying that burden while maintaining the smoke and mirrors act was exhausting.  Eventually, I proved myself right.


**ADHD approach**

Reframing my issues in the context of ADHD was a welcome curveball.   I have always felt like someone half-assed putting together my body and soul in the assembly line (missing parts, crossed wires, incompatible software).  That’s how I explain my feeling that I am incomplete and inadequate—I lack the required hardware/infrastructure to be normal.  I think that’s why that feeling of inevitable failure and chaos persisted throughout all my years of CBT—I was set up for failure.  I am the problem, so how could I be the answer?  Depression was my destiny.

It is much easier to comprehend the behaviors/outcomes in my life when viewed through an ADHD lense—as developmental problems in the chemistry of the brain’s management system.  Again, I’m completely depressed—but I’m starting to see how that could be as a result of my inability to perform executive functions at a level that society expects from me.  I remember the presence of ADHD symptoms coming almost 10 years before my first depression symptoms.  

**ADHD-leaning symptoms:**

•	**Severe executive dysfunction**—On the rare occasion that I plan my day with a list of action items—I start on one and barely get anywhere before I’m distracted by a thought, a different browser tab, or get bored with that task and switch to another item on my list.  I bounce from task to task completing 1% of them at a time.  I’ll “take a break” to try and refocus, but then I end up hyper-focusing on a game or article I’m really interested in—before I know it hours have passed and I haven’t crossed one thing off my list.  

•	**Un-started projects**—I put off starting easy projects because they are usually boring and can be done easily at a later time.  I avoid starting complex projects because I get overwhelmed at the thought of organizing an action plan.  If I develop an action plan, I feel bored, if bound by it and avoid starting.

•	**Unfinished projects**—I have 5+ projects around the house that are partially finished (bedroom paint, bathroom backsplash, patio pavers, etc.)  “When a man says he’ll do something, he’ll do it.  No need to remind him every six months.”  I’m so ashamed of my lack of follow through, but the thought of putting in the work to complete the projects is daunting.  

•	**Trouble in school as a kid** (documented above)

•	**Paralysis/inaction**—Starting my days off right is almost impossible.  I seek a pleasure-inducing activity (browse, game, TV) and find it impossible to cut myself off—no matter what obligations and deadlines loom over me.  I can focus for hours on things I’m interested in, and cannot focus for more than 2 minutes on something uninteresting or required of me.  

•	I’m **impulsive**, particularly with risky/destructive behavior.  If I want it, I do it, and often without thinking.  My wife doesn’t believe this “black out” stage can happen right before doing something that betrays her trust.  I can’t explain the emptiness that often occupies my mind right before engaging in impulsive behaviors.  And to be fair, sometimes I am conscious and deflect the “you know better” thoughts to the back of my brain.  I often choose pleasure over joy.  I seek out a temporary feel good activity/behavior instead of a longer-lasting behavior that fosters fulfillment and growth.   

•	**Debilitating forgetfulness**.  I forget instructions/requests as quickly as their given.  I frequently leave the house and return home after a few blocks because I forgot a critical item.

•	**Bouncy thoughts**—I follow my scatterbrain across 5 different thought experiments within a matter of seconds.  Each one engaging and interesting, but not lasting long enough to remember/mark down anything of note.  I can rarely recall what I was talking or thinking about even a few seconds prior. I can’t stay on topic even in my own mind, let alone when someone is talking to me.  For a long time, I thought it was normal to only catch about 60% of what someone was saying.

•	**Fake listening**—I always thought my auto-pilot listening was normal until the last few years.  I notice peers/colleagues engaging deeply in extremely boring conversations that I checked out of long before, and I wonder how they do it.  Entertaining small talk is a chore that is frequently required in my job.  I thought I was good at it—but I’m either getting worse at it or just catching on that people are aware of my inattention.  

•	First impression guru—all downhill from there—does anyone else find themselves sincerely engaged in people they meet, only to lose interest soon after?  Strangers experience the best version of me but soon find out I’m flakey/unreliable/not what they thought.  Same with romantic relationships when I was younger—all about the early chase and then I would sometimes ghost.

•	**Crippled by shame** from undelivered promises, the failure to act on good intentions and to execute even the simplest obvious gestures to support/love those around me.  

•	**No sense of self**.  People talk about knowing themselves and how much that can help them find fulfillment—I have no idea who I am.  People also talk about accepting themselves as they are.  **I am unacceptable**.  And the fact that I allow myself to live this way is only proof that {insert undeserving, shameful pity-party here}.

•	**Hyper-focus**—I quickly enter “flow state” when immersed in activities I’m interested in.  I’ve put off writing this post for about a week, and then started writing at 10pm last night—I’ve now spent 6+ hours on this body of text (good grief).

•	Intelligence and creativity held hostage by executive dysfunction. 

•	There’s the 9 traits and the 6 out of 9 rule—with the requirement that they negatively impact one’s life to a substantial degree—I cannot overstate the degree to which these deficiencies have aided in ruining my life (I’ve done the heavy lifting myself).

Huge thanks to those of you who read my back story.  Please jump to conclusion below TLDR.  

**TLDR** 

I recently discovered that I may be ADHD PI and have my first psych appointment in 2 days.  
I believe the chicken/egg nature of ADHD/depression starts with ADHD for me.  Depression has been the dominant theme in my adult life and masked my ADHD symptoms.  As a kid in school, I overcame ADHD symptoms, skating by on intellect with a bare minimum attitude—undetected and untroubled—very little grit or planning was required.   Flunked out of college at age 19 (when depression started) and several times since.  I’ve treated my depression unsuccessfully with CBT and anti-depressants on and off for 10+ years.   I’ve lost all belief in my self-motivated “restarts” and am eager to see if medication can point me in the right direction.

**Seeking Input**

Now just to approach my evaluation/diagnosis process the right way…I’ve read the frustrating posts of others in their diagnostic process and I’m apprehensive going into my first psych visit.
I know each situation is different based on the individual, the doctor, and other circumstances—but I’m hoping to get some insight from those who’ve been in a similar position in navigating the depression/adhd gray area during the evaluation/diagnosis period.

1.	How can I illustrate/isolate my ADHD symptoms so that they are not just lumped in and blamed on depression?  
2.	How can I do so without appearing as if I’m tiptoeing around depression?  I’m not afraid of talking about depression—I’m afraid that it’s all my psych will want to discuss and treat.
3.	I’m also hesitant to bring up ADHD at all because of the stigma around both self-diagnosis and stimulant-seeking recreational users.  I'm wary of this because technically I self-diagnosed (I'm trying to stay open-minded) and I also just happen to think I am a great candidate for medication.

I’m putting a lot of thought into this because 1) I’ve read your accounts of how unsatisfying and frustrating the process can be, especially compared to needs/expectations and 2) I desperately need this session to be productive my marriage is on its deathbed and my wife is ready to pull the plug—this ADHD exploration is our last hope.  I know I can’t force my desired outcome onto my doc and need to be patient.  I understand it will be a long road regardless of what happens—but I am concerned about starting the journey pointed in the right direction.  I am going to the appointment alone, and I don’t trust myself to articulate my concerns, stay on topic, and ask the right questions to set me up for success.  

Your attention and input is much appreciated, thanks. I have some experience with the mix of depression and adhd. I actually had my adhd diagnosed when getting treatment for depression. I guess I was lucky that my psychiatrist noticed the overlap.

Now as for the input you ask, here's what I'd try to do:

  1. maybe start telling about the symptoms you remember being present since childhood? then link them with things that have happened through adulthood as well. this is a big part of adhd diagnosis (as you seem to know well). your doctor should ask you this as well.
  2. be clear about the treatments you tried for your depression, and that nothing was really satisfactory. talk about the things those treatment worked for, and what they couldn't solve.
  3. talk about your worries. be honest that you're afraid of looking like a recreational junkie and that you're willing to start with non stimulants first (if you are willing to do that, of course!)

It might also be a good idea to write about the things you want to bring up, and maybe come up with some bullet points to bring with when you go to the doctor. Still better than bullshit Kim K pics. I think that it would be helpful to write down a bullet list of points that you would like to discuss to your doctor. Mention the depression and how you feel about it - 
 the doctor may be able to help point out what may be causing it or what can help.

I think that your emotional distress is enough to convince the doctor that you are earnest in receiving treatment.
