How do I know whether I truly dislike my job or it's just mental illness giving me false perception? Been fired or did quit few engineering jobs so far and seeing contract terminated always gave me good feeling and a relief. Otherwise for the whole day I am looking on a watch for that 5PM so I can go home, I pretend that I am working, it takes a lot of mental effort to start tasks (depending on mood - sometimes I even can't open email), while finishing them is like trying to move a mountain, I'm not interested in interacting with coworkers especially talking about work...in short I am like some tourist visiting a company with a very poor productivity. So far I was diagnosed with depression to a high extend, and with ADD to a lower extend.

The 1 million dollar question: Do I truly dislike my profession or it's just false perception due to mental illness?

EDIT: I am not taking meds (yet), but I was prescribed Venlafaxin. I have this as a last line of defense.

EDIT2: Some more info for you guys (sorry if sounds a bit techy, as it was written for techies on first place):

>Since my electronics engineering studies and even since my technical high school days, deep down in me I am asking myself, whether electrical engineering (or software development tasks - it's pretty much the same thing due to problem solving nature) is really something that I want to do, leaving a good pay, market demand and social status aside? High school was somewhat terrible, while university was more bearable as I wasn't forced in doing anything and everything was very individual. Uni was hard and at the same time a complete boredom, but somehow, with a lot of luck, I managed to pass it by doing learning campaigns few days before exams while having a lot of help from colleagues. Of course, the grades were an utter garbage, but at the end of the day the boat was floating, although there were some close calls to drop out the uni (as a side note, I live in a social country with "free" education, so fooling around in school is possible without ending with a big dept). During practice work on uni, professors occasionally caught me being mentally absent, and had advised me that it's better for me to go for a walk in a park rather than daydreaming during their lessons. Few times assistants warned me that in essence I don't have the capability to perform engineering tasks, while other colleges told me in face or behind by back that I am a dumb moron. They might be right, but at the same time it makes me wonder, if that's true, how the hell did I make it so far - it can not be all luck, or is it?

>Now the job. The best part of it is going home and often it takes an eternity in waiting for that 5 o'clock. I can barely start tasks, and finishing them is a major challenge. Often I just pretend that I am working or I keep doing some completely irrelevant tasks. My productivity is low and my manager already warned me about it. Then I am not interested in talking with coworkers, especially not about work-related topics. On team meetings I have very hard time to stay on focus with discussion, usually I just sail away with my thoughts. On few occasions I've heard from coworkers that "this guy is a dumbass", "he doesn't know what he is talking about" I was said straight in face that "we need to have someone who CAN think" so there has to be something about all this stuff. I think that so far I excelled only in simple linear scripting (e.g. programming steps for automation), but I usually got lost in anything more complex that requires an actual problem solving. I never finished any app design. Some employer even suggested me, to maybe consider graphic design. So far I had quit or been fired at few jobs, all in the engineering field, and every contract termination made me happy. Not sure if I ever got any interest in any of those jobs, aside from money and status.

>And then my hobby, which should be game development. I yet have to finish a single game, because I've only ended with dozens of half working prototypes. When I am developing a game, I tend to somehow get stuck in coding. Often I just keep staring in that code for a longer time, not moving anywhere. Finally, I somehow stop coding and end with doing graphical work, composing music, googling or playing around with tabs in browser...in short, I end doing some irrelevant stuff instead of continuing with game development. I believe that from all the tasks that I can do, programming takes me the most of time (too much of it) and brings no results.

&#x200B; I get a job and like it for a bit then get bored and want to leave. Where I'm at now allows me to listen to music while I work which is great and the job is easy. Yet sometimes I still get the urge to leave Or both? Something that really struck me was when you said you have no interest in interacting with coworkers, especially talking about work.  This has happened to me a few times and is usually the biggest sign that I really hate my job.  Usually if I have a good friendship with someone at work or at least a good rapport with my coworkers I can find enough motivation to come in and be fairly productive.  If not, that usually means it's time for me to move on.

Obviously I don't know much about your personality but just my two cents is that if you don't like the people you work with (and/or work for), it makes everything else harder. >I get a job and like it for a bit then get bored and want to leave

Pretty much a story of my life. Unfortunately it also applies to my hobbies, as I am master at creating stuff, but also a master at not finishing anything. A curse.
