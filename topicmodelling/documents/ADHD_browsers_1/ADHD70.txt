What smartphone/PC software do you use to map out your tasks and remember things? I'm 6 months into treatment (age 32), and life has never been better.  I am so productive, especially on the weekends.  I love the weekends.  For the first time in my life I have the energy and ability to get things done.

On the weekends I have a printed daily template that I use to set tasks and activities for myself (made in Excel), chrck items off as I do them, and get a great sense of accomplishment when reviewing what I was able to achieve in a single day.  Items could be simple things such as:  Wash Dishes, organize Dropbox folders, Grocery Shopping, Purchase Bluetooth headset, etc.

During the week I use no such list, and have relied on emailing myself whenever I have an idea of something I need to do over the weekend.  It is incredibly clunky, and I need a better method ti handle this.  

Does anyone have a suggestion for me?  Pardon my typos - on mobile  Evernote is great with this. It syncs with your other devices too, so you can create a note in Evernote (or multiple notes, depending on whether you like to put everything on one or organize a certain way) and it'll sync to your computer. You could then add to your spreadsheet.


Another option would be to download the Google Drive app and create a spreadsheet on there. You could make the spreadsheet in Google Drive so you can essentially just add to your weekend spreadsheet from your phone while on the go. I use the following:

Google Calendar - maps out important dates with multiple reminders

Tick Tick - Awesome to-do list you can install it on your browser and mobile (android not sure about iphone)

Inkpad Notepad - Whenever I need to jot down notes you can access it on your browser or download it on your phone (also android not sure about iphone)

Google Drive: Perfect to quickly sync files from my work computer, home computer, phone and school laptop.  deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8933  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/15713) I use a combo of HabitBull, Evernote, and Sunrise Calendar.  I use the wunderlist app, it can be shared with others and can do so much it is incredibly helpful There are many to-do apps. Some friends of mine actually recently released "[Accomplish](http://www.accomplish-software.com/)", an Android app designed to be an intuitive to-do day planner; you should check it out, it might just be what you need. I like Google Inbox because I can snooze emails & create reminders. I have a problem where if I don't do something immediately, it probably won't get done. Being able to snooze the email and have it pop up in my inbox when I actually need to do the task "tricks me" into thinking that it's actually a new task.

You can also create reminders that aren't attached to an email. If you think of something to do over the weekend, you can create a reminder and then snooze it until Saturday (or whenever), and it will pop up just like a new email in your inbox.

I like it better than iPhone reminders because it's integrated into my email. I have a hard time sticking to one solution (ESPECIALLY when it seems to be working really well for me... my life is some kind of cosmic joke), but here's what I do:

* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) for complicated task / project management. It's a Mac and iPhone app. [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com) is good cross-platform alternative.
* A little flip notebook that I keep in my pocket at all times to quickly jot down notes and tasks before they're flushed out of my brain's short term memory (like one of those notebooks that policemen and journalists use in the movies). Pretty sure it's a Moleskine [like this](http://www.moleskine.com/Products-portlet/image?id=756). I like that the cover is pretty durable, so the pages have a solid writing surface whenever I go to jot something down. (Don't put it in the butt pockets of your pants though... mine has suffered from a [bendgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_6#Chassis_bending) of sorts). I jokingly refer to it as my external [hippocampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus).
* Heavy use of my Google Calendar for scheduling, to help make sure I actually get things done when I say I will.

Hope this helps!
