Advice to learn meditation techniques i have seen a lot of people talk highly about meditation on here as a way to help with concentration and stress.

anyone who's tired it want to link me to the best way they found to learn or possibly their favorite type of meditation / video.

Right now i'm STRESSED out of my eye balls and constration is dripping out of my skin quicker than sweat and i'm up for anything trying anything to help right now lol  If you're stressed out of your eye balls and thereby not up to reading or watching anything requiring a lot of attention, I'd recommend trying this breathing technique out, even though it's not *exactly* a meditation technique. You can certainly indulge in this technique before initiating a number of meditative (or, more directly, stress-undermining) practices, and it arguably takes less time to benefit from the stress-relief of this technique than from the stress-relief of most novice meditative advisements.

Asleep in 60 seconds: 4-7-8 breathing technique claims to help you nod off in just a minute

While the video's title indicates that the technique can help you "nod off" within a minute, I'd recommend using the technique simply to undermine your stress levels.

Here's another (and funny) resource you can use if you have 2 minutes and 29 seconds to spare & a good pair of headphones with which to shield people in your environment from the vulgar content of this video:

Here are some additional resources with which to undermine your stress levels -- although, as a warning, not all of these are going to be easily or quickly understood, so resist clicking on them until you've handled your major obligations:

(if you click the little square in the upper-right of this webpage, you'll be able to customize your breathing exercises. If you're in an exceptionally stressed out *phase* of life, rather than just a really stressed out *instance* in your life, you might profit by bookmarking the Xhalr page and making it your internet browser's home page -- having access to a stress-reduction device which appears in your visual field might help you a lot more than a meditative practice which simply enters and leaves your memory).

Gravity Position - How to make 5 hours of sleep feel like 8.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lispOvdHNWY

I don't have any solid information with which to bolster the title's claim that this technique will help you "make 5 hours of sleep feel like 8," but the benefit of trying the technique out is that unless you're **extremely** pressed for time in each night during which you try the gravity position, the technique is only trivially taxing to attempt.

Given you're really stressed out and might not be up to the task of reading something more lengthy than a few lines, this link might not be easily approached or digested until you're rested and/or have access to medication, but I share it for your immediate storage and future use -- *instantly set an alarm up in your life so you actually go back to this link and read it*.

(This one isn't a practice or experiment or technique, it's a product you can ingest, but it's a bonus bit of information).

(*This doesn't work for everyone, and you'd probably be better off sampling the free and easily attempted resources people recommend than you'd be experimenting with different purchases, but*) I've found Natural Vitality's "Natural Calm" Magnesium to potently reduce stress when no other techniques or tools seem to do the trick.

That's all for now. I hope the first resource helps you enough to undermine your stress levels.

If the intro is too long scroll down to the part where it's titled, "Deep Breathing" I tried many different ways, different apps, mindfullness trainings and everything. Nothing ever sticked because somehow I felt really uncomfortable having to think about my left toe, the my right one etc. It felt like it was a load of crap with all this "let everything go with your next breath" kind of stuff. + it takes so looong (yes 10 mins is long for me). 

Then I found an app called simple habit, which has a one week meditation crash course of only 5 mins a day! It is made especially for people like me who don't like all the hippy things that normally seem to surround all meditation practices. Somehow it worked and I have been meditating every day since a month or so. I don't really notice any long-term effects yet, but it really calms my mind the moment I meditate, which is already a huge win for me.  The UCLA meditation podcasts changed my life. They are recordings of live sessions in a room full of people so they don't feel over produced or dramatic. The woman who facilitates the sessions is funny and humble and kind and real. They are a half hour long - I would suggest using the recordings once or twice a week and then on other days just use a timer for shorter periods if necessary. Good luck!
