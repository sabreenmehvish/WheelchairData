[Information Overload] Do you have trouble keeping track of the mounting tabs / links / notification msgs on your browser? It's a non-stop hamster wheel. I usually have 10~20 tabs open on my browser, 
Youtube links, blog links.. pertaining to different topics (ie: Self-help, philosophy, programming, job search)

I **bombard myself with information overload** and my brain's constantly searching and being distracted.

Another big one is I'm having real trouble keeping up with the all the saved posts and messages I need to respond to on Reddit.

There're private message that deserve my response but I can't track them down..

interesting saved posts that need to be read but I barely skim through and my attention gets pushed onto the next one.

**It's like a time interval at a bus stop.** My attention / thought comes and leaves every 3~5 minutes.

It's "on schedule." I can't stop the resetting thought train. It's like my brain's on autopilot.

I can't be fully engaged to finish one long read / watch.

It's a **colossal mental block** whenever I get down to do anything, work or play.

Is this something ADD / ADHD patients suffer from?

What do you think of my symptoms? It's pretty severe.


TL;DR: Severe inability to focus on a task. Always end up opening 10~20 tabs on browser & have tons of PMs, saved posts on Reddit I can't track. **My focus seems to reset / shift every 5 minutes on the clock like a bus stop.** I have so many tabs open on my phone browser that it stopped counting and just shows infinity.

I have the opposite attention problem though - I can't shift my attention no matter how badly I need a break.

Even getting up is a problem because it involves shifting out of sleep mode and so on.  I've never had this problem, probably because I know how bad it would be if I let it get out of control. I obsessively close unused tabs and start to feel anxious any time I have more than three or four open. Only 10-20? I usually have 2 or 3 different chrome windows open with 10-50 tabs in each. I just went through to "clean" it out by bookmarking things for later and I still have 25 or so tabs. 
My tablet probably has 60 tabs open...and my phone has 95 right now.
 fun fact: it stops showing the number count at 100+). 

I'm also really afraid of losing all my tabs. 

Note: not diagnosed, waiting for appointment for doctor.  > I can't shift my attention no matter how badly I need a break.

Do you mean your mind gets fixated on the (entertainment) content that gives you that dopamine rush?

> I have so many tabs open on my phone browser that it stopped counting 

Yeah, pretty much the same here.

I get excited when presented with new info but I can't finish the content before being dragged to the next interesting one.

Is this a sign of ADHD?  > Only 10-20?

Actually more than that sometimes. I'm in the similar ballpark as you. (15~30?)

> I'm also really afraid of losing all my tabs.

Yes.. it's almost like I'm hoarding bits of data.

and my focus gets dispersed at the sight of the sheer number of tabs open on Chrome. (My mind's constantly shifting from one to next.)

It gets very inrritating & almost painful..

Do you get agitated like that also? I do what I can to avoid "entertainment content" - no TV, no consoles, no home internet and my data switches to 2g after 5 GB. The mobile games on my phone all stop you from playing too much with some kind of real time energy system  Exactly! Hoarding. It's all very valuable info that I don't want to lose. Items from shopping sites, fanfics/webnovels/books to read or to save the spot I left off at... actually looking through like 90% of these tabs are for fanfics... but I hate hitting the favorite button because you can't easily see what the story is about unless you load another page. 


Idk about attention shifting from one to the next, it is what it's always been.
