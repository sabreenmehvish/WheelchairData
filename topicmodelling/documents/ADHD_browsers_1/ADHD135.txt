[Approved Academic Study] Memory and concentration in ADHD (Worldwide, 18+, diagnosed with ADHD) We are conducting a research project for the University of Wollongong requiring participants with ADHD and would love it if anyone here would be able to or would be willing to get involved. All participation is entirely voluntary and the project has approval from an ethics board :)

**What is it?**
We are interested in investigating how people with adult ADHD perform on computerised tasks measuring aspects of memory, concentration and attention. We will compare performance in these tasks between groups of people with adult ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and people without a mental health diagnosis. We hope to find out more about which aspects of these types of thinking differ between these different clinical conditions, which help to better understand, assess and treat them in the future.

**What does the study involve?**

We are looking for:

* Male or female participants

* We are at least 18 years old

* Who have had a diagnosis of adult ADHD from a health care professional and who are currently experiencing symptoms of ADHD

* Who do not have another mental health diagnosis (e.g. depression, psychosis, substance use disorder or OCD) 

* Who have not taken stimulant medication in the last 12 hours 

If you choose to participate in the study, you will be asked to:

* Complete online questions about you, your general health, and psychological symptoms (e.g. ADHD, anxiety and depression).

* Complete some online tasks which measure aspects of your attention and memory. These tasks need to be completed on a laptop or computer **not** a tablet or phone.

Participation should take no more than 60 minutes and is anonymous (your name will not be asked). You are welcome to take breaks in between tasks (just leave your browser open!). Please ensure you read the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form prior to starting.
