My newest internet productivity trick I set my browser launch page to my Google Docs folders (which I need for work). Now that's the first thing I see, instead of news/email/other distractions. Of course I still popped over here to share this, but... I use memrise for mine! I study off of PDF files so don’t need to open them in chrome, but I looove memrise. I set my focus for the day in the morning so by the time I’m back from work it’s there waiting for me. 

Another good tip if you are able to is to fully shut down your computer every time you stop using it, or at least close all of the programs. I find that I get much less distracted because yknow those YouTube tabs aren’t open already. I can intentionally not open them so as to not get distracted. 

I also use an app (I paid £4.99 for premium I think) called typography to make really high quality wallpapers that I change weekly to something that will motivate me and make me want to work. I have the same one on my phone and laptop because I like how it matches.  Brilliant strategy! I'm going to set mine to my online classes school page! I didn't know memrise was available on my computer.  I just set it as my homepage.  Now I just have to get in the habit of turning off my computer.
