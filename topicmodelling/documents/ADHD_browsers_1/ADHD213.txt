Out of distractions -- good sign or bad? I generally spend most of my work shifts with about 40 browser tabs open, and I never get to them all.  Then I feel guilty later on when I (a) haven't finished reading all that stuff and (2) haven't done the things I had on my personal to-do list that I meant to do while I was at work.

Tonight however, I haven't been able to come up with hardly anything that I want to research, read about, watch, etc.  I just can't figure out what to do and I am going crazy.

And I felt this way at home earlier too.

So is this...a good sign?  Or should I be worried?  I'm not medicated, by the way.

Incidentally, I just happen to have a job where I am monitoring and responding to things that are happening, but in between events there is a minute of downtime here, two minutes there, and I just occupy my time as stated above.
