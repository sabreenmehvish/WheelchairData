Preliminarily diagnosed with ADHD, withdrew from college on medical leave, full neuropsychological panel scheduled a couple days from now. In the meantime, here's a visual representation of my mental state :P (laptop screenshot).  Woah woah woah tabs man.

I do that number of tabs, but I usually split them among ~ three browser windows (I have dual monitors) that are *semi* categorized :P  I loved the insane amount of reddit tabs on there haha.  I'm one to talk... I have 8 tabs open myself at the moment.  And it is 8 AM my time! and then you forget all about these tabs and quit your browser when you finish reading the last you opened, to re-open them all back +some new one, repeat this all night.

Also in mine, half are usualy just double because i forgot i already opened the page in another tab... Crazy multi tabber here as well. Chrome is the only browser that seems to keep up with me.  Do I spy a WWLTV icon? I do this too.  Window for whatever I am SUPPOSED to be doing, window for things to go through later, window for current activities.  yup! I thought so.  Good luck on your college situation.  I took 3 semesters off to work on my own personal problems before returning to college and kicking ass.  Just keep moving forward. 

And close some tabs.  That's just ridiculous.  Thank you!  

Narrowed it down to four >:D (edit: four as in four tabs. haha)
