Any scientific study correlating tabs browsers and frequency of opening (or navigating through internet) with aDhD ? I read here https://redd.it/33kbp8 and would like to know if there is any measure or research that correlated attention in browsing with ADHD, and also if attention in browsing reflects to real life or is just a syntom of the body asking for "please stop watching the screen". I donÂ´t know, but it is consistent with the very ADHD behavior of being afraid to put anything away that you might be using in the near future.
