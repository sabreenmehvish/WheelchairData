My Favorite ADHD Game - Do you have any? Do you guys have any "ADHD games" you play on a regular basis? I'll share one of mine! 

Okay - so, when I was little, I invented this game that I would play to entertain myself...I now call it "**How the hell did I get here?**" I've tried to explain it to people before, but I'm thinking it might be sponsored by ADHD, so I thought I'd share with you all! 

Here's how you play "How the Hell Did I Get Here?": 
----------------------------------------------------------------
*Step 1*: **Zone out - this part is usually involuntary**; I tend to get lost in thought in meetings, during car rides, etc. but I played this game most when I was in school. 

*Step 2*: **Notice that you're thinking of something completely off topic, irrelevant and ridiculous** (example: What you would say to your 3rd grade teacher's daughter if you ever ended up at the same college party)

*Step 3*: **Trace your internal dialogue backwards** to figure out why your brain ended up on this topic; (bonus points if you make it all the way back to Point A) 


It goes something like this.... 
-----------------------------------------
I'm sitting in a work meeting, mentally planning a garden for next spring. I slowly focus my eyes and think "How the hell did I get here?" and the game is on. It's a super entertaining way for me to better understand my spacey brain, and to identify the really cool connections I make and usually let pass by me completely....here's how it usually turns out: 

>Ugh, I'm bored. This meeting is so unrelated to my job. Why am I here? Do I even like my job? Would other jobs be better? It would be amazing to not work inside all the time. I get that humans are safer indoors, but why would we EVER move completely indoors when we benefit from nature so much? I wonder what our society would look like if we spent less time indoors & in cars and more time outside protecting and enjoying the environment? Gah, should I go camping this weekend? Maybe that would help. Maybe I'll go camping. But I could also work on cleaning up my yard to make it a place I wanted to relax in. Or I could start a garden - that would connect me to nature...

 Mine is "why did I come in here again" I always do this! It feels so rewarding when you can re-trace your tangents all the way back to the original thought! “I accomplished something today!” Skyrim. There are a lot of quests and of course the main quest. But you can do them in any order, start them, play through the quests halfway and then start a new one, then continue with the older quest on your way to another new quest. All while exploring and exploring the scenery. Then when you do finish quests it feels good. Been playing for 7 years, still the best game especially for someone with ADHD

EDIT: Realized you didnt mean video games lol oops Any game is ADHD game as long as it helps me procrastinate... Or avoid taking any decision at all  Mine is.

"What did that person just say to me and why do they look like they expect a response?" 

:I I am doing better though. Just sometimes especially in small talk I don't care about (Weather or shit they just bought) I tend to zone out. Then I end up back in the moment with no idea what has happened. I play a game that is called "12:34". Way back I noticed that I often look at a clock at 12:34. I like this time because it's 1,2,3,4...
Now that I know that I have ADHD I guess the reason why I always see this time on the clock is because my eyes move around constantly and I notice so many things.

I play the game with two friends. You have to write 12:34 in the what's app group at exact 12:34. If you manage to do this you win.

[was this comprehensible??? ] 
 I have a little game that I like to call "Where are my pants?" See How Hard You Can Stab Your Head With Open Cupboard Doors

 When I say "I'll start working at 12:45" and put on an alarm it's a fun game to guess how many minutes/hours get added onto the original time. If I start at all. I need to try this  Yea, Breath of the Wild has had me in it's grip for a while now. It's so well designed for exploration, even if you've basically been everywhere already. I don't think I've ever played a game that rewards you so well for picking your own goals and appealing to your sense of curiosity. I'm waiting to fight Ganon until I've finished everything I want to do because I know that the finality of it will squish my enjoyment. Like, I know I'm 160 hours in, have 98% of the shrines, over a third of the Korok seeds, most of my armor is maxed out, and I've got a hot 20k in my pocket, but this DLC has a motorcycle somewhere in it and I'll be *damned* if I save Hyrule without a hog 'tween my legs. 

EDIT: Wait. You mean like situational stuff. Yea me too. I do a lot of arty stuff, so craft stores are like my mecca. I'll go in thinking "Okay, I need razor blades and a gold marker. Lets see how long I take \*check time\*. 20 minutes should be enough." Then I go in, forget that game, and start playing "Lets see what I didn't know I needed until I can't carry it all and have to figure out what I'm actually going to buy." Then I walk out and figure out that I lost the first game. I always win the second, though, so y'know easy come easy go. Very few times do I win, but when I do I stare at the chain of thoughts I've discovered with pride. Like I've finally understood my own creation. Most of mine are just for occupying myself in tedious situations so maybe they're not necessarily ADHD? But I'm quite the master of zoning out so I can hyperfocus on them when needed I guess.
I used to do multiple day hiking trips that would include multiple hours straight of just hiking in silence and to pass the time I would make Top 5 lists of all sorts of categories (at the time it was Love Live songs because I'm a weeb)--like top 5 characters, top 5 scenes, top 5 songs, then I could argue about which should be placed where in my head haha.
Another one when I'm waiting in long lines or walking somewhere is Count The Hot People, where I just count the hot people I see (making sure not to double count anyone on accident). I make a tally once I'm done of men and women and see which were hotter lmao. Mine is "What did you say??"

Turns out others don't like to play as much I like to play word association games with other ADHD people. For example person one might say "music" then person two might say "note" then one says "study" and on and on. Bonus points if you get back to the first word unintentionally. 

I also like to play where is my phone in my bed because I set it down somewhere. Oh I had a good one and wrote it down recently. Someone mentioned on a thread about getting distracted and learning the Akkadian language. I started trying to remember what I could about early civilizations, then I thought about "Christina Alberta's Father" by H.G.Wells because he thinks he's the reincarnation of Sargon II of Babylonia, then I thought about how H.G.Wells is known for his classic sci-fi stories, then I thought how cool Logan's Run is as a classic Sci-fi, which stared Sir Michael York who was great as Ascher Flemming in Gilmore Girls, a show known for it's rapid fire dialogue, the term rapid fire comes from a machine guns fast repeating firing action, Kurt Vonnegut Jr. once described machine guns "like a garden hose, only it sprays death". 

It's not just drifting through abstract connections, it's the fact that this all took place in like a minute that gets me. So it's like we're talking about ancient civilizations, and I start talking about Kurt Vonnegut, and everyone is like what?, and I go Vonnegut-machine gun-Gilmore Girls-Michael York-Logan's Run-H.G.Wells-Sargon II/Babylon so yeah it makes perfect sense. Sigh... For me it's "is it my ADHD or age???" Bonus points for reminding myself to look up signs of early onset dementia. Double bonus points if I still remember the question once I've turned my head.  I do that “how did I get here” game all the time  Mine is What was I doing before you interrupted me? I play this all day long. I do it too. It's horrifying when stoned or drunk. This morning I played "when will this meeting be over?" with a few co-workers. OP I play that game. It’s fun and cool. It helps me practice using my working memory because I have to backtrack.  I like playing how many times do I have to go back into a room before I remember to grab what I went in there for! 

I also often play how many times can I unknowingly interrupt someone in conversations before they call me out on it Wait. Do normal people not do this?? I do mindmaps- on paper. 

Because i dont know where they will end up. And solutions lie there. 

Because i can and its fun. 

Because then i can explain something to someone else when words just dont work. 

Ive done mindmaps for excersise, work flow, holiday plans, clothes. 

Protip: so much better than a pros and cons list for decisionmaking “What’s That Thing Called” is one I play pretty often. E.g. “Hey, what are we going to eat for... shit, that- the thing we eat in the middle of day. What the fuck.” 

“What Have I Done” gives WTTC a run for its money, though. I play it every day but it’s not as fun, and it always follows highly regrettable actions. Like “fixing” the garbage disposal or my glasses, or randomly rearranging all the living room furniture. \*thinks of something while surfing the web*

\*open new browser tab to google the thing*

\*immediately forgets what I wanted to search and stare blankly at screen trying to remember*

--alternatively--

\*opens new browser tab*

\*looks at top of the browser and realizes there's already a google tab for what I wanted to search*

--alternatively--

\*looks at top of browser and sees a long-abandoned tab*

\*opens it*

\*goes down the rabbit hole and immediately forget about whatever it is I wanted to search* I love the how to mitigate the consequences of forgetting insert chore The ADD game I play most often has to be "Just Keep Moving". When I'm in a fog, somehow I simultaneously a. don't want to do anything and b. Judge any work I do accomplish as meaningless and insufficient. By literally chanting "Just Keep Moving" to myself, I can get started on something and feel ok about it 15 or 30 minutes in.  It’s called failing always And wanting to die  I’ve learned backtracking for me means thinking too hard, and thinking too hard means irritability. Does this ever happen to you? I try this game, but it always makes me so mad, for some odd reason. This for me is such an infuriating part of ADHD lmfao. I forget what I’m doing from room to room. Ugh. Yes. I feel like a damned house cat.  Oh, I play this game several times a day.  I win if I can actually remember what it was I was doing.  Bonus points if I remember within the first 2-3 seconds of asking myself why. I got stuck in a feedback loop walking from my room to the kitchen.  “Why did I come to the kitchen, I’ll go back to my room and I’ll remember.”  “Why did I come to my bedroom?  I’m sure the kitchen holds my answer.” Took me walking back and forth at least 10 times before I realized I was stuck 

Yeah I hadn’t even started in either room.  I’d been in the living room watching TV.  Yup. All day every day. Weird but kinda similar phenomenon I’ve been noticing recently: I lose all my memory of a dream as I’m waking up the second I flip over to the other side of my body.  As in, that foggy little bit that lingers the first 30 seconds or so of being awake vanishes. Like I left my memory on the other side of my brain (or the room I just walked out of). 

Through some sort of flawed ADHD neurochemistry, simply changing which side of my head that I’m laying down on completely shakes the etch-a-sketch, and that vague outline of the last moments of my dream instantly evaporates.  Video games totally count. I love Skyrim!  ive played skyrim since release, bought it 4-5 times (havent regretted a single one lol) and have sunk god knows how many hours into it, yet i still havent beaten the Companions, Civil War, or main storylines. i havent even gotten very far into the quest lines, like only 3-4 quests in. i come back to skyrim every 6-8 months for another play through, such a great game. i should play when i get home :D  LOL BIG MOOD Haha I hate it when I ask them something and they answer but as soon as they open their mouths I space out. Then when they finish I realize that I was actually supposed to be listening to them and sheepishly apologize and ask them to repeat what they just said. I always get the same “why did you bother asking if you don’t care enough about my answer” look. Holy shit!!! I have a similar tick, or obsession, or whatever this is. Thank God. I'm not a lunatic. I ALWAYS notice when the numbers 5,3, and 1 are together in my near vicinity. In any order: 135, 153, 531,351, 5-31, etc. Whether it's on a license plate, a clock, a sign, a screen, a cloud formation, in a book- HELL, I even did it just now! Eyes darted to the Safari tab I just opened up my email on because the label displayed "Inbox (5,312)".

I don't play a game or anything, I just notice anytime the numbers are grouped together in any medium or form in my immediate vicinity. Happens at LEAST once a day. It's probably closer to a handful of times a day on average though.

It all started when I was a kid. My Dad told me that the numbers 1,3, and 5 together were good luck- God saying "you're on the right path" as it were. I have no idea where he got this superstition/belief from, but ever since he passed it on to me I started looking for the numbers grouped together on instinct in my daily life. It's like I detect the number pattern unconsciously in my peripheral vision and, since I get a spike of dopamine when I spot them (it being good luck and all), my brain just knows to present it to me. It's honestly incredible to me. My eyes dart to the numbers on license plates all the time when I'm driving, like "Squirrel!"

I've literally never told anyone about this. Is it an ADHD thing? Because your explanation makes so much sense.

Also, to OP, I do that shit every goddamn day and it still shocks me each and every time when I realize my train of thought's gotten away from me. It's like, how is it so undetectable?  It's a similar phenomenon to how you don't pick up on dreams not making any sense.   I've been doing this exact same thing for about 10 years with my friend but at 11:34, not 12:34.  I used to do this with my formerly close friend who also had ADHD. We would do that for 11:11 Also, where are my keys, phone, wallet, water bottle, shoes, passport... Oh lord, this is one I'm familiar with RIGHT? It's so satisfying to find the underlying logic to the chaos haha  YES. That's exactly it - either I'm surprising myself by thinking something so off-topic or I'm really surprising the people I'm talking to by doing a full 180 with no warning....Also, Sir Michael York *was* great as Ascher Flemming!  Unclear. Most of the non-ADHD people I've tried to explain it to seem to understand the concept, but not why it would be entertaining? I think maybe the ridiculousness of the connections for ADHD brains are more fun to trace than more "logical" thought patterns lol This is an amazing idea! It's like a reverse "How the hell did I get here?" haha commenting because this post is clever and got no love. now it's got one mo' love.  Username does not check out faux failure. Winning.  Same!! Sometimes I go aross the hall to my sister's room for something, forget why I'm there, and start chit chatting with her. THE most distracting thing ever lol The statement above is one I can get behind! is that not normal?? I thought it was normal! It's so maddening how everyone can tell funny stories about their weird dreams when I can barely remember what I'd just been thinking of 30 seconds earlier Lmao took me years to complete the game. Play through after play through is complete a little more each time. Usually wouldn’t complete finish every faction. Only once I finished every faction   I am amazed at how my brain so fluidly gives no fucks to what is being said and then drops me back into the conversation lol Damn glasses always on my face where I least expect them! It's definetly in the same realm tho - because at the end i look at the page and laugh and laugh. 

Latest example is using a compass image to prompt excersise..... How the hell did i get there? 

- Put excersise in a circle in the middle of the page 
- random connected thoughts 
- the pathway that made most sense ran crushed down the side 
- ie alignment of all sorts
- expanded that next page 
- ended up with I am statement 
- i am orientating myself to longevity and inteGritty 
- result: banish the word excersise from calanders etc and use compass to start this task. 

Tl; dr So yes, its the opposite/sideways version and also just as crazy fun. :)

Edit to say i freaking Aligned today - did some interval running to orientate myself to my ideals of a good life and happiness. Works for me.  I FEEL SO LOVED IM HAPPYYY Oh yeah it’s definitely worse for us overall. Like our memory retrieval system is uniquely fucked. But even beyond that, I noticed I can hold onto SOMEthing of my dream for at least a few seconds, but lately I’ve discovered that if I flip over even in that few seconds, I forget even faster. Like instantly faster. Like my memory is tied to the physical position of my body/head almost.
