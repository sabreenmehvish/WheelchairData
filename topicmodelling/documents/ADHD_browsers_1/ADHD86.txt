What to do when your ADHD is really acting up and you need to study? Hey, 

I'm attempting to study for a test right now and my ADHD literally will not allow me to do so. I can't focus to save my life, I took my meds today so I should be fine on that part, but I can't seem to wrap my mind around studying.

Music isn't helping either. All of my go to things are failing me right now. I'm in a "study room" on campus where i'm alone, I have my computer open but pushed way to the side and sleep mode on so it won't distract me but I can't seem to study. Exercise can be really helpful. Really get your heart rate up for half an hour or so. Go for a run or vigorous bike ride or whatever. Have a quick shower, a cup of coffee (or your meds), and settle in for a good study session. I'm not trying to be mean or belittle you in my suggestions. I am simply telling you what works for me. 

1. **Turn off the internet**, if you turn it off, then you'll have to wait for it to start up again, by waiting you will have time to stop yourself. 

2. **White noise**. Chills the brain, blocks out everything. Play it loud. 

3. **Walk around** if you need too. Remember it's okay to take breaks. 

4. Take it **one topic at a time.** If you have several chapters to cover, take each chapter and separate it into bite-sized topics. 
 Aim for five minutes of productivity for every 15.  Once you know you can do this it will get easier.

Good luck.  Been down that road.  NOW GET OFF REDDIT! honestly.. I'd put it down and do something else for awhile. go get a pizza with your buds, maybe you'll be able to focus on it later. But hey, don't listen to me, I have ADHD too ;) If you've got any, pop a Ritalin (or other short-acting med of choice). Lower the temperature (open a window, turn on a fan). No TV/webz/other crap. Drink a lot of water (keeps making you get up to piss). You might try moving.  Being in a slightly strange place, for me, helps me study.  I get nothing done in my room, so I moved to my dorm's lounge.  That started to get routine, so I moved to my friend's apartment.  I also started going to the computer lab, and various places in the library.  It's worth a shot. I did two years of undergraduate engineering without ADHD meds. It was a fucking terrible experience. 

I learned that the only things that really helped were working in groups. That way, there is external pressure to keep focusing on the material. 

Also, just be around people in general. Personally, whenever I found myself alone tryign to study, it was game over.  ADHD means we have a problem with our self regulation, which means its really hard to get started. 
So you know how you get that really "pro-active" or "do something" feeling when you take a tablet, just like use that to write a quick checklist or something. Checklists are alright because they are short term. (I've never completed one though, after ticking off the first few I like forget about it.) 
But still, getting started or having like an idea where to start is pretty helpful.
So maybe breaking a huge task down into little steps takes away that overwhelming "I don't know where to start" feeling. 
 How do you "turn off the internet" as so many suggestions go, when you NEED the internet to study.  Wikipedia and journal databases, for instance?

Strangely enough, white noise distracts me.  I never could figure out how people liked it. This is what I've figured out over the years too. I have to listen to the brown noise generator on simplynoise to get anything done 
 NOoooo no no. XD sounds familiar.... I find procrastination kind of forces this full on adrenaline rush/panic cram session. Actual effectiveness of this may vary :P Studying in varying locations also helps your brain cement what you are learning in your mind (there has been research about this).  I try to at least change the room I'm in and turn on/off music every hour but at best change my location more dramatically every hour.   If you can't turn off the internet, you can at least turn off facebook/reddit/myspace/etc. 

I know many browsers have apps built into the browser in order to block certain websites for certain amounts of time.  same, can't stand it unless i have no option but to shut everyone and everything off to stop from being distracted. 
Also, i study with books, why internet? honest question There is a calvin and hobbes related to that... But isn't there always? Heh, I think I've downloaded one, but idk if I ever set it up.  =P As I said, wikipedia and databases...reference sites.  No way I can have all the refs I need around, and even in a library, I'd get up to find something...and wander down the rabbit hole. Don't worry...i have two installed and most of the time i forget to turn them on until it's to late.  uhm, it helped me to talk to a counselor and build a habit of studying better, there's a subreddit called r/getstudying i think, also talk to a doctor to get medicated, idk man, been there and its difficult to come out of that hole. 
U don't have books for your classess?  I have books...to some extent.  Sometimes I need a refresher on more basic classes and it's faster and easier to wiki it.  Sometimes I need a 5-minute course on some aspect of Chemistry/Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry for which I've never had a class.  Mostly I just do research now.  

Plus, half of my textbooks just *sucked* for me. i see, yeah got to office hours for questions, and ask them to explain to you shit. i ask till im satisfied or get a reference, usually people help well. also study groups are a great alternative to wikipedia etc, group studying CAN be good if others are commited, (try to befriend the studious)  I do all that *FOR* classes, but it doesn't work so well for just 'research'.  ;-) sorry, should;ve caught before where somewhere you must've mentioned you do research. (adhd me, pardon).  All i can say is to get medicated, hope you good luck I *am*.  =P

Thank you!
