Spent the whole day cleaning my chrome browser and just downloaded an extension to see that there's still 536 tabs left. Sigh.. and this is only from the past 2-3 weeks

Update: down to 443 now I don’t get it, why don’t you just close out of all of them Clutter makes me nervous haha. This is a trait I picked up while learning to do life without meds. Right now there's a special certificate for work on my desktop and I hyperfocus on it. 
 Because it's stuff I need and have to sort through :( Kill them all and use the history feature to search for anything important afterwards. Changes are >90% aren’t needed
