(X-Post r/bipolar) What to do when Hypomanic for Bipolar+ADHD So, i got into a hypomanic phase today. I can immediately recognize it since I found I myself speeding in the road with my motorcycle and got several near-miss.

Here's what I do: I block online shop from my browser (I'm not in US, but you know what I mean). I cannot paint or write a shitty poem to save my life, and I know getting out of my room is a recipe for a disaster.

So here's what I do: I put my headphones on and play some heavy EDM at max volume, and dance like no ones watching. Just pretending I am in a club, being the centre of the dancefloor, being a big hot shot/asshole you can imagine.

DREAM LIKE YOU ARE THE BIGGEST, MEANEST GREATEST BEING ON EARTH.

DANCE, JUST DANCE LIKE THE WORLD NEVER ENDS.

See you on the other side.
