Lets talk about Management So a lot of us are medicated, but it isn't a magic fix (If only!). There are also a lot of us who are undiagnosed, or have trouble with medication not working, being unavailable etc. I thought it would be a good idea to talk about what has worked for me in the past, and how I go about my day, with my funky brain.

*  Lists! I imagine you're already a list maker, but sometimes, you might find that the staring at a massive list to be overwhelming. My preferred list is the [Eisenhower Decision Matrix](https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/eisenhower-box.jpg) . Simply put, you categorise the lists in terms of importance, and then work through them 1 by 1, avoiding the 4th Quandrant (I typically don't fill it out, it just represents all the shit I do to distract myself).

I also have a poster next to my door before I leave the house that states everything I need to do. I'll get a digital copy and share it if anyone is interested.

* Calendar. The one in your phone? Every event goes in there. Every. Single one. If its not in there, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist.

*  Limit your scope. 
If you're like me, you have a million raging ideas for projects that get maybe 10% of the way, before you have a brilliant new idea that you work on for 5 seconds before the next idea. Rinse and repeat. I have a rule for myself that I'm **kind of ** good at: 2 Personal projects maximum at a given time. Write them down. Finish them. You will think of others while you work on them, but try not to start. I'm not perfect, but having a rule I work with, works for me, sometimes.

*  Distractions.
Hey, its what we're all about. I invested in a pair of noise cancelling headphones - I know not everyone can afford these, but if you can they are an absolute must. I listen to music while I work, but before I was treated I listened to a combination of white/brown noise that put me in the focus zone almost immediately. I have no idea why this works, but it does. Perhaps someone can explain to me why. 

* Put your phone in your desk, and turn it off if you're able to
* Install Website blockers on your browser to prevent you going into the time suck that is websites. I have at one point almost sold my PC/Ps4 because I wanted to do other things.

*  Finance.

* Budget. you need one. Everyone needs one. Write it out. 
* Automatic Direct Debits are a must - And if you can, pay in advance. I pay my power bill monthly and I'm generally in credit with my accounts for this reason. Look at your past bills and work out how much you pay on average - Set up the automatic direct debit to pay your accounts when you get paid, +$10. (And you can claim it back later when you're in credit, and buy yourself something nice for being so organised!). Same goes for savings
*Long Term Planning. I'm shit at this, so I gave the plan to my GF and asked her to execute it. That leads me to:

* Know your strengths.
As above, I'm shit at long term planning. I'm still working on this, and I'm lucky enough to have someone help me with that.  I can only suggest: Meal plans, and the direct debits, with a big goal written somewhere prominently to remind you whenever you see something shiny online you want to buy (My reminder is $500 worth of paintball tickets I have never used. Stupid impulses). I'm good at talking to people and I'm empathetic like most ADHD (Current and former Sensitive Kids, you know the drill). This has led me into jobs with people where I'm able to help. I also find myself in jobs where there are 90 different things happening each day because its new and novel.

 I don't fit into the usual expectation of being able to do one thing over and over, but this is a good thing, not a bad thing. Job descriptions are a guide, not a specification, and this lets me go beyond what is normally expected, and I'm happy to do so,.

* The best piece of advice I can give anyone, ever.

My therapist told me this, and its rung true for everyone I've spoken with with ADHD, and its been said in different ways:

> "You have a lot of empathy for everyone else, Why not try having empathy for yourself?"

And that... changed everything. You cannot measure yourself by the other 95% of the population, you can only measure yourself, by yourself. Be kind to everyone, but remember to be kind to yourself. You **are** different, but you are not [a failed version of normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI) . You have value. You are funny, charismatic, and you have great ideas (No matter what the voice inside your head might say). Quite a lot of the time people aren't going to understand you and your awesome brain. But you can understand yourself and you can follow your truth. Try not to judge yourself by anyone else's journey. Your path, is yours.

I hope this helps someone reading this, and please, share your strategies for working **with** your brain.

 My project list is capped at 10. Maybe I will cap it at 2. researching this has been on my to-do for about a month.  I get distracted by the urgent/not important an awful lot. 

 I'm only a couple of weeks in but https://habitica.com/ works for me (for to-do lists). I used to be a MMORPG addict so I'm trying to trick my brain into doing productive things for the same reward. If you fuck up and don't do anything your party usually shouts at you since they lose health during campaigns which keeps me in check.  One of my trainers showed me this and I love it. However with my job there is so many moving parts in my job I cant apply it. Good tool though Do you complete all of them? If so, no problem! Quadrant 3? I move onto that if I have time - otherwise itâ€™s quadrants 1 and 2 allll the way. well, this is because I hadnt used the graph. just looking at it, I see where I've been going wrong
