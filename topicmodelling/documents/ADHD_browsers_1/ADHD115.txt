Apps / Software recommendations to help organise work? Hi everyone! First time posting here, so I'm sorry if there's a thread about this already that I missed.

I'm currently doing online university and having ADHD + anxiety makes it pretty damn hard to stay focused. I take 10mg of ritalin for work sessions (but I'm hoping to try a different medication, ritalin makes my heart feel weird?).

I think we all know what it's like to honestly have so many tabs in your browser that you can't see the icons on them anymore, and on top of that, having about 10 or so programs open that are constantly being alt-tabbed to.

&#x200B;

Is there any program/app/software out there that can monitor how much time you spend in each application, or something that dings you when you're alt-tabbing (I feel like I do it unconsciously just to help keep my attention going) to help remind you to stay on task?

(nb. I'm doing 3D art for school, so I'm specifically using Maya, Mari, Substance, Photoshop + zBrush. I'm not sure if that helps/affects any of your recommendations).

Thanks a ton, everyone! :)   I put an alarm on my phone for every 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the task length). This alarm is my 'shut down' alarm. Once the task in hand is complete I go through each and every window and tab I have and shut down everything in order to start a new task. I don't leave it as a mental note but actually make it as one of my regular tasks for work.

I've found since doing this, my work laptop is running so much better and I'm not constantly thinking of others things I need to do as much Thanks for the reply :) I'm pretty guilty of 'taking mental notes' of things and then just forgetting what that 'note' was 10 seconds later. I'll try your strategy and see how it goes!
