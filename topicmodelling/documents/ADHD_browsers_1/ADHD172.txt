Skipping words when posting New account, I am active in other forums using another account.

When posting I will write a post and hit save.  Go back later, read the post and I have left out a word.  Most times they are easy for a reader to determine the word.

Makes me appear as if english is not my first language or I am a bot.  Granted posting on reddit is quick and dirty writing for me.

Asking myself is this a sign of an ADD brain?  My other suspect behavior is to have many windows / tabs open in a browser.  Will sometimes even be reading something and abruptly open a new tab. Sure, it is. Our brain processes things fast, and wants to go fast, and so we skip words when writing them. It's quite common, don't worry about it.  This sometimes happen due to autocorrect. It's hard to proofread my writing on my phone as the screen is so damn small. [deleted] I do this sometimes, but more often I will either add in extra words or switch words around accidentally. I tend to think further ahead in the sentence and start typing a 'future' word haha. I think my brain is always 2 steps ahead of whatever I'm doing! Also yes, I always have way too many tabs open. Sometimes I gather over a hundred tabs on my phone because I'll be reading through one thing and then get an idea of something else I want to search. Then I never want to close them because I keep thinking I'll need to go back to them [deleted] Never been diagnosed. I am on desktop most of the time. Rarely read reddit on phone and never post. Don't post on reddit from phone.  

Would not be ADHD could be ADD, mean me.

Do you do the multiple windows / tabs on desktop? I keep a database and have a few thousand links.  Do search and have groups together for reference. I looked at my other account and have plenty of single sentence paragraphs.

I viewed it as briefly answering different topics and easier to read, bad eyes are more fun for me.
