Challenge yourself with xTab! 

Hi guys!

I've just found this [awesome chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xtab/amddgdnlkmohapieeekfknakgdnpbleb) that does one simple thing. It stops you from opening new tabs!

You can specify how **many tabs are allowed** or change the *behavior* on a **new tab event**: for instance the extension will either close immediately any new tab or the oldest of the opened tabs!

I personally use it with *default options* and *five tabs maximum* open at the same time and it's simply great. 
Sometimes having *some kind of obstacle* it's enough to prevent us from doing something. In this case, opening thousand and thousand of tabs!

About* other browsers*, I haven't looked but I guess that there must something similar for them, at least for Firefox

Tl;Dr: xTab is a chrome extension that blocks you from having too many tabs open. Give it a go!

 It says a lot about how I prob need these and the self-destruct tabs because of how massively stressed the very concept of these make me :P  deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0849  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/22158)
