Does having a cold affect your meds? "Dude you took your drugs today, why are you being like this"

That was my thought this morning, because an hour after taking my usual dose of Vyvanse, I'm still somehow bouncing between uncompleted tasks, having to re-trace my thoughts through my browser history to remember what I originally wanted to do.

Usually I know the meds have kicked in because even though I think of something new to do, I'm still able to keep doing what I'm currently focused on. Meanwhile, unmedicated, I immediately leap to the new thing before I even realize what I'm doing, and what I was previously working is so far forgotten that it takes me a good chunk of time to remember what I was doing just 20 seconds ago.

Sometimes my meds crap out a day or two before my period, but it's not that time of the month. I am, however, recovering from a cold--could this somehow be affecting how I'm metabolizing my meds?

I'm annoyed and have to go into the office to do some work today--I was counting on them kicking in.

Case in point: this is not what I want, or need, to be doing right now. I find alot of things affect my meds. Not enough sleep, not enough food, not enough water..... I basically go and check back that my basic needs are being met. 

For me it's usually sleep. If I don't sleep enough or well the night prior, my medication does nothing more than keep me awake/give me that "I stayed up too late but had a bunch of coffee this morning to make it through work" feeling.... If that makes sense lol. I recall my psychiatrist saying in our second session when she was writing a script and telling me about the drugs, that being sick makes them not as effective.  Whenever I have a cold, my meds seem to barely touch me, like someone switched out my meds for placebos.
