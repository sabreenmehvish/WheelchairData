Workday: An ADHD Poem Get up to make coffee,

Go to the bathroom on the way.

Return to desk.

Reach for coffee mug,

No mug.

Remember you were going to make coffee.

Start the coffee pot.

Return to desk.

Try to find inspiration for work.

Do one thing.

Get lost in the internet rabbit-hole.

Reach for coffee mug,

Still no mug.

Remember you made coffee an hour ago.

Go to kitchen.

Search for coffee mug.

Go to bathroom.

The mug is on the rim of the sink.

Grab the mug.

Return to desk.

Try to get work done.

Do one thing.

Check facebook.

Open 43 browser tabs ranging from news articles to hang-glider lessons/rentals.

Reach for coffee mug,

Try to sip empty mug.

Storm to the kitchen.

Fill the mug with now room-temperature coffee.

Nuke it.

Return to desk. Have you been spying on me?!? 
 I keep my flowchart of an ADHD morning above my desk in my room out of pride/shame  I help this by saying what I'm doing in my head. "getting coffee getting coffee getting coffee...." all the way until I finish what I wanted to do. also works in the grocery store and driving. *fights urge to look up hang glider rentals* So very accurate. I had to make three trips to my kitchen the other day cause I wanted water. Got distracted the first two times and I didn't actually get the water till an hour later. Try and remember where you were at with your work.

STILL NO MUG.

Return to kitchen to get mug.

Make sandwich instead.

Take sandwich back to desk to eat while watching cute kittens on youtube.

Dry mouth from sandwich, reach for ..

STILL .. NO .. MUG.

Storm angrily out to Kitchen to get mug.

Take mug back to desk to drink cold coffee angrily.

Watching kittens to feel better.

Forget about sandwich as it goes stale.



I like the idea that this poem could literally go on forever. :P Every freaking day. This is my life. I'm honestly mad about the hangglider part... Happened to me the other day and I have no idea why.... Truest part for me is the coffee mug in the bathroom. 

This is my usual day:

Get up to go do something

Stop in the bathroom (everytime for some reason)

Leave my phone or whatever I brought with me in the bathroom

Go back to desk

Remember that I left something in the bathroom

Go back and get it

Then go back to desk

Realize I got up originally to do something and finally go do it.

Maybe.

But it's probably been so long that I would need to go to the bathroom again so then it just starts all over.  This brightened up my day. Thank you. Pretty sure that's my exact morning routine.  I make my coffee or tea, but instead forgot I have it until it's room temperature.  The Family Circus maps they make for the kids is my life.  All day every day. The truest part is that I'd probably be inspired to write a poem like this rather than accomplish what needs to get done There's actually a flowchart for that?? Please post flowchart for our amusement!!! Oh man, the grocery store is such a labyrinth. I'm always surprised I made it out alive with some of the things I meant to buy. Once I say something a few times it turns into background noise and I don't notice myself stopping. But turning everything into a song (a la Marshall in How I Met Your Mother) works pretty well.

*Get-ting cof-fee, gettingcoffee! Get, get, cof, fee, gettingcaffeine!* Thank you for reminding me that I've been meaning to get water for the last two hours. Somehow ended up with coffee and a book. But no water.  I just realized what triggered that, maybe it's the same thing for you...that viral Facebook video about the hang-glider that looks like a plane? The Arhcaeopterix, which costs about $89k and you have to order it from Switzerland custom built.

Lemme grab the link  https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/58llo8/why_i_cant_get_out_of_the_house_on_time_a/?st=IYMCGT27&sh=18fce46d Last night I went "grocery" shopping. I spend about 100$ on liquids of some sort or another (no alcohol) and only about 20$ on food. Got home and realized there is STILL nothing to eat in my apartment. Sigh, I'll go shopping eventually......Again. This is gold. Haha!! Saved and added to my desktop wallpaper rotation.
 Literally keep it on my wall. It's one of my fav things I've ever made. I'm so glad people like it!!!!
