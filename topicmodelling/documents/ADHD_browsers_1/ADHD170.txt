pills don't teach skills Hi all!! Starting Concerta, but I was hoping to also put some lifetstyle changes into effect. What are the top 3 things you have learned/implemented to help you function in your daily life. I'm going to try to implement one new thing a week or a small interval i can handle lol. already put pomodoro timer into my chrome browser and on my phone. Thanks! Write down important events on a schedule book. Create a routine and try to stick to it.  Do you lose your keys at inopportune moments? Establish a place in your house (preferably by the door) where you always put your keys. If you ever notice you left your keys somewhere else, move them to the right place **as soon as you see it.** Make this a thing where you are never allowed to procrastinate if you notice it's wrong.

 I'm still working on this one tbh, but the general idea helps. Especially the "do it now" part since it's so easy to always put off "little things" like this and end up being late due to totally preventable circumstances... 

This technique is lifted from a book I can recommend if you're interested. I always have/had a real problem being late and forgetting things at home when I would be on time. Making a whiteboard checklist of things I needed to do and get together before leaving the house really helped out a ton.  3-5 nutritious, high-protein meals a day. drink lots of water.

exercise.

schedule the everloving shit out of your life. Google Calendar is pretty good. you may even try one of the paid apps or software that professionals and offices use. i always loose my schedule book or leave it home then end up writing in like 5 different books and forgetting things anyways :( Yes!! This :) I love my Hobonichi Avec, amazing and is the first planner I ever kept up with. I love the layout, I can do scheduling on the left, have my to do list on the top and do some journaling or daily reflections on the right. (The journaling is actually huge for me because my add brain is usually always anxious, I have difficulty living in the present but reflecting on fun/positive experiences after is nice  :)  The Avec only comes in japanese but I love the layout so much it doesn't bug me even though I don't read japanese.

(Sample of layout- https://1101.global.ssl.fastly.net/store/techo/pc/ja/2017/detail_images/r_o_avec_m/slide_03.jpg) I just got done talking to my therapist about this today. I really should get a day planner.  Hmmm. What book is this? I am driving myself bananas trying to get shit done but then end up watching videos of pooping sloths. I went online to check ONE DAMN THING, and then it was three hours later even though it felt like 10 mins. I need the skillz. I REALLY hate self-help books though. Is it...preachy?  Even if it is, I'll try it. I really need to get my thesis done.  I found out that putting a little hook on the wall right by the door works a lot better for keys, than leaving them on the table or counter. Even if you put them on the table every day, they can still get lost if the table gets cleared off. Write on a calendar and hang it on the wall. So keeping up with your schedule book is a skill. Find a "home" for it in all the places you go--at your house, maybe its "home" is your desk. At school, maybe its home is your backpack, etc. In each of these places, your job is always to, as quickly as possible, return your schedule to its home. This is something you have to work on--you also have to really think your schedule book is important. If you don't, you're going to have a more difficult time keeping up with it. Not preachy at all! It's written by a psychiatrist who actually has ADHD himself, so he's actually very relatable and self-deprecating at times.

It's called "Your life can be better: Using strategies for Adult ADHD"

the ebook version is a lot cheaper, like 2 bucks. I write everything into my phone's calandar, with alarms that go off when things are coming up, or need to be done right away. 

I am a slave to the phone [deleted] I recently got an organizer and I find it helps a lot, keeps me on point.
You know the ones for the year, kind of like a portable calendar you bring with you. I find the more you contribute to it, the more reliant you are on it. So if you make an effort to write down important things or to-dos in there, it helps a lot. My $0.02. [deleted] Whiteboard helped me tons.
