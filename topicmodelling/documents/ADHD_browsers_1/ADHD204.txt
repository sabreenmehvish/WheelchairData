I recently discovered that I have ADHD-PI. I’ve wasted the first 23 years of my life but this epiphany has finally given me hope. I just wanted to share my story, ask a few questions, and seek some advice about getting a diagnosis in Australia. I’m 23 years old and I’m a total failure, my life is a complete mess. I’ve failed more university units than I’ve passed even though I know I’m intellectually capable of excelling academically. I’ve never been able to hold down a job, I don't drive, I can’t communicate with people, and I can’t force myself to complete even the simplest tasks. I feel like I’ve squandered all the opportunities I’ve been afforded and taken advantage of everyone who’s supported me. I go to bed disgusted with myself, promising myself that things will be different tomorrow, but they never are.  I’ve always felt like there’s this awesome person that I have the potential to be, that I’m supposed to be, trapped just out of reach under the surface of my mind. The possibility of having ADHD had occurred to me before but I initially dismissed it because my limited understanding of it was based on stereotypes, I wasn’t aware of things like hyperfocus or the PI subtype. 

About a month ago I stumbled across a Reddit post by someone with ADHD, they described problems eerily similar to mine, and said their life completely turned around when they started taking Adderall. I started browsing this subreddit and I saw myself in every post. [Here’s an example]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/18jc78/you_think_my_life_is_easy/) of one of the posts that particularly resonated with me. I did extensive research beyond Reddit and discovered that I meet 8 out of 9 of the [DSM-5 criteria for inattentiveness.]( http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html) I also took [this test developed by Harvard and the world health organisation](http://www.help4adhd.org/documents/adultadhdselfreportscale-asrs-v1-1.pdf) and the results were highly indicative of ADHD. The more I read about ADHD the clearer it became that I’ve been suffering from it all my life. Suddenly everything just clicked. My whole life and identity came into focus. Almost every problem in my life finally started to make sense. I burst into tears; it was just this incredible earth shattering life-changing epiphany. Everything that seems to come so easily for other people has always been so difficult for me and I finally know why, it’s not because I’m an idiot, or a useless lazy piece of shit. This discovery was simultaneously liberating, exciting, and terrifying. I’m in the process of seeking the treatment that will hopefully change my life. I was wondering if you guys would be able to offer me some advice?

These are the symptoms I experience and some details about how they’ve been affecting (ie: ruining) my life:

**Failure at University**

I’ve spent the last 4 years studying a 3 year Bachelor degree and I’m barley even half way through. I’ve lost track of how many subjects I’ve failed. My pass rate just fell below 50% so I’ve lost my financial aid and will be unable to continue studying unless my special consideration is accepted. I cruised through primary and high school doing the bare minimum but that doesn’t cut it at a tertiary level. It’s so frustrating because I know that I’m more than capable of excelling at university. I’ve seen classmates who are much less intelligent than me breeze through Uni with ease while I struggle to complete a single essay. I know I’m not an idiot because on the few occasions that I’ve managed to submit assignments I’ve gotten very good grades for completely half assed work that wasn’t even a fraction of my best.

Even though I’m studying something I’m interested in (Media, history, and literature) I can’t force myself to do the work.  I want to get my assignments done more than anything in the world but I just can’t force myself to get anything done, it’s almost physically impossible. I sit and stare at my computer screen for hours, desperately trying to conjure up the will to write something, anything. I often go months without putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard as it were), even if I deprive myself of games, movies and novels, withholding them as rewards for work I’ll never complete.

I just sit there staring into space, overwhelmed because I have 10 assignments to finish and the deadlines already passed by weeks ago. I’ve wasted so much precious time doing literally nothing. If by some miracle I can muster up some productivity, every sentence is excruciating torture. I’ll spend all day toiling over an essay, and only have a couple of hundred words to show for it if I’m lucky. I feel physically and mentally drained as if I’ve spent all day working on a thoroughly researched 2000 word essay when in reality I’ve accomplished almost nothing. A single sentence can take hours because I agonise over every word, struggling to find the perfect way to phrase something. For every 2 minutes of productive work I spend 20 daydreaming. I’ll be typing away, then somehow I’ll lose my train of thought and 10 minutes later I’ll find myself sitting on the other side of the room staring into space, fiddling with some trinket and rehearsing a hypothetical conversation that occurred to me while I was supposed to be working. Getting work done at all, no matter how inefficiently, is a huge achievement for me. I spend months procrastinating, watching one more episode after one more episode of TV, playing just 20 more minutes of a game, spending just a little more time on an irrelevant but monumentally important project or research topic I’ve suddenly become obsessed with.

 I can only seem to get off my ass and work when panic and anxiety have set in when my assignments are overdue and I’m teetering on the precipice of failure. At that point, it’s usually too late. I’ve tried every trick in the book to remedy my terrible academic performance, but to-do lists, productivity software and desperate self-bargaining have all been futile.

I feel like a disgusting lazy piece of shit, I cannot adequately express how much I hate myself because of this. I want to work hard so desperately but I just can’t. Everyone else my age has graduated and started working toward their careers. I feel like I’ve wasted my life. It’s so humiliating when friends and family ask me how uni’s going. I keep making up excuses; no one knows what a failure I am. 

**Difficulty performing Small tasks**

I can’t get motivated to do small tasks. Tiny things that take less than a minute to do and that neglecting make my life objectively worse. Things like replying to a text from a friend, sending a quick email to a teacher, paying my phone bill, taking medication, putting things away etc… I don’t understand why I don’t do these things. I get so angry at myself for neglecting these responsibilities but I keep doing it.

**Difficulty communicating**

I constantly zone out during conversations and I can’t follow directions to save my life. It’s not just listening I suck at, talking isn’t my forte either. I rehearse conversations in my head and when they don’t go as planned (which they never do) I go blank and have a lot of trouble finding the right words and expressing myself. When I try to talk, all the ideas in my head suddenly seem so abstract and I can’t articulate them. I have a lot of trouble making friends and I’ve never had a boyfriend.

**Hyperfocus**

While I can’t force myself to do boring shit I don’t want to do like a normal functioning adult, I have no problem binge watching TV series or playing video games for 12 hours straight.

**Tendency to overlook details**

I’ve screwed up so many essays and exams because I misread the questions. I miss appointments because I get the dates mixed up, I get on trains an hour later than I should because I misread the train timetable. 

**Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria**

I always thought [this](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/10121.html) was social anxiety but the above article suggests what I’ve been feeling could be related to ADHD which could be why SSRIs didn’t work for me.

**I need constant stimulation and entertainment**

Games, movies, TV, books, comics,  music, internet, comedy, sports, my hundred-odd podcast subscriptions, I’m addicted to entertainment and novelty, I can’t even take a 5 minute walk down the street without my headphones.

**I Can’t commit to anything**

I have so many interests and hobbies but I can never really put in the hard work. I’m trying to learn Spanish but even Duolingo can’t keep me motivated to practice consistently. I’ve started and abandoned so many online courses on everything from history to astronomy. I’ve been trying to learn guitar on and off for my whole life but I’ve never been able to stick to a practice schedule or force myself to learn the ‘boring’ stuff like learn theory.

**I always forget what I’m doing**

You know how everyone has those moments where they forget why they entered a room or why they opened their browser to look something up? That kind of thing happens to me multiple times a day.

**Other Symptoms**

I have trouble starting and finishing projects. I’m easily flustered and overwhelmed. I have zero ability to prioritise. I constantly lose track of time. I underestimate the time it will take to get things done. I’m extremely disorganised. I’m always late, always stressed and in hurry. I frequently forget appointments. I’m constantly loosing and misplacing things. I procrastinate more than anyone else in the known universe. 

**Anxiety**

It’s also worth mentioning that my ADHD is comorbid with anxiety (diagnosed). I know something like 80% of ADHD cases are comorbid with other mental illnesses and anxiety is most common so it makes sense. Lately I’ve been preoccupied with obsessive thoughts about my parents dying before the singularity happens and we can all live forever as cyborgs. I’ve been overwhelmed with panic and dread every time they leave the house. SUPER FUN! I’ve seen therapists and tried meds but nothing’s ever really helped. I’ve struggled with anxiety all my life (even as a baby apparently), I’ve gotten kind of used to it. It’s not unbearable all the time, I just have to ride out the really bad periods; they don’t usually last too long. 

**QUESTIONS**

**ADHD sufferers who were diagnosed later in life, how did you come to terms with all the time you wasted?** 

I’m relieved to discover that there’s hope for me to turn my life around, but I’m having trouble letting go of all the time I pissed away. I’ve achieved nothing in my life and I’m so ashamed and embarrassed. I know I can’t change the past but I can’t help but be angry at myself for not realising I had ADHD earlier.

**To what extend do the positive effects of medication decline after the “honeymoon period”?**

I realise I can’t take a magic pill to fix all my problems, I know I have to utilise the ‘honeymoon period’ to form good habits. I’m prepared to work hard to change my life but I’d still like to know more about the effectiveness of medication. Would it go from 100% effectiveness to 70%? 50%? Less? How long does the the honeymoon period generally last? I know everyone reacts differently to medication but is it possible to get a rough idea of what to expect?

**How safe are ADHD meds?**

 I’ve done a lot of research and the general consensus seems to be that they’re pretty safe when prescribed by a doctor and taken in the right dosses but I’m still a bit anxious about it. I’m definitely not an anti-medication nut but essentially taking speed every day for the rest of my life can’t be that healthy right? Could it shorten my life-span? I’m excited at the prospect of medication improving me athletically as well as mentally (I've been a terrible athlete my entire life) but I’m slightly concerned about my heart exploding while doing something as strenuous as my ice  hockey lessons…Are these concerns valid?

**Any advice for seeking a diagnosis in Australia?**

 A lot of doctors here don’t take ADHD seriously, some don’t really understand what it is, and some even don’t believe it exists in adults. ADD meds are very difficult to obtain. Adderall isn’t available so it looks like I’ll have to settle for Dexedrine, and even that is illegal for GPs to prescribe. 

When I first realised I had ADHD about a month ago I went straight to a psychiatrist (I managed to get in right away because someone had cancelled an appointment). It was an absolutely awful experience. He obviously had his mind made up about me before I walked through his office door. He kept interrupting me while I was describing my symptoms. He didn’t understand what hyperfocus was, saying that being able to focus on videos games negates ADHD. He accused me of being argumentative (I never raised my voice or anything, just asked a few questions). He told me flat out that he wouldn’t prescribe me amphetamines under any circumstances, he noticed me struggling to hold back tears and told me I was embarrassing myself (how’s that for empathy?). He said I just had to take responsibility. He clearly thought I was just trying to get drugs to abuse and/or sell. He claimed that studies have shown that stimulants are an ineffective treatment for ADHD (lolwut?) and I should just start taking SSRIs again because my anxiety is the culprit (Total Bullshit, I actually focus better when I’m anxious because I’m so on edge. Bad periods of anxiety are the only times when I’m productive.) I couldn’t stop crying after I left his office. I finally found the solution to all the problems in my life and that incompetent motherfucker withheld it from me for no good reason. It happened almost a month ago now and thinking about it still enrages me. The way he told me I was ‘embarrassing myself’, the way he was so infuriatingly calm in his dismissiveness and condescension. I was vulnerable, begging for help and he refused. I failed another subject that I might have been able to pass if he treated me.  

I finally have an appointment with another psychiatrist in a few days and I’m terrified of having the same bad experience. I have to pay to see this new guy, I can’t afford to see someone else if this goes wrong. He doesn’t specialize in adult ADHD but the receptionist said he’s treated it before so I know it’s not completely out of his wheelhouse which is a good sign. Do you guys have any tips to make sure I get the correct diagnosis? I’m going to print and fill out the Harvard test I linked to above as well as a copy of the DSM 5 criteria with my symptoms highlighted.  I was also going to print a copy of the symtom list I wrote above to either read out or use as cues (if I don’t I’ll get flustered and forget two thirds of what I need to say). Is it a good idea to take all this evidence in on paper or will it look too desperate? I have the best parents in the world; as usual they’re super supportive. They agree that I have ADHD and my Dad’s willing to accompany me to the psychiatrist to back me up so I don’t look like a drug seeker. Is this a good idea? Do you guys have any other tips? Do's and don’ts? 

Thank you so much if you've read all this, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. I attempted to read that wall of text but unfortunately I couldn't read it. I am in Sydney, I have just been diagnosed. Private message me for me info, we can chat. I am ADHD-combined. I would love to hear from you!!

P.s. Can you "TL;DR" things for me?? I too found it hard to read your wall of text.

You'll find answers to your questions in due time. The good news is that you've already taken the biggest step towards recovery - knowing what the problem is.

Now of course I'm supposed to stress that only a doctor can diagnose you with ADHD (and answer all your questions about medication!) but if you don't have ADHD, I don't know who does.

But let me tell you the things that have helped me, personally - in order of usefulness.

**#1 - Freewriting.**  Oh yes. [Freewriting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing). So simple, yet so effective. By far, my most useful strategy for combating ADHD. I cannot recommend it enough. Just open a word document, and type out everything that comes into your head. EVERYTHING. Do not censor yourself. Do not go back and fix spelling mistakes. Keep the flow going. It's very therapeutic for me. It helps me to sharpen my mind - to think about things and find solutions to problems. All of my jumbled and racing thoughts can finally be laid out and examined. It's like popping a pimple. I try to write something every day but that doesn't happen - once a week is more doable for me. Also, since I write a lot of very personal shit, I use Truecrypt to make it impossible for anyone to read my journal.

**#2: Medication.** No surprises here. Medication works. Talk to your doctor. You may have to try a bunch of different ones before you find one that works for you. It sucks that ADHD meds are abused by people  and therefore so restricted -- but at least they exist in the first place.

**#3 Behavioral modification** Again, your doctor can help with this. What works well for me is this: Freewriting, then making a to-do list based on the freewriting. Then, I have a lined paper day planner - I write down every hour in the day 1/4 of the way across the page. To the left of the numbers, I write what I want to accomplish on that hour. To the right, as the day progresses, I write down what I actually accomplished. So it's like this:

    pill & breakfast   8      sleeping zzzz
    get groceries      9      breakfast + pill
    gym                10     computer/internet
    gym                11     got groceries
    shower + eat       12     Gym

And so on. Usually there's a delay like that, and I don't get everything done, but I do get a lot done, still!

I also have a calendar on the wall where I write down important appointments and stuff so I don't forget - and I put them on my phone, too. The planner and calendar cost me $4 total at a dollar store. Cheap.

And one more thing...

**#4 - Forgive yourself** - You can't get that time back. But it's never too late to make a change. Never too late. Here's a quote I find particularly inspiring:

"Forgiveness means giving up all hope for a better past."

There's no point fussing about it - you can't improve your past. But you can improve your future. and the first step is talking to your doctor. If you don't have one, get one.

And another quote I really like: "Shall we lay down and die?" It's from [The Edge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119051/). Good movie.

Hum, that's all I can think of for now. You're going to make it. Keep telling yourself that. You're gonna make it.

Oh, and here's some advice I gave to someone who was seriously depressed: http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/2ku4tr/life_is_too_painful_at_this_point/clqzj7z -- You don't seem depressed like this guy is, but you might find something useful from my thoughts there as well. Hey, Melb! I can look up info for my provider when I get home and settled, for an option if this current psych pans out (if you'd like! ... And if I don't forget... Prod away if'n I do!) I was finally officially diagnosed at 27 (later finding out I was diagnosed as 'probably' as a child...), back in July or so - and been medicated since then.

I diiid want to note a couple of things at least before I forgot though!  For one, it's most definitely *not* illegal for GPs to prescribe stimulants. Most (I'd say almost all) wouldn't without a diagnosis from 'higher up', and a lot would probably decline on personal decisions (plus I know there are some clinics that proclaim they "don't prescribe drugs of dependence" there), but it's the same as psychiatrists; they are able to apply to get the govt authorisation for you to be prescribed stimulants. :3 (I personally see a GP who specialises with adult ADHD; he referred me to a psychiatrist he works with for further diagnosis to start, and after that he manages my treatment plan, medication, how I'm managing things, and such.)

As far as medications, we don't have Adderall, right. Then there's worse news: the govt's eligibility requirements for authorisation are archaic and bloody stupid. Half of the medications available are restricted only to people whom were first diagnosed by age eighteen - if you weren't diagnosed, if it wasn't caught before you hit adulthood for whatever reason? Shit out of luck. Concerta, Ritalin XR, and Strattera are all restricted to a pre-adulthood diagnosis. :(

It leaves us with two options; on the amphetamine side we have (generic) Dexamphetamine - Dexedrine in the US,  which you mentioned, though again only IR, in 5mg tablets. On the methylphenidate side plain Ritalin IR, in 10mg tablets. Both are covered under the PBS, no diagnosis age requirement. My GP has also told me that coming *maybe* in the middle of next year we will have Vyvanse available - it was originally middle of this year (the PBS rubberstamps things twice a year, at mid and then end), but apparently it failed a criteria and went back another round, and then that happened again for the end of year batch too. We'll see. We also do have Welbutrin (IR), though off-label use. No Intuiv/Guanfacine.

*Anyways* um, yes. Info! :D **tl;drish:** Totally not illegal for a GP to prescribe (with govt authorisation), and our options are pretty much Dexamphetamine or Ritalin. But options exist! Edit: I also just sat in my car at the train station for half an hour typing that up on my phone. Priorities, right? XD 
I'm 28 years old and have self diagnosed myself as ADHD-PI. After speaking with my GP he referred me to a psychiatrist. Haven't gone to the appointment yet but I'm looking forward to it. I'm in Perth so I'm guessing the process is exactly the same as Melbourne. I have heard that going through the diagnosis is costly, I'll let you know how it goes. 

Just reading the symptoms and ticking them off like a checklist has been the most liberating thing in my life. It actually relieved a lot of the anxiety and frustration I was always feeling.  I just wish I knew about this condition when I was your age. I'm sure once you're prescribed the correct medication you'll cruise through University in no time. Just reading you're post I can tell you're fucking smart. 
 Hi, in Perth. I think try and approach the psychiatrist with an open mind. Most good ones, IMO, won't immediately start diagnosing but instead will take a few sessions to evaluate your symptoms. It can be frustrating as the patient but good doctors want to be completely sure. 

I suspect your anxiety issues are going to cloud the diagnostic picture. There is a lot of overlap between the two. So I suspect it'll be a matter of teasing out which is causing what. 

You also asked for stories about getting a diagnosis. I didn't do any formal testing...I'd seen my psychiatrist for several years for a number of other issues and he based his assessment on years of observations. 

I was given the Amen clinic checklist to fill out and return. Funny side note: my doctor said that like a typical ADHDer, I'll either finish in five minutes or never finish. I was the latter, heh... Hi. Wow, you sound like me. I feel ya. Same thing happened to me... only it took me forty-three years to find out :( Thank you for replying. I'm in Melbourne.

Thanks for attempting to read it! The irony of posting something this long in the ADHD subreddit isn't lost on me but I needed to get all that off my chest. The bolded subheadings and questions were inteded to be a crude TLDR substitute but I'll try to come up with something better. 

I have to go out now but I'll PM you later. #####&#009;

>__Free writing__ is a [prewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewriting) technique in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without regard to spelling, grammar, or topic. It produces raw, often unusable material, but helps writers overcome blocks of apathy and self-criticism. It is used mainly by [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose) writers and writing teachers.   Some [writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers) use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as [automatic writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing).

>Unlike [brainstorming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind.

>"Forgiveness means giving up all hope for a better past." "Shall we lay down and die?"

These are pretty profound quotes, I’ll try to remember them when I’m feeling down on myself. I’ll check out The Edge, looks like it has a good cast.

>if you don't have ADHD, I don't know who does.

Thank you, it's really validating hearing this from someone else with ADHD. Means a lot after that psychiatrist refused to listen. [deleted] same for me, reading the list and ticking them off! So good. :) >Just reading you're post I can tell you're fucking smart

Thanks, that's kind of you to say. I feel pretty stupid most of the time so that's nice to hear.

>Just reading the symptoms and ticking them off like a checklist has been the most liberating thing in my life.

I had the exact same experience. It's an amazing feeling isn't it? It was so spot on that it felt more like reading a list of aspects of my personality than a list of symptoms for a medical condition.

Thanks for replying, good luck getting your diagnosis! That's fine. Let me know. Not true! But, not entirely false, either. :3

That confused me (as I hadn't thought my GP had been breaking the law for months), so I just looked some things up myself; I can't speak for other states, but as far as Victoria goes, it's still not illegal for GPs to [prescribe Schedule 8](http://www.health.vic.gov.au/dpu/downloads/s8permit.pdf) drugs, including ADHD ones. I mean, it's illegal to just rock up to any GP and have them write you a script, oh gosh yea; But I never meant that! I did say they're able to apply to get government authorisation to prescribe - and *then* it's legal.

&nbsp;

Psychiatrists and Paediatricians are allowed to prescribe immediately for a medication amount of less than eight weeks whilst the permit is being processed, though they still need to submit it, and they need it to be able to prescribe for >8 weeks - GPs must wait until the permit is obtained before prescribing no matter the duration. But you are right that GPs *do* need support from a specialist - the [document here](http://docs.health.vic.gov.au/docs/doc/Prescribing-psychostimulants-to-treat-ADHD-or-narcolepsy--permit-and-notification-requirements) on the Dept of Health site mentions the requirements for GP permits generally need "evidence of a specialist diagnosis and that a review with a specialist has taken place within the last 12 months". 

But, that doesn't make it 'illegal' for them to prescribe, only illegal without the government authorisation I mentioned.

... I did kinda merge both the overall auth permit and the PBS authority together into one thing though, sorry... My bad there. PBS authority is just for Medicare subsidies - I suppose even without an on-record childhood diagnosis I could purchase Concerta privately, hm. Interestingly though that document actually lists lisdexamfetamine specifically also - So Vyvanse *is* registered for use in Aus! Just not cleared to be subsidised on the PBS yet. :/

&nbsp;

Thank you, too! I didn't know about the specifics of it before, and it's useful to know; and I probably wouldn't have looked it up otherwise. 

Though I should have been heading to bed instead of devouring information on it for the past hour myself... Sigh. Pretty sure we have the same answer to why we spent a lot of time reading things to reply... x3 Thank you so much for the info! I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to read and respond to my post. 

I assumed it was illegal for GPs to prescribe as I sought ADHD treatment from two different GPs and they were both very emphatic that they were 'not allowed' to prescribe the medication I need. It's nice to know that I should be able to obtain repeat scripts from my family GP once I've received a diagnosis and government authorization from a psychiatrist.  I can't afford regular appointments with the psychiatrist. 

It's disappointing to find out that there are even less medication options open to me than I originally thought. I've read so many inspiring stories about people being able to finally start the lives once they were prescribed the right meds.  Are the 5mg Dexamphetamine and 10mg Ritalin IR methylphenidate any good? The fact that they're available when so many other medications aren't makes me suspect that they're not as potent. If this medication doesn’t turn my life around it's pretty much all over for me.

Do you have any advice about how I should approach the psychiatrist tomorrow? Should I get my Dad to come in with me at the start of the appointment to back me so I don’t like a drug seeker? I’ve printed out an edited and condensed version of this post (pretty much just the symptom list and description) to either read out to him or jog my memory. I’ve also Printed and filled out a copy of the Harvard test and the DSM-5 criteria with my symptoms highlighted. Will taking in all this paperwork look too desperate? Is there anything specific I should mention or avoid talking about?

Thanks again for replying! I completely spaced on replying to you earlier in the evening, sorry! Work killed me today, atop recovering from having six teeth out a week ago... I'll try and expand a bit better when I'm on the train in tomorrow, but a few quick things now just in case..

With getting your GP to prescribe, I still wouldn't drop it on him blind - involve him in the process before it comes time for him to apply for the permit & prescribe; like, let him know you're seeing the psychiatrist about it and if you got them to send over a letter to explain and a copy of the diagnosis would he be comfortable applying for the permit also, etc. That way they're both aware of each other too, and can hdlp coordinate things if needed also. :3

As far as the first appointment... Tomorrow - today - oof! He may not want your father there to start, instead wanting to talk to you alone about things first and get a general idea before going to family members. But, he may be happy to - I can't know for sure, sorry. That said coming prepared with documentation and notes does not hurt! So long as you remember to grab them in the morning... Preparing and researching (and hyper-focus over-researching to devour all the info you can...) and all that in itself doesn't make you seem drug-seeking. 

It's about how you approach it - if he asks about meds, or mentions them, be honest and say you would like to try them to see how they go because they very likely could help. You've researched things, you would then of course *know* about them. Be open about it. It's different to going to him and saying you "believe you have ADHD, and could you please have some meds?" You focus on the disorder, and medication as a possible treatment plan, not on getting medicated. 

I would say it doesn't *hurt* to let yourself play up the focus problems and fidgetting when you're actually in there talking, to make it more obvious... But I think I was so nervous myself that I never even had the option not to be fidgetty and distracted. XD

Either way, good luck! Just take things honestly, remember you're allowed to take an active role in self-research and treatment and it *doesn't* make you look like a drug-seeker, self-diagnosis is an okay thing to do also because it's the first step with the second being diagnosis by them - *the entire reason why you're there* - and if he wants to take it slow and work over things, as much as it clashes with the impatience of "I **know** I have it just agree already why aren't you convinced?!", he's not doing it out of doubt - just agonising thoroughness.

You'll go fine. :) Damn! I'm terrified of going to the dentist to get a single filling, let alone six extractions. That's hardcore! I hope you have a quick recovery. 

Thanks again for taking the time to reply with all that advice, I really appreciate it. 

My appointment went so much better than I expected! I definitely didn't need to make a conscious effort to embellish fidgeting and stuff, I was so anxious it all came very naturally. The Doctor seemed to appreciate all the supporting materials I brought in, he was even planning on giving me the test I brought. He was convinced of my ADHD, and after about half an hour I walked out with a prescription for Ritalin. I'll be taking 10mg for the next few days, then it'll be increased to 20, and then 30. If it doesn't work he's happy to let me try Dex. 

I took my first 10mg of Ritalin this morning and haven't felt much change yet. My appetite is a little supressed and my heart feels a bit weird, but I'm not really focusing any better. Not exactly the revelatory experience I was expecting, but hopefully things will improve when I up the dose or try a different medication.

By the way, according to the Doctor I saw, Vyvance became availble about 6 months ago (very expensive though) and Concerta and Straterra are now availbe for post-childhood diagnoses. It might vary state to state though. That's fantastic!! :D

And yep; Totally called it on being so anxious that you fidget anyway, hehe... Remembering back, my gaze couldn't sit still on anything for more than a few moments either; Especially not when he turned to start writing stuff down - the few moments silence and I was looking at *everything* in his office..

I'm so glad to hear it went hassle-free though! Ritalin's a bit more... Subtle? Than Dex - Apparently Dex both inhibits reuptake of dopamine (so it stays in the frontal lobe longer) *and* releases more out, whilst Ritalin primarily just inhibits the reuptake of both dopamine and norephedrine. Essentially Dex will help you 'stay' focused, and then also provides that heavy 'kick' of extra-strength stimulus to the brain, while Ritalin just helps you 'stay' (but a bit better for that, from the norephedrine portion). You don't get the alertness buzz, but on the flipside you don't get the *always-switched-on buzz* which is not the most fun thing. 

I think the easiest way to think of it is that Ritalin won't make you just 'do' stuff. It's harder for it to give you that rush of 'Bam, sitting down and churning through everything instantly'. Instead it helps make you able to quash the urges to *not* do things, the ones that counter your smothered desire to get stuff done. On it you'll still likely be able to be distracted, but importantly you'll also be able to go "no, I need to actually get this done" and then *actually get it done* instead of still not doing it. :)

That said you definitely may need to titrate up higher too! I was feeling slight benefits from 10mg, but switched up to 20mg and it was noticeably better - and my doc's told me if I wanted to try graduating up to 30mg to see how I handled it, I'm definitely allowed to. Apparently 20mg is a 'regular' adult dose anyway, so yeah. XD Dex might work better for you too! It was absolutely awful for me, I lasted a week on it and even half a 5mg pill was something I never want to try again, but everyone's different. As far as side-effects go too, your heart might be a touch out of sorts as you adjust, but keep an eye on it still because it might be something more. Hopefully not! Mine fluttered a little as I started, but settled down thankfully; The appetite suppression's still a pain. At least it means I don't have to stress about putting on weight, because I lose it if I don't focus on eating almost too much... (But then if I go out with friends, I can eat terrible stuff and they look at me like I'm mad, but no regrets because I need the calories, hehe)

From what I've looked into, Vyvanse, Concerta and Straterra are *available* to buy (the latter two without the childhood diagnosis now), but only privately - Vyvanse isn't on the PBS at all, and the other two are still showing that for the Authorisation for PBS subsidies, the diagnosis is required :( [Concerta](http://www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/2172h-2276t-2280b-2283e-2387p-2388q-2432b-3440c-8839f) and [Strattera](http://www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/9092m-9093n-9094p-9095q-9096r-9289x-9290y). We can get them! Just yeah, expensive. :/

But yay! It's a slow gain to adjust to things and settle in, but things will definitely be getting better as routine starts with it. Good luck!! :D

Edit: I had the teeth out in the hospital, so I was under for the entire time - didn't feel a thing! Has hurt like hell afterwards though, but the past couple days it's finally going. Thanks. :)
