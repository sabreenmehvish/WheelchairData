My sister, who was previously against me taking medication, asked for my Adderall. **TL;DR:** My sister who was previously very skeptical  of my diagnosis, and against my choice to take medication, asked for my adderall.  I told her no, which she respected (and didn’t pressure me anymore for).  But, she then broke down and described everything she’s struggled with... and it sound all too familiar to my struggles.  She’s in pain, and it hurt to see, because I know I felt like her pre diagnosis. 


Her struggles have brought a new understanding to my ADHD.  She’s going to a doctor to find some help with what she’s struggling with (whether it is that she has ADHD.. or it’s something else), and I’m glad I can be a person to support her now.

Last night, my sister who doubted my ADHD diagnosis (diagnosed this year at 22) and lectured me on taking medication, broke down.


I was helping her try on a dress and she said, “so I need your adderall”. 


I froze.  I’m a people pleaser.  I’m awful at saying no to people... especially my sister.


But I was mostly taken aback... she was the one lecturing me months ago for taking medication in the first place.  I even made a post here about her.  I was so angry at her for not understanding my choice.


So I said to her, “I’m sorry, but I don’t give people my medication. You know I have a hard time telling people no, and if I don’t practice saying no now, then how will I say no to people who ask me at college?”


She respected what I had to say, but I could tell she was hurting... and not really because I told her no... because something was clearly up.



My sister then broke down and started to tell me how her life is going right now.  She can’t focus, can’t follow through, she’s not performing well at her new job.  Everything is a mess, and she described to me what’s going on in her brain when she try’s to complete tasks. “There’s always a hundred browsers open at once” she said... and we’ve all heard and felt that one.  She’s anxious, and tried some other things to help herself, but nothings working.  She’s going to her general practitioner to talk about some of her issues, she’s never outwardly said she wants to bring up ADHD... I think she’s embarrassed to admit it.


It kind of broke me down to see her like this... because that was me pre diagnosis.  Now, she might not have ADHD.  I know a lot has changed in her life, she might just need help for her anxiety, and everything else may come together.  But she is a lot like myself, motivated, but can’t execute (and upon other things that I just don’t have the focus to write right now, and you guys probably don’t have it to read).  


I could see the genuine pain in her eyes, and her not really understanding why she’s struggling.  It was really hard for me **not** to share my meds with her after that... even still now, I keep going back and forth.  I know her pain, but I keep telling myself **i can support her in other ways that don’t include just giving her my medication.**


Part of me if also grateful. She’s my big sister, 14 years older than myself.  She finally seems like she gets it, she’s not being judgmental anymore.  She sees how much medication has helped me, and listened to me open up to her about everything **outside** of focusing issues that I struggle with.  Finally one of my biggest supporters is starting to understand, and she’s learning more about ADHD. 


And I think I’m well equipped to support her now with whatever she’s going through now... whether that be anxiety, or the fact that she indeed has ADHD as well.

 That's great that you are so understanding.

But it frankly sucks that people can't really understand that just because THEY don't have a problem or something they perceive as a problem doesn't mean a diagnosis is fake or that they have any rights to be skeptics regarding another person's diagnosis. [deleted] [deleted] I can sort of sympathise with your sister being sceptical about ADHD. I used to be the same to a certain extent. I always thought it wasn't that big of a deal, and when people told me what their symptoms were, I'd usually think "well that's normal, right? I have that all the time". I never considered that that might be because I had it myself, even while having trouble getting through high-school and doing quite poorly in uni. It was only when the failures wouldn't let up, that I sought help and got diagnosed. 

Only after diagnosis and reading more about ADHD did I fully realise how much of an impact it was having on my life. Maybe your sister is the same. She should probably read up on ADHD some more (and continue the process of diagnosis she's started on).

I hope she'll overcome her embarrassment, because ADHD is nothing to be ashamed about. You can't do anything about it any more than you can change being left-handed. As I've said before, a diagnosis is like a user manual. Getting it doesn't mean you(r appliance) is suddenly broken, it means having something that helps you repair stuff if and when it does break down, and something that tells you whether the way you've been doing things is the right way, and if there is any maintenance you should be doing.

As for the medication, don't feel bad for saying no. 

Also, maybe encourage her to share her story online, here or elsewhere, anonymous or not. Just getting it out there might already help her a little, and knowing she's not alone out there... It does suck.  It hurt so much when she didn’t understand and was making excuses for my struggles.  I cried because my biggest supporter wasn’t supporting me.


I hope she’s learning.  I hope she understands a little better.  She’s listening now, and I’m grateful for that. Yeah she’s going to a doc.  She wasn’t sure where to start, and she kept beating around the bush, explaining all the ADHD symptoms but not flat out saying it. Then I didn’t want to flat out give her advice for seeking an ADHD diagnosis, because I’m not entirely sure she thinks that’s a possibility for her.  I just supported her and told her she should explain exactly this to her doctor.  And hopefully he can help her.

So much of me does want to let her try it (meds) and see, but my morals are really against it.  I’m afraid if I start saying yes, then I won’t be able to say no if I truly want to. Just scares me because it’s a broken window once you do that. Takes a bit to repair it, but if you use someone else’s prescription then you have already committed the crime once so what’s another time. 

Or if they had a heart defect and ended up in the hospital because of the stimulant. Well they test positive for methylphenidate and what is the first thing that happens? Yeah I don’t tell anyone, but my closest friends know! (One of them also being an ADHDer on meds lol)

Luckily I’ve never had any situation at school with people asking, just want to be prepared for if it does happen :) thank you  I was going to send her some videos that I watched when I was realizing I had ADHD!  My friend with ADHD sent them to me to help support me, and I can pay it forward and send them to her.


I told her that I make lists like this and discuss life a lot with my fellow ADHDers.  I think it would help her to read, and connect with other people. It really helped for me. It's possible that her rejection of your diagnosis may have been *because* of her own ADHD. If she experienced the same things you described, she probably thought "those things are all normal" and concluded that you must be wrong; after all, the alternative would be that, from her perspective, there was something "wrong" with her, and you being wrong was probably much easier to accept. Absolutely. I don’t doubt it.  I actually suspect that several people on my dads side of the family, including my father, have ADHD.  She could very well as well... I was just really the only person to realize I was struggling, accept it, and find a solution for myself. 


I don’t wish ADHD upon her, but I understand completely if that’s what went through her mind when she was realizing these thing about herself.
