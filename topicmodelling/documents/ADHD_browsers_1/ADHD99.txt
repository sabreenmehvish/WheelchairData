Tabs Outliner for Chrome: a lifesaver for those who suffer from tab overload  Convenient tree format.  Allows you to save sessions, windows, and tabs.  I love this thing.  (And I finally have <100 tabs open at a time!) You are a god! The amount of time my friends have harassed me about the amount and randomness of my tab... Ugh. use opera!!, tab stacks are amazing... Opera has spearheaded, created and introduced essentially every single browser feature and ability that browsers like chrome like to spout as ground breaking. (Firefox's add-ons and extensions is the exception.) So true. Wish it was as good a browser as Chrome / it had as much support.
