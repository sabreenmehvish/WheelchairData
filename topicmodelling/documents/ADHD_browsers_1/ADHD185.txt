Too many tabs/restart So as many of you know I'm working on a PhD dissertation but sometimes I get stuck. The best way I've come up with to describe it to my peers is like always having too many applications open on a computer. Most of the time everything still processes okay but sometimes just opening an extra browser tab will bring everything to a screeching halt and I'll get frozen (wheel of death for Mac users) for hours (sometimes days). The only thing I know to do is to shut down and restart. That's what I'm doing at the end of this week. I'm taking Thursday and Friday OFF (not "work from home," not "dissertation days") to hit the reset button and see if four days off will get me back on track. Anybody else tried this?  yeah. I regularly practice no electronics days. that really sweeps away the mental clutter. and i used to bring work home. never anymore, that's a hard rule I've implemented and I feel so much more focused the next day as a result- not perfect, but much better. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5195  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/06734) That's a super great analogy. I'm also working on my phd, I'm also in the writing stage :/ I was recently diagnosed i.e. last week. My entire grad school experience now makes a little more sense. I've tried "resetting" numerous times and while it gives me a healthier outlook on life, it takes me a LONG time to get back into things. I'd say today and tomorrow before you let yourself loose and off the hook, to map out the first few hours or days of your time next week. I try to do this and when I do it helps remind me where I left off. 
Also, I frequently felt guilty when I took days or weekends off in grad school and it made me feel worse and less motivated. Recently I realized that I'd rather be happy and relaxed on my time off then thinking I should be doing my introduction or background research etc. So whatever you do enjoy your time off! Hopefully we'll both be done soon and when can escape to the real world! :D I usually like to reserve Friday night and half or all of Saturday to let my ADHD rebound and go free. I do not take medication so having times to not be on top of my coping skills gives myself some time to recharge. 

Your analogy is great by the way! I do think a lot of common ADHD symptoms can be likened to computer operations and failures. Sometimes if I can't relax even when I walk away, I find it helpful to instead spend some time making a visual of all the "open tabs". Then I go through them to see if there are any I can relegate to "save and read later". I have a pretty hard and fast no-emails-after-4:30 rule.  Vacation? I don't know this word of which you speak. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6978  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/64911)
