Found a great tool for budgeting. Works on browsers and iphone I have been horrible with money forever but I've finally found something that works for me.  I know not everything works for everybody with ADHD but I'll share it because it's worked for me.

I've been using Everydollar.com for the last 6 months and it's changed my financial chaos.  It's free to sign up and use but I recommend paying the $99 a year for the premium features.  It automatically syncs to your bank account and imports your transactions then you just drag and drop into your budget categories.  There is also an iphone app so you can drag and drop when it crosses your mind.  Android in development. A side not, they're currently looking for a developer to get their android app up and running from what it says on their website.

Cool thing is, if you need help setting up a budget you can call and they will walk you through it, I did and it helped a lot to have that kind of support and direction.

tl;dr Everydollar.com has changed my budgeting life for the good, check it out. I've been using [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/) for almost a year.  It's been amazing.  I highly recommend.  I think it's the same philosophy as every dollar.   You allocate money to categories and spend based on how much is in that category.  Great way to make sure you don't spend based on how much money is in your bank account, while forgetting that your rent and student loan payment are about to come out. Another good one and it's pretty popular right now is Mint.com Too bad it's US-only... Has anyone tried Mint.com? I have had a wonderful time with it.  Yes, YNAB is great too for what it does.  It didn't work to well for me but I've seen it do great things for other people.  Thank you for sharing! Never heard of that one, thanks for sharing!  Looks to be the same concept.
