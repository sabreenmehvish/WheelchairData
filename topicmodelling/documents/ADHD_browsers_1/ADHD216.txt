THIS is such an awesome website I thought I'd share with you all http://thequietplaceproject.com/thequietplace

I set it up as the page that my web browser opens to. This morning I accidentally closed out of chrome with my millions of tabs and was a little distraught. I re-opened it and this website popped up and it really calmed me down. I had forgotten about it because I almost never close my tabs... but I thought that you guys would maybe find it relaxing or beneficial.
I hope you all have a great day "if you found the quiet place useful, please like the facebook page or add the quiet place to your circles on google+, there are more surprises to come."


Oh, the irony. I couldn't wait those 30seconds...  Wow mate... This really helps.. Thank you! This was lovely.  Thanks for sharing! If accidentally closing multiple tabs is a problem from time to time, download the extension Chrome Toolbox and make sure "Confirm before closing multiple " is checked.

If you try to close Chrome with multiple tabs, a pop up will come up that says "Do you want to close all tabs" at which point you can push cancel.

I think there might be a general option for that on firefox.  Great stuff.  The most relaxing moment I've had in a while. Thank you.  like this. I don't use facebook though. I wish it talked about how I don't have to worry about school. Those 30 seconds made me realize that my screen is dirty  .....................Wow... that made me cry...
Just, wow! That had an immense effect on me... I must be missing something, nothing happened when I pressed spacebar. If you use chrome, you can use Ctrl+Shift+T and it will open previously closed tabs. phi  Ï† ! I was giggling uncontrollably when it got to the 18 seconds left mark... =\ Thanks!! Press it again? Also ctrl+shift+t re-opens recently closed tabs
