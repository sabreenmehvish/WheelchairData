Sometimes the best way to get something done is to pretend you’re not going to do it. I need to submit some paperwork today? I don’t want to do that. I’ll just get online to check my email instead, maybe catch up on some webcomics. But what’s this? A new browser tab open to the site that needs the paperwork?! Hah, I tricked you brain! I actually got work done today.

TLDR: Sometimes the key to getting boring stuff done is to do something fun in the same place. That way you might as well do the boring thing while you’re there. Weird, when I tell myself in my head “I need to work on x for x amount of time” I’ll avoid it all day long.  If I tell myself “I’m not going to touch X today” then that’s all I can think about all day long.   Ugh yea when I say “ok today is a day off!” I feel way more up to doing whatever i have been procrastinating.  Like i basically want to do whatever i am “not” supposed to do lol I do this all the time to tackle those simple and tedious tasks that for some reason become intimidating and daunting just because they have to get done! Mixing the tasks with other innocent and fun things make them much more manageable! I do that to wash the dishes.

On second thought, I do that for all my house chores. I see you like to live dangerously. \+
