When You Have 28 Tabs Open In Your Phone's Browser ... Of things you want to remember to read or watch later...

And you realize three of them are the same. 

And this is not even the first time it's happened.

*I only go back and look at them when my browser refuses to open any more tabs.* I didn't think I was that bad, but then I counted, I have 131 open tabs... 

Great tip if you use mobile Safari is that you can use the private browsing mode as a second browser, that way you can have twice as many open tabs!  I frequently have to go through all the tabs on my browser and acknowledge that I don't have the capacity to read them all, and forgive myself for not reading them in the moment. I try to remind myself that I can always find it again. 

I also have a huge bookmarks folder for this reason.  >my browser refuses to open any more tabs.

What mobile browser does this?  Chrome on Android is happy to go over a hundred reddit tabs, and smiles at you for doing so. Lol, when you exceed 99 tabs on chrome mobile, you get a smiley face. Ask me how I know this...

**EDIT**: and 30-40 of them are just different reddit tabs. And references that I keep opening but forgetting to close. FML. When chrome stops showing a number, and displays a smiley face instead, you know you got WAYYYYY too many tabs open.

 I counted mine. Exactly 28 tabs open. We are tab bros yeaaa! Only 4 right now on my phone. That being said  is not counting all the other apps that are open or the fact one of those tabs has been open and on my phone for at least 3 weeks so far because I really want to read it but haven't "got around to it yet."  I identify with this on a spiritual level.  Hahhaah 28 tabs. Pathetic. 

I usually go safari to view how many tabs I have and to clean it. And one day I was able to scroll at full speed for few seconds. Made me curious and I counted how many tabs I have. 

236 tabs. 


Yep. And that‚Äôs only on my phone. 


On my pc it‚Äôs not much of a problem becuase they all close when you turn it off. On a Mac though, they remain open until you close them. 


I had about 5 windows with each about 12-20 tabs open. It was a while ago but yeah... wtf. I surprised myself that day.  Can't say I hit more then 10+ tabs at a time, but I've started to learn to catch myself doing it. Still annoying nonetheless because I always end up with at least 7 or 8 tabs before I realize I'm doing it again lol. I got this chrome extension called 'OneTab' which put tabs on a list so you can keep the tabs w/o having them all open.

It's great but the only issue is that I now have 159 links on that page and don't have any incentive to remove them. 25 tabs and I cleared it two weeks ago üòÅ God I love seeing posts on here that I could‚Äôve written myself. I mean I wish for the both of us that we weren‚Äôt tab hoarders but... it is super validating to see that I‚Äôm not alone! Haha I only go back and look at them when I come to sell my phone and have to erase everything and then I'm late to meet the person who is buying it. I found out when you have an excessive amount of tabs open o the mobile version of Chrome, a smilely will replace the number of tabs you have open, which is somehow more embarrassing :)
 The realness I have 500 tabs opened.... 28 tabs?

Get on my level.

Your chrome isn't tabbed to shit if the tab number doesn't turn into a ':D' face. [This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl?hl=en) is a lifesaver for me. I just let things build up inside of it, whilst still organising the things I really need. It also lets me see everything at a glance and remove useless tabs after a while.  ...I currently have 91 tabs on my phone, and another 50+ in Firefox on my laptop a foot away. Six of them are blank google searches. OTL read later feature in safari has saved me Use the extension OneTab if you're on Chrome, thank me later! BONUS :  When your browser inevitably crashes, those privacy tabs are irretrievable! You can only recover HALF of your 262 tab baggage! It's good to be able to forgive yourself for these things. It took me a long time to learn how. I don't know what to do on mobile, but for my laptop/desktop computer, I installed xTab for Chrome. 

I set the maximum number of tabs to 8, and selected the option that prevents any new tabs from opening. 

It has honestly been GREAT‚Äîit forces me to go back regularly to finish whatever it is I was doing/decide more often what's really necessary to have. Bookmarks are where sites go to die. Usually by the time I return to look at them, the site no longer exists...  **[:D]** I'm on Chrome/Android and sometimes it will open more, and sometimes it just goes again & again to the last open tab. Safari on iOS caps at a certain number (years ago it was 8 tabs, which was hell. I think now it's between 20 and 30). On my Android phone I mainly use Samsung Internet (caps at 50 tabs) but I also still have Chrome installed (been past the smiley for months). But if you close it, it's gone forever! Woohooo!  I‚Äôve had a ‚Äúwhere to go skydiving in <my city>‚Äù tab open for over a month in Safari mobile, and the only reason I know this is because it‚Äôs the first tab on my phone so I see it every time I have to scroll through my other dozens of tabs to get back to the tab I actually want to read at the front of the list... > because I really want to read it but haven't "got around to it yet."

This is how I end up with so many! Good grief! I have gotten bad before, with 20-30 tabs open on each of my computers & my phone, but I don't think I've ever broken 100 total. I'm only at 20, but I definitely cleared some about a week ago. I'd probably never actually clear them, but sometimes I end up reusing one of the tabs close to the top for some reason and it pisses me off scrolling through the whole set of tabs, so I delete some of the tabs that I know I won't be using again. I have never reached this level. I'm a tab noob. :-] Seriously y'all have made me realize I'm an amateur... Dude. It would stress me out. I never knew this was a thing! Cool! Thanks! Do you ever... read later?

I put some things in there when I first got an iPhone. I never went back to them... that was like 4 phones ago. Oooooh thanks! I love when a crash gives you the chance to start over! This is a great idea!  That's an amazing idea! I'm glad you've found a way to cope as well, it can be so frustrating sometimes when all of a sudden you realize just how many you've got to deal with. Also very true.  That's not true. Recently closed all mine cause I felt like safari was getting a bit slow, turns out I had 260 lol I usually realize how many I have open when it gets around 14 or so. I didn't know it got that high...  It's a 19 things to do in Seoul that you never thought were possible. I've read about half the article at least a dozen times. Once I took notes but then I lost them. I tagged a few of the spots on Google maps but not all of them. One or two of them I actually have planned out to go see like the abandoned theme park and I actually have the date marked on my calendar. For the life of me though I cannot seem to read the whole thing or remember where I stopped last time... I see it every time I open the pages in my chrome app on my phone and wonder what all pages I have open and why. 

 I'm in South Korea for the next year if that adds any context.  They all closed when I cleared my history which I was sad about but it would take me like 2 minutes to scroll through. I‚Äôm getting there. I‚Äôve switched to Safari for mac and now I can easily clear the tabs on my phone (close them if no longer  interested or read later if I am) and this also makes it easy for me to view my stuff to read later. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever checked this on my phone, but if I‚Äôm bored I might click something in my read later and finally be able to delete it. Still have hundreds of unwatched videos and unread articles pending, so this isn‚Äôt really 100% (read 10%) but it is better than nothing! Sometimes it feels like that's the only way... I don't love it, but it's a relief. Like being a tooth pulled. XD Well, the last time I used an iPhone (it was an iPhone 6 on iOS 9 that I had until last year) it limited me to around 30. Maybe they've changed it since then but at one point it was "true".
