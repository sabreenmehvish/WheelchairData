Simple extension to prevent the 1000-tab overflow Hey all, I'm trying to be more conscious of my internet habits, and I discovered an extension called ["max tabs"](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/max-tabs-web-ext/). This extension lets you configure a maximum amount of tabs that can be open in your browser at any given moment, and it will enforce that limit for you.

It's absolutely insane how many links I open in a new tab while browsing Reddit, YouTube or other news sites.

I set my limit to three tabs for now, and it's already forcing me to reconsider how I spend my time and focus while browsing.

I'd be interested in hearing whether anyone else has any experience using an extension like this to manage and become more conscious of their browsing habits.
