How mindfulness meditation is helping me overcome the disorder (and why it will probably help you too) Do you remember browsing the internet before tabs (assume for the metaphor's sake that you can't have other windows open either)? To me, that's what ADHD is like: Whenever you're doing something, that's *all* you're doing. There's no perspective, there's no thought in the back of your mind about what you were doing before this very point. Just like on a tab-less browser where you can't quickly check out a link and then go back to the page you were on, when you've got ADHD you can't duck in to a train of thought and then leave it: Once you're there, you're there until something else distracts you.

At least that's *my* experience with the disorder. Whereas normal people go about their day to day lives with some idea of context or purpose, we're constantly stuck in the moment, fluttering from thought to thought and action to action, lost in the bright lights and loud noises that lie outside the classroom window.

I heard this metaphor a while ago: Normal thought is like floating along a stream. While the water is carrying you along, you can't feel the river flowing. To actually feel the river, you have to hold on to a stick on the river bank and let the water flow past you. That's what meditation is like: you're told to focus on your breathing, and when you've been distracted you go back to your breathing. The 'going back to your breathing' is the key bit: like grabbing on to the stick by the side of the stream and feeling the water flow, it lets you consciously recognize your thoughts in a way that's quite hard to achieve normally. **Meditation is basically a way of observing and regulating your own mind.**

While meditating is an interesting experience in itself, I've found its most useful trait is that the feeling of 'mindfulness', as in being conscious of yourself and your surroundings as opposed to lost in your own thoughts, continues after you've finished. Now, every couple of minutes I find myself thinking *'Where am I? What am I thinking about? What should I be doing?'*. If the answer happens to be *'I've been staring at my hand for the last 2 minutes thinking about dinosaurs'*, then without much hassle I can go back to what I needed to be doing. **Mindfulness basically gives you the self-awareness and context that you struggle with**. It's essentially like having tabs on your browser: You can check out one train of thought, consider it, and go back to where you were. When a loud, attention grabbing thing happens while you're studying, you can notice it, think about it for a moment, and then stop.  If you suddenly feel like you need to check facebook, you recognize that feeling, realize it isn't necessary, and ignore it.

**Essentially, ADHD is the anti-mindfulness**. This can be treated in several ways: Medication, self help, therapy, etc. I've found mindfulness meditation a powerful technique to train myself this way. If you're struggling, I would recommend that you try it too. This sounds a lot like NRE. New Relationship Energy. You just start participating in something, you see something you like, and you're suddenly in love. Everything is roses, your new love couldn't go wrong. You can't help but evangelize your one true love to everyone around you.

The problem is that NRE wears off.

Being mindful of your boundaries and how your mind works will help you define the boundaries of your disorder and help you recognize when you're nearing those boundaries, no doubt... but it won't cure you. Worse, there will be times where all the mindfulness in the world wont help you one bit.

ADHD is not simply anti-mindfulness. It's a neurological disorder which affects our ability to concentrate. Meditation might help, but it will never cure the actual problem.

I'm glad it's working for you; but you're still in the NRE period of your relationship with Meditation. Give it a few years before evangelizing it to others. I've attempted meditation before and it's the only thing in which I actually have "faith", as far as its effect on my life and personal growth. But it's been difficult for me to stick with, much like everything else I take interest in or attempt. 

However, I'm not sure I can get with some of your descriptions of what the ADHD mind is like, because I have ADHD-PI and my mind isn't exactly one train of thought or being "stuck in the moment". 

Very rarely am I fortunate enough to be stuck in the moment. Normally I'm swimming through a sea of thoughts and ideas and emotions that take my focus away from the moment that I'm in. I'm near permanently stuck in "what if's" and "what could have been's" and rehashing old memories or conversations or planning for the future and worrying about the outcomes. 

My mind with ADHD full-tilt is like the browser with 5 tabs open, set to random shuffle. The real moment, real life, what needs my focus, is not in the browser but in another window entirely. 

The only sort of mindfulness that really works for me is concentrating on breathing with a mix of trying to observe the world outside of me at that moment. The only thing that can stop the thoughts is controlled breathing, and some sort of activity like trying to recognize a pattern, maybe noticing that the line of trees down the road is ascending in height. 

Meditation is a struggle, but it does feel good when I am at least slightly sucessful with it. 

Ugh. ADHD.  Honestly, what you're describing as mindfulness sounds a lot like doing cognitive behavioural therapy for yourself, checking your thoughts and examining if they're useful and lead you towards the end result you desire.

What I do that is closest to meditation is when I'm trying to quell anxiety and guilt that are overwhelming me, is to find where these feelings are causing me pain. 

I sort of look inside, take deep breaths and ask myself, "Where is this feeling actually hurting?" Usually the place I feel this is in my posture and like a squeezing in my chest. I keep breathing deeply and try and ask myself, "does this actually hurt? How does it hurt?" And like when you try really hard to remember a word that's escaping you, the discomfort seems to get further and further away the more I try and force myself to "find" it. 

In the end, I'm breathing deeply, not letting myself hunch and squeeze into myself, and I feel such amazing relief. I don't know if this is useful to anyone else, but I thought I'd offer it because it's something I only really discovered for myself a few months ago and it's gone a long way towards letting me manage my negative emotions, whereas before, I'd react by trying to distract myself or get absorbed in something else so I wouldn't think about it... Agree 100%. Self-compassion as well. There's an excellent book by that title. Go look it up on Amazon. Really superb. I've considered meditation as a means to treat my ADHD, but never quite new where to start.  Any suggestions? Awesome!!! I totally just made a post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2ahiw0/meditation_for_inattention_from_adhd/) asking about meditation. What meditation guide or techniques are you using? I'm new to the world of meditation and don't know whats what. Just keep in mind, if this is your first time hearing about it and you're curious to try... don't overdo it, and promise yourself you won't judge.

I started a few years ago by setting a 5-minute timer and trying to do mindful meditation, and I basically ended up a ball of fury about 3 minutes into it. My breathing was rapid, my forehead was all knotted up, my chest was tight, and I hated myself for not even being able to sit and JUST DO NOTHING FOR FIVE MINUTES AUGHHHHH.

I know I should get back into it; the science is pretty strong. But I can't shake the memories of my first few attempts. I know, you aren't supposed to judge. It doesn't matter how you do! But when meditation is no different than zoning out/daydreaming because the amount of progress I actually make is zero, it's hard not to get caught up in self-loathing. I see where you're coming from, but you've misinterpreted me if you think I'm calling meditation a miracle cure. 

I *do* think that a lack of concentration has a lot to do with the capacity of your working memory, and I *do* think that mindfulness can compensate for a short working memory by letting you 'touch ground' in the sense that you briefly step outside your train of thought to assess your situation.

I was speaking in rhetorical terms: No, mindfulness and ADHD aren't precisely opposite effects - but they definitely work against each other. [There is actually a small body of empirical evidence to back this up](http://psychcentral.com/lib/mindfulness-skills-useful-in-addressing-adhd/0004286). 

I don't think meditation is the be-all-and-end-all of ADHD treatment, which is why I titled it as *helping me overcome*, rather than curing the disorder. I'm also on dexamphetamine, which is enormously helpful. 

Edit: I should also add that I've been meditating (with varying consistency) for a couple of years now.  You're spot on. I've tried this. It was effective briefly, but wore off. The only thing that helps me consistently is methylphenidate. I'm glad that the OP acknowledges that medication is an acceptable solution for fighting this disorder and that mindfulness is a helpful tool that complements it well. I've heard too much bullshit about meditation being the end-all be-all cure, it makes me want to slap people. If it was that easy then we'd all be doing it, but you can't meditate the reduced-functionality frontal cortex away. Different terminology. What I meant by being 'stuck in the moment' was that I'm stuck in whatever I'm thinking about at that point in time: I'm rarely thinking about my surroundings or what I need to be doing,  and as soon as I do,  I immediately get lost in a different train of thought. I can see how that was confusing.  We have similar ADHD.  I do something very similar. I spend an hour every day to sit down and feel my feelings. It is kind of like meditation. 

I do not spend an hour straight. I just cut up the hour into three 20 minute slices. 

I feel whatever I feel now. Not what I felt earlier, yesterday, or the year before. I feel NOW, but I do the process in reverse. 

Most people feel the sensation and then the feeling. I first feel the feeling and then try to locate the sensation. 

It seems to me that you and me do similar processes. 

I have a weird mindset tho, when I'm doing it. I have the mindset of wanting to feel like crap or the worst anger ever because that's when you heal the most. 

Once I become a master at locating and accepting all of my feelings, life should balance itself out, regardless of what I have or don't have. 

I love this exercise because its a combination of self awareness, acceptance, and other words I don't know. I committed to this practice because I'm so tired of being unhappy, in general and specific situations.

I know this will work... I just need to be consistent and not expect results for a long while (90 days). But even then, when my life is balanced, I'll devote at least 30 minutes a day to avoid falling into old patterns. 

This is the journey of self trust. 
 Can you elaborate on this a little? I've been having a really hard time with life in general lately and I wanna try doing some other things to help my brain function better and get me through it. The therapist at my clinic recommended "Mindfulness" training.  They offer courses, and I've also found other courses given by the U of M(n) that seem to be similar.  Of course, I have yet to fully follow through...Shit I need to take my meds....(uh-oh ADD on full public display there) Wherever you go there you are by jon-kabat zinn Mindfullnessnw.com (or something similar) has free guides meditations to listen to. google 'free guided meditations' for some starting points.  I like the [ucla ones] (http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22) i started with search inside yourself by Chade-Meng Tan. 

http://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116924 Meditating is actually pretty simple: Find a quiet, comfortable place, take deep breaths, and try your hardest to focus on the feeling of those breaths. When you've stopped focusing, recognize what you were thinking when you were distracted, then go back to focusing on your breathing. Do this for like 15 minutes each day.

That's literally it. Look up guides to mindfulness meditation (there are different kinds of meditation, don't confuse them), and they'll all tell you a similar thing. There are different techniques, but the gist is the same: Using a physical experience as an anchor to observe your own mind. I embrace the fact that I have had so many interests over the years. There are two things I've stuck with for a while though - Tai Chi and mindfulness. Mindfulness is relatively new compared to my 15 year Tai Chi adventure. I've got to the point where a 10min Tai Chi session can quiet a busy or stressed mind, and it's fun. Think it's very helpful that it's both mental and physical. Sitting meditation didn't really work for me for ages. Anyhoo, why not try mindfulness, it's useful and interesting. >but you can't meditate the reduced-functionality frontal cortex away.

My understanding (albeit a non-professional one) is that meditating with a crappy frontal cortex is a bit like doing weights with crappy muscles - you're training it to be better. [There is evidence that mindfulness therapy improves prefrontal cortex functioning, although the study wasn't done on ADHD sufferers](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/12/15), but it also kinda makes intuitive sense: Mindfulness is basically about training yourself to control your mind and ignoring unnecessary thought patterns, which is probably an executive control function done by your prefrontal cortex. Ah ok yeah that sounds about right then :) 

I'm constantly stuck in my head.  This is why I was such a terrible administrative assistant and ended up having to quit. Every time the phone rang, someone asked me a question or pulled me from one project to work on another, it's like whatever I was working on previously no longer existed. I have no idea how to fix this.  You have it so right, about being self trust!

I'd realized when I first tried this sort of meditation, that so much of my anxiety was caused by an almost panic trying to avoid the negative feelings… If I trust that I can handle it, trust that I can deconstruct the negativity and trust that I have the capacity to grow and feel better… The fear is removed from the equation. 

I don't know if what I do about trying to feel and almost savour the feeling is the same as what you do… I think it's pretty similar, because to fully acknowledge and release a feeling, you have to actually see it for what it is.

The first time I tried this sort of meditation was after happening upon [this comic.](http://kimchicuddles.com/post/58058232933/meditation) I'd done Qi Gong before, and did find the breathing and motion helped me to relax.  The night I came across that comic, I was laying in bed trying to distract myself from overwhelming feelings of guilt and memories of social awkwardness that I couldn't let go. I put down my phone, and tried it paired with breathing and imagining the flowing motions I was taught in Qi Gong. As I felt the guilt and panic receding I felt so much relief, I started to cry. I couldn't  believe something actually worked! That I finally had a tool I could use other than avoidance…!  Sure.

The theory behind the book is that we spend a lot of time telling ourselves that we should be doing better, why are we working harder/faster/better/stronger, etc. (I'm sure you're familiar with what I'm talking about)

What the book helps teach you to do is to turn a positive light on all Tue hardships in your life, and by doing so, you free up mental capacity to think better about your problems. 

For me, it was like the icing on the cake that solidified my escape from depression.

http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0061733512?pc_redir=1404818741&robot_redir=1 I experienced and still experience the urge to avoid all negative feelings by distracting myself. This is how I coped all my life since I was little. 

But all of the sudden, it started making me feel worse. In the beginning, it worked like magic, but recently, the more I avoided my feelings, the more numb and unhappy I was. I realized I needed to do something and fast because even distracting myself felt horrible. 

No matter what I did, I always felt horrible BECAUSE I pushed down the slightest negative feeling (without being aware of it). And like you, I realized that this was a big part of my unhappiness. 

Once I began doing this feeling process, I've become much happier. I think more constructively, and right from the first session, I knew I was going through the right path. 

Even though I'm 10% happy, I have a much more optimistic mindset because something deep within me tells me I'm doing the right thing. 

My belief is so strong in this process that I could start a religion. 

The first session of feeling my feelings NOW and the sensations, I felt high. I hypothesized that because I recognized and accepted the pain, my body released endorphins. It feels good everytime I do it, but I don't do it to get high, I do it to learn about myself (self awareness) and to let go off all the pent up energy that causes unhappiness. 

I'm so optimistic too because all these years we lived pushing down our feelings till we felt numb and unhappy and now I've realized my emotions won't kill me. 

I feel happier and more creative when I feel my feelings than when I ignore them. This practice sets the stage to a better life.
