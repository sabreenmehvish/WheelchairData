Constantly looking for more productivity systems Before I was diagnosed, I was constantly trying to find new "systems" to better keep me on track in school and doing things productively.  Each new system I started seemed extremely rational as to why it would work, but they always eventually die out.  I think through learning I have ADHD and exploring the topic, I have been able to better recognize which systems will and won't work.  

&nbsp;

**What I think makes a good productivity system:**

  * helps to manage schedule/calendar/to-dos
  * helps to manage and tame ideas that pop into your head
  * doesn't require a lot of effort to maintain
  * has mobility/easy access (can quickly view/edit items)
  * uses as few different apps/services as possible
  * I have ADHD, so there's probably more that I'm forgetting

&nbsp;

Essentially, I think the purpose should be to enable you to get the most done.  It should help lighten the load we bear with ADHD, allowing us to focus on getting things done instead of whatever else is on our mind.  One of the big things that I found, was there is many productivity apps that seem over the top and try to micromanage, such as habit tracking apps.  I personally get overwhelmed by those apps as they require a lot of attention and updating, and I feel trying to remember to do that is a big waste of energy when I'm trying to remember my important to-do's.

&nbsp;

**What I currently use is:**

 * [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) - This app changed it all for me.  It allows you to save websites (has browser extension), pictures and voice recordings (both which can turn into text), make drawings/doodles, and make to-do lists.  I moved all of my non-regular bookmarks into here for later viewing.  I save websites and write down/record ideas that I don't need to be distracted by in the present moment. It really helps clear my mind.  I also keep some daily routine/reminder notes pinned to the top for quick glance and a general grocery list that I can check/uncheck.  It has labels and color coding, but I think Wunderlist does a much better job of organizing to-do's.  Another app similar to this is Mozilla's [pocket](https://getpocket.com/).  
 * [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) - I use this for daily to-do's. It is a really simple and no-bullshit analog system for writing down to-do's and getting them done each day.  I find I am more likely to do things when I write a few important ones down in here every day and then physically cross them off.  If I don't have my journal on me, I just add to a pinned note in Google Keep that I can copy over later.  Also note that you don't have to buy the brand name, there are notebooks just like it.  
 * [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) - I didn't like this at first, but just switched from apple because I like the new UI and it can sync with all of my other accounts.  There's a bunch of other neat features too.  
 * [Google Inbox](https://inbox.google.com) - This seemed overwhelming at first, but has actually been very helpful.  It uses AI to categorize and group your emails for better organization/less clutter.  It has smart email viewing that can preview package order status, flights, etc.  It also has reminders that can sync with Google Calendar and Google Keep.  It also has a separate link saving feature that doesn't sync with Keep.
 * [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) and [Freedom](http://freedom.to) - These apps allow you to block websites.  I prefer these ones because they allow you to make different block lists and set schedules for when to block which list.  They both have free versions but have better paid options.  Personally I'm willing to shell out some money for this. [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) is also good, but it is a bit simpler.

 **What do you guys think of my criteria and current system for productivity?  Do you think I'm doing too much? What do you use?  Do you use apps or analog systems?** I really want to solve this issue, and hopefully can help some of you out too. I keep on wasting time trying new productivity apps/systems.  I recently read [a post about phases](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7haa0w/phases/) that made me think this is a phase of mine.  I think part of it is because I was recently diagnosed and I've just been thinking a lot about it lately.  Does anyone else obsess over trying to be productive?  I think sometimes trying too hard to find things is very counterproductive to me.  

&nbsp;

**Other things I use (not directly productivity):**

* Google Drive/Photos - I've used this for years, but I just recently went all-in.  I was kinda annoyed with having data on different computers/phones etc, so I just basically set up all of my documents (bar big video files, etc.) to sync with google drive backup.  That way everything I need is on all of my devices.  Helps a lot with school materials.
* [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) - I used to use this before Keep.  In my opinion, it is better than Keep for to-do lists and managing them. I really like the "starred" feature that allows you to only view important to-do's.  It also syncs over the web.  The reason I don't use it regularly is because I didn't want the burden of trying to figure out what to put on Keep vs. Wunderlist. Keep just does more, which relieves stress for me, so I use that instead.  I still use Wunderlist to keep track of Books, TV shows, movies, podcasts that I'd like to get to. Yeah, I'm a bit over the top.
* [Breathe Meditation App](https://www.stopbreathethink.com/) -  I've heard a lot of good things about meditation, and I recently tried it out when I was super anxious about school.  I have to say I was a fan.  Don't know if this will be a phase for me or not, but it seemed to work.  My bone to pick with these meditation apps is that all of them have a subscription, which I'm not willing to pay.  But this one's free version works just fine.

Wow, after writing this, I realize that I am just being a big ole google fan boy right here.  But the reason I've migrated to google is simply because they all work together (well, for the most part).  For me (and I'd imagine many of you), keeping track/ trying to use a bunch of different systems to cope with ADHD just makes things more overwhelming.  I find that with this system I have to put in less effort to make it work, so less worry.  That being said, this is not my end-all, because I still have problems getting stuff done (by nature of course).  

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:**
I've been trying for a long time to make a system that works, but always end up in a cycle trying new ones.  I think that a lot of productivity apps are counterintuitive and I've been trying to find the best way to keep track of to-dos, events, ideas.  I use Google Keep, Bullet Journal, Google Calendar, Google Inbox, Cold Turkey, and Freedom.  What do you use and why?

 Just set up my bullet journal thanks to your link. Giving it a try to see how it goes. I don't use google because on internet nothing is free. I don't trust them. I don't trust all these 'apps' either. What info do they collect? And the fact they present it as perhaps an ADHD tool means as soon as you make Yet Another Login for a datamining site... 

I use a small paper agenda with address book. I have few appointments. One a day is tiring enough. I don't have much to do.  Awesome! Hopefully it works for you.  I'm a big fan of how simple it makes things. Valid point.  As a CS major, I can respect that.  Its hard to stay off of the web.  

Personally, I've accepted the tradeoff.  For me, the cost of them selling my info to ad agencies doesn't outweigh the benefit I receive from these apps.  As far as sensitive info goes, I trust Google.  I don't feel like I need to hide anything except my SSN and bank info, and I don't see Google selling that.  

If you had a busier schedule do you think you would use more internet apps? No, most likely not.

Mt autistic side already wants to flee from reality and avoid dealing with social situations. When you see people in the street these days they are all absorbed into their phones. It would be *so* easy for me to use a phone with its apps as a shield to avoid people talking to you. If the devil wanted to return to Earth he's hide in ICT and become our phones :-) I don't have a cell phone, never had. It would be too easy for me to hide in there.

I think...well, heh...science is often a little behind me, now science caught up with me and it says that using a mobile phone makes you dumber. :-)

I have found that what I think will happen will, mostly about 2 years later, in the field of ICT. ity must be my INTP and my capacity to zoom out and see connections where others don't. It is just sad I cannot apply these skills to anything. 

So I see innate problems with ICT. ICT is structurally a flawed technology and it is dangerous because it deals with what makes us human, language. That is why it has been so greedily accepted.  So I would not use many apps even to assist me. I have a brain, flawed as it is, which is the most advanced and complex structure known to exist in the universe, the result of millions of years of evolution. I think that should be enough. As for ICT, we aren't morally ready yet to use it properly and we aren't using it for what is meant for.

But I am at heart a McLuhanist.
