I like myself better at the end of my day than at the start I think on this sub as a whole, we tend to focus on the great things our medications allow us to achieve, but at the consequence of isolating those of us who dislike huge aspects of our medications.

**This is a thread for people who identify with the latter part of that sentence.**

Let it off your chest.

Personally? I love the end of my days. I feel like there's so many things I'm curious about, I mentally come up with another topic I want to read about before I can finish the one I'm currently on. A lot of the time I'll use a seperate browser tab to keep track of each of the topics I want to research before I forget them. I'll jump between them practically every 7 minutes, and although I get why that would irritate a lot of people, **it works for me.** The best way I can summarize it is that it's like a whirlwind of questions, thoughts, and desires perhaps that built up throughout the day. Like a dam finally breaking.


At the end of the night I'll get to maybe 20% of them, it feels like there's never enough time for everything. And although that makes me a little sad, the entire process is a joyful one where I genuinely feel *excited* about things. I feel like myself. On my meds it's all business all the time, I almost never work on hobbies or read about my interests - so during the day I tend to feel very detached, like I'm just checking things off of a never ending to do list.


Don't get me wrong, I *truly* am grateful for my meds, they're necessary for me to do day to day tasks like driving safely, holding a job, and managing school - but I don't like them. I don't like being on them, a part of me dreads taking them every morning. 

I know without a doubt, if my parents didn't force me to take them as a kid, I would be in a worse place today. Regardless, I will always like myself better at the end of my day, than at the start. I completely get this. I quit taking my meds for the last 3 months because I hated the way I felt all the time. Total loss of interest in hobbies and anything except just zoning out in front of the TV. In thinking of going back on because my job performance has been slipping. But I don't know if I really want to. I've been considering a career field that may be more suited to how my brain works instead of my current field (which is office work where I stare at the same damn computer every day all day doing the same 4 damned tasks over and over and over and over to infinity). I missed my hobbies so much but I didn't even realize it until I took this self imposed vacation from my meds (probably not the best move and I know I need to discuss these concerns with my doctor). Thanks for allowing me a place to vent. Good luck to you in your work/school!
