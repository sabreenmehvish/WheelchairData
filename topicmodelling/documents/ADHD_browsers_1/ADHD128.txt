Two weeks in with medication. Days on vs. Days off. Like the title says, I'm in the middle of my first two weeks/titration.
15mg Adderall (Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine)


So, its been very eye opening. I'm sure most of you can relate when I say that I was not expecting the absolute waves of calm that came. It felt like a mental symphony I was not aware of in the first place stoped playing and only a single violin was left playing and I was able to just focus on that one violin. It's weird. It's amazing. 

The funny thing is that before medication I was self medicating with a TON of coffee (often starting the day with a triple shot redeye and lots of coffee/5 hour energy) and nicotine gum (former smoker that ended up using nicotine gum for focusing help while at work). With medication I desire nothing. I don't feel a need to stack everything, I just feel calm and want to get working. 


I'm not an everyday user - my use is for the work week and I tend to take a day off if/when the work eases up - I'm in a high stakes, high output position with dips in the week. I was afraid I would just want to keep taking medication but I find that when I have a day where I don't need medication I want to be OFF. 

So, on an off day I'm finding that I'm deep into my normal standby behavior of bouncing from tab to tab in my browser and  not getting much of anything done. Its kind of like the difference between a tightly bound bunch of uncooked spaghetti versus the same bunch being carelessly tossed on the floor. 


Interesting side effect - my handwriting is pretty much from a different human being. It's crisp and legible.
