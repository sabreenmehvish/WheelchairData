"If you want to know what an ADHD persons mind feels like, imagine a web browser with 2,857 tabs open. All.The.Time." - Reeps one  I literally have like 30+ tabs open at the least like everyday and my girlfriend always goes "Why the fuck do you have so many tabs?" and I go "Oh, I don't know." and close like 90% of them. 30 minutes later I have a bunch of tabs again of random wikipedia articles, amazon, reddit, facebook, forums for specific topics, etc again. My web browser had 440 tabs open. Recently I spent a few hours reading them all and got it down to 198 tabs as of right now.

How do I get my browser diagnosed? Perfect, except it leaves out the part about tabs randomly opening, closing, and jumping to the foreground.  It's always little this at work: "yeah you need to.. Let me show you, do you have a browser opened somewhere *grabs mouse* holy.. why do you have 4 browser windows open with 30 tabs each" I'm that person who ends up having 50 tabs open, most of which are google "...And all the tabs are playing something." Same, though. It get's really stressful, doesn't it? especially when people don't understand and just say your bad @ life when it takes you longer to do a task... And randomly at periods between 5 seconds and 10 minutes a random background tab will steal focus and come to the foreground.   
  
or you get stuck on www.reddit.com or that tv trope site and can't change tabs to anything else for 3hrs I just bookmark 18,000 things that I'll never actually get around to reading because I've already bookmarked more on top. Ugh.  This is why I HATE IT when people ask , "Whatcha thinkin bout?"

I just say "I don't know" then they get pissed bc I didn't feel like explaining the 10000000 different processes going on in my brain at once.  Same reason I've been standing here in front of the coffee maker for almost 30 minutes....I'm waiting on my brain to shut up so that I am focus on making coffee.


But seriously...please tell me someone else's brain is also a constant barrage of just...noise...just never stops.  I can't describe it even.  It's just fjruejdjgiejsjxJSJENDJSJCJSBFHDHjdjdbdj.......but with words...constantly. I open 40 tabs then get upset when Firefox runs out of memory and crashes.   Then I reopen it and again load 40 tabs.    Every tab leads to 5 more!    have that and have the browser automatically switch tabs at random intervals. 

Oh cool a dolphin video. Where is this? Australia? Whoa they have plastic bills? Canada too? Wow their Prime Minister looks adorbs with those pandas! Why Pandas? China agreement. Top 10 Chinese knockoffs... I love this analogy haha so perfect! I always say it's like trying to listen to a song when there are 10 or so playing in the background. Very tricky. Just as you mentioned this, I currently have 9 tabs open! Sometimes I look back at my tabs and think 'how the fuck did I get from googling 'Best restaurants for dinner tonight' to 'What are the 7 deadliest ducks known to man?' The modern day internet is a trap intended to destroy the productivity of people with ADHD.  I feel like the only one here who can't standing having extra tabs... If I'm not actively using a tab, I close it. I have a folder in my bookmarks bar labelled "TabStorage" and just right-click -> 'bookmark all'. I save all the tabs in a folder named by time stamp inside of the main folder so I can peruse back on anything that I may have wanted to actually add to my bookmarks. This sounds like me, although I'm not formally diagnosed with ADHD. It's stressful having so much to think about all at once. And doubly so when you're caught between so many tasks. You feel stuck. You don't even have to imagine - just try and open Firefox on my laptop :D

I'm now limited to 3 windows with a total of 53 tabs, but there was a point where I had 300. I liken it to multiple radio stations playing at once. It's a Hydra problem. You slay one, three grow in its place. I got real tired of my own shit after about ten years so now, about twice a week, I force myself to read all tabs before opening new ones. I meant to tighten the screws on the doorknob yesterday. This started in the morning, after getting sidetracked every time I went to get the screwdriver with cleaning or doing something else. I did it around one o'clock this morning.  I've hit actual 4-digit open tab count.  Firefox's session restore doesn't reload tabs after a restart until you switch to them, and while it doesn't exactly scale *gracefully*, it doesn't completely choke like it probably would if it were trying to load them all for real.

Which means if you're in the habit of leaving tabs open to do something with them later — post them somewhere, finish reading them, try out that recipe, whatever — and then never get around to it, and let that go for a couple years…. What I hate is if I have 80 tabs that I've opened and I find one that is a 404 not found or something like that.   It makes me SO uncomfortable to think that I might be missing out on some awesome web page,  I figure if I opened the tab it must have been something I wanted/needed to read,  but now I have no clue what it was!   Seriously that shit will bother me for hours and it's not like any of the other tabs are life-changing,  if they were that important I'd have read them right away instead of opening them in new tabs!
 And at least one of them is playing music. But the tab buttons are too small to see the icon telling you which one it is... Huh. Met that dude when he came to my Island to play some mouth-dubstep Wait, how is this is an ADHD thing?...

I've always been the type to have a bunch of reading material/ games and stuff pending. This goes from having a bunch of tabs open, a second, and maybe even a third browser open and active. Oh and in each browser a bunch of bookmark folders I've created in ATTEMPT to keep my saved stuff organized in categories. 
That and also an endless "watch later" playlist on youtube plus too many saved links on reddit and fb. Should I also mention the links and images I send to myself on a fb chat I have with myself too or is that too much? This is the truth.  48 tabs for me currently, mostly pages I mean to read and make a post about... EVENTUALLY Am I the only one that actually gets super frustrated if I have lots of tabs open? If there's something I think I may want to come back to later, I bookmark it to a specific folder and close the tab. The only time I leave tabs open is if I'm in the middle of something that requires all of the tabs (e.g. homework assignments, research, comparing internet/cable providers, etc.) and all of the open tabs are related to each other aside from the occasional Pandora or facebook tab. I close *the ENTIRE browser* when I have finished and it's a beautifully freeing feeling. When reading this post, I noticed I had at least 10 tabs open... with more to come if I find something interesting during reading. I have 20 tabs open on my Microsoft laptop, around 15 on my Mac, and around 25 tabs open on my iPhone. 

Oops. ...and they are ALL Reddit coincidentally.. I'm apparently the minority that rarely has more than 5 tabs open.

I don't like using my mouse, and find keyboard shortcuts for everything. So I use Ctrl-Tab to navigate through my tabs. I'm not tabbing through that many browser tabs and I immediately close something as soon as I stop using it. Hell, I find myself using Ctrl-Tab Shift-T to *reopen* something I closed habitually even though I wasn't done with it yet.

For me it's just that every thing is the most interesting thing and commands my attention.

That glowing exit sign in my peripheral vision at the movie theater. That person's squeaky brakes that just drove by. That thumping noise of my downstairs' neighbor's dog running around their apartment.

Any interruption to the flow is immediately picked up on and distracts me. Don't forget the few tabs playing music that you just cant turn off Ha!

The trick to overcoming this is to have three different browsers open all the time, like I do. This is what multiprocess tabs was made for. to me, ADD feels like a fog with millions of things just flying by, but i can't really see anything. It's like there's always several things going on in my head, a lot of noise, but at the same time it's quiet. My mind jumps all the time, not able to stick to one thing and it's really annoying. This is what it feels like when I'm not on medication.
 That feel when you realize you just spent the past 3 hours down a Wikipedia hole, and there's a trail of 50 tabs in the wake. I installed OneTab thinking that when I had 50 tabs open I would just send them all to OneTab and that would resolve everything.   Only even if I send them all to Onetab,  if I open just one more tab it will multiply to 50 again over the course of an hour anyways.   I got most of the way through your comment thinking Yup i just closed all of my tabs 2 seconds ago.... and then got to "amazon" and it reminded me to look for a salad spinner. Which I must do before reading the next 8 words. 
Long story short, I'm back to having 30+ tabs open again. Oops.  Have you tried telling it to just focus and apply itself?

Edit: Wow, my first gold! Thank you, kind internet stranger! Use getpocket and save them there rather to read later. Tabs are not kind to computer resources.  Computers inhale medication. Crush up some Adderall and put it in your intake vent. One of my biggest mental health "wins" was getting to a point where I could right click on the first tab, and select "close all tabs to the right" and start over from scratch without freaking out.  Feels good man. ADHD is much like visiting a shady porn site with random pop ups, pop unders, talking ads about penis enlargements and trading secrets. I mean I wouldn't know but this friend of my cousin's car mechanic told me. Exactly ;)  this is so, so familiar! if i have time before they grab my mouse, i'll try to open up a browser that i never use (e.g., internet explorer 😂) so that my coworker doesn't see the hot mess of dozens of tabs that i've always got open on google chrome. Not to mention the ones in the virtual desktops >why do you have 4 browser windows open with 30 tabs each

It's called organization JEEZ. I hate when I can no longer see the x's on the tabs...  ADHD is one of those things that most people have a warped and usually completely wrong perception about. Some people think it just means you get distracted sometimes, or that it means you talk non-stop are always fidgeting. 

As I've grown more comfortable with who I am and how ADHD affects me personally, I always try to explain to those I spend time with what it is and what the symptoms are. Once people start to understand they become a lot more empathetic about it. On the occasional day when I forget to take my meds in the morning, my boss can recognize it very quickly and adjusts to help me cope with it a lot easier.  I don't know what it is about TVTropes, but it's so much worse than any other site for this! Something reminds me of a show I watched as a kid, and the next thing I know, it's 3 AM, and I have 50 tabs open, 10 if which are copies of the "Big Damn Heroes" article...  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/tvtropeswillruinyourlife I usually just tell them and wait for them to glaze over or beg me to stop talking.  Same here! Unused tabs bother the fuck out of me!  Paste the url into google to see if it has a cached copy? That's what I try first, anyway. I mean, it's not exclusively an ADHD thing. I know lots of "normies" with dozens of tabs open at any time.

It's just a metaphor for the thought process of someone with ADHD. Same. I start on one topic, and by the time I get though I'm 8 subjects away and don't even remember why I saved something :( You are treating bookmarks the way people treat tabs And you want to hoard them all because you'll totally get around to reading about all these interesting things. I just end up having 90 OneTabs saved with countless tabs in them. So. Many. Tabs. Still helps though. Otherwise I refuse to close them, because I think I'll actually get around to reading them. (Has never happened in the past, but going forward I will totally read 100% of the things.) Tabs outliner is a good one too, I use them both with tabs outliner more used for "stuff I need to come back to but can't right now because I need to do other stuff..."  Late to the party, but SessionBuddy on Chrome is my lifesaver. You can save a session, then at any point reopen a tab from a past session. I'll save my session, close chrome, then reopen with a blank slate, while still being able to open any of the tabs from last save. SessionBuddy + The Great Suspender means I can browse the internet without my computer freaking out. Damn dude. Too real  Oh lord... *breathe*... *breathe*... 10...9...8... ...mom? Is that you? I'm not normally a big fan of overly SJW type culture or words and memes but *you're* ***fucking*** ***TRIGGERING ME***. I love you. Ohhhsheeeeeeitttttt Triggered. [deleted]

I still have saved links on reddit from five years ago.  it's also nice for if you messed up and lose those tabs you might read but might not ever read. At least you'll have them saved. [deleted]

this is freaking amazing 😂 I embrace it, my machine is my domain, I'll open them a new window if they want the wheel.   
   
Which is the least I can do, there's no way they're navigating the multi-hundred tab maelstrom. To throw them into that would be cruel  Thanks to `xmonad`, I have 9 workspaces (virtual desktops). Thanks to ADHD, I have one entire workspace dedicated to tabs I'm going to look at later. I try to organize my tabs into several browser windows each representing a theme or time (for example, this current tab resides in the window for "this morning's browsing"). The "later" workspace has 6 windows. Luckily only 18 tabs, but that's mainly because I lost all my open tabs some weeks ago, hundreds of them. They didn't reopen after a reboot. I felt so empty, yet so free.

I keep meaning to enact a routine to keep down my number of open tabs, letting myself be inspired by garbage collection in programming languages. So far I just run a pass every now and again, sending people the links I was keeping open to send them. Always with a fair warning first, of course. "I'm going to send you everything I had been intending to for the last couple of weeks. Prepare for a flood of links." This. This is my limit. When I can no longer see tab logos, I'm out. Which is why Firefox is a dangerous browser for me xD scrolling tab bar. I feel your pain, I'm right there with you  deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1795  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/21350) I think it's funny how often I end up wondering what my mindset was back when I saved that very pointless, very questionable article in that very unreliable site. It's either that or I'm somehow reading something wayy too advanced for me to fully understand.  Basically. But out of sight, out of mind...right? I've been carrying some of them over since early 2015, but it'll happen. Now, InstaPaper is great for that. I can automatically send articles to my kindle in a daily digest. Instead of 500 tabs slowing down my PC I have one "newspaper" of my own choice on the Kindle per day. That is really neat. [deleted]

 > [^What ^is ^this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/99927) Be careful once you get up to between 7,000 and 10,000 tabs in onetab, it starts to bog down and will get positively unresponsive around 14,000 tabs and you'll have to uninstall onetab and reinstall to purge them. I extract the sqllite database of all the tabs and purge it around 8,000 tabs now, I can use an sqllite database client to browse through the links again later.  Same here. I've just ended up continually adding to one tab. All the things I want to continue reading "later"... Yeah that's all OneTab is really to me.   When I end up with 30 tabs open that aren't all that exciting but I am also afraid that I might need it sometime,  that's when I send it all to OneTab.  It's where tabs go to die.  Now now,  this is a safe space :)
 Exactly, you weren't going to read it anyway, so why have it in an active tab. Sometimes I have things there for weeks then move it all to getpocket. It's also much easier to find later as you can search and even tag the information.  Exactly and considering I use it with 3 browsers and saving anything from my phone, I can leave less stuff open.  I definitely never went searching for it... was an accidental discovery. :-) Use OneTab. Saves them from crashes and saves your computer's resources.  [deleted] That. That page is meta so it's safe*

*it is not safe And will have nobody to ever discuss it with :( I have some awesome epiphanies sometimes, and then realize either nobody cares or everyone else learned that when they were like 8 lol Basically I think you are using bookmarks correctly. Having 500 tabs open is the wrong way to do it lol Friend, are you okay? Maybe you need something beefier than SQLite. Do you actually read all your 8000 tabs or are you just some tab hoarder?  ("Must not close this tab,  what if one day I need it?  I can't throw it away,  it's a perfectly good tab!")
 I follow [deleted]

 > [^What ^is ^this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/39290) May they rest in peace. Like a closet: the place where all the clothes I forget I own live, while I wear the same three things that I keep in the dryer or on the floor. I'm worried the same thing will happen to my OneTab list as happens to the tabs I save as bookmarks: they pile up, since they're "out of sight, out of mind". But thanks for the suggestion anyway! It's so dangerous xD but yeah Firefox for me tends to be a little less stable... I am #$&(## perfectly #$&@:%!? fine!  Damn straight, but that's what onetab is built on, that's why it starts to fall over. My intention is to  consolidate all my link services out into a common format and bring it all  into something like solr for searching goodness   
  
Edit: I'll get around to it eventually ;)  Don't judge me!  You never know! I might need them! ;)   

But seriously, yeah I do read all of them, at least cursorily to determine their utility. I should mention that this process of massive numbers of tabs and saving them is mainly done as part of my working process... But I will maintain massive numbers of tabs while browsing for fun as well of course :)  but I digress... Anyway, this part of my working process with all the tabs is something I've adopted because I found that I'll always be finding something incredibly useful and never be able to find it again, so this way I potentially have these useful things in a captive population that I can search through - eventually I'll write some software to handle it all for me... When I get around to it :)  
  
Edit: I should add that it would probably take me the better part of 12-18 months to get to 8000 tabs in onetab so it's not like it's an overnight thing :)  They do pile up, but it's better. Doesn't make your computer slower, and makes it easier to search for them. You can favorite all open tabs to bookmark folders. Save by date, topic? Ah yeah,  I do the same but with bookmarks.   I have a catch all folder on my bookmark toolbar and whenever I see something that is worth saving I just drag it over.   When it gets full I rename it to the date and start a new one.
 Update: Today, my computer began swapping because I'd filled up my 16 GB of RAM with open tabs. Recalling this comment, I installed OneTab, and collapsed my open windows into it (unfortunately, you can't group tab groups, so though I can keep the grouping of tabs by window, I can't keep the grouping of windows by workspace). I now hold 305 tabs in OneTab. Thanks for the tip, I guess. Good idea 💡 :)
