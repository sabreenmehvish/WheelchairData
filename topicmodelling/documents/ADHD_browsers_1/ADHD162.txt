The Journey to a diagnosis seems to be a long hard road. ~My Story So far~ I have never really posted about the issues I face daily, I just happened to open up Reddit and see the post about Jessica's Ted Talk, I Keep up with her you tube channel and watched her Talk just a few minutes after it was released, so the topic perked my Interest. I posted a reply with my current situation and how I am "waiting to be diagnosed". Jondrethegiant asked if I had a post describing my specific journey. I have never really told anyone about the details of my life, my wife doesn't know about much of this because I still feel ashamed that I have wasted so much of my life doing nothing at all.  
But, just to get it out there... Here it goes!  
  
I have always had personal struggles within work and school, during grade school through High school I would daydream most of the time or sleep during class just because it was torture to listen to lectures that I was not interested in. To be honest I am not sure how I graduated High School. To this day I believe that they just pushed me through because they needed the numbers. I remember being told that I was failing every class and there was no way that I was going to graduate, and then somehow I ended up graduating.  
  
After high school I worked many, many jobs. I worked at every factory and fast food place in my home town, I would move to a new town usually staying with a friend or family member thinking "this will be it, something great will happen here!" Only to fall into the same trap of working at a job for maybe a week then quitting. Some jobs would last for a few weeks, there were a few that I walked out on before I even made it to lunch.
I did this for a few years, when a high school friend told me how great their college was and how I should come check it out. In hindsight It was way too easy to sign up for college, at the time I had no idea what i was getting myself into. I spent 2 years there, I was good for the first month or so and then eventually just quit going to class, I was more of just a social butterfly. I was able to get along well with everyone there so instead of class I would wander around and find things to do that Interested me.  
  
After finally quitting college I slipped back into my old ways again and bounced around for the next few years, I found a small group that was living off of the grid and they asked me to join them as long as i pulled my own weight. I am very knowledgeable about so many topics so I fit in perfectly with their little group. "Oh, the solar panels stopped working, let me just solder the negative wire back into place and Viola! Lights in the Barn again!" I was able to help with any of their electronics/electric projects, farming, manual labor, it was a place that required me to pull my own weight and at the time it was what I needed! My out of the box thinking helped them solve so many problems. I truly felt like I found a place where I belonged.  
  
After staying there for a little over a year my sister contacted me an told me that she had returned from Afghanistan and was going to have a baby girl! She asked If I wanted to move in with her and help her with the baby, I thought this would be an amazing experience so I said yes! She drove 13 hours to pick me up and I tried to help her out but mostly just made more work for her, laundry and housework is not my strong point.  
  
I went through a few jobs while living with her, slipping back into my old routine.. I eventually found a job as a cell phone repair technician. This was a pretty awesome job. I was able to chat with customers all day and utilize some of my electronics skills to repair their broken phones. I would solder in new charging ports, Replace broken screens, I was given free reign to make the customers happy. I worked there for about 3-4 months and I was doing great! An internal memo opened up saying that they were looking for someone to move into a position within their Cellular Data group. I was not nearly qualified, but I was given an excellent recommendation by my current boss so I turned in my resume. One month later I started my new job as a Cellular Data Administrator. This job fit me perfectly. I was given the flexibility to work on projects at my own pace. I could take as little or as much time to complete a project as needed as long I communicated my progress with my boss.  
  
I proposed to my wife and we married a year later! A year after that our Son was born, 4 years later a Daughter. I have recently been promoted multiple times within the same company, I was in a Sr Engineer position at one point for the Cellular side, I switched over to wired networking 4 years ago, and I have been loving it since. I am assigned opened ended projects that I can complete at my own pace. "usually i tend to procrastinate and have to quickly rush to meet the final deadlines." But it has been something I have been able to stick with!  
  
Until recently I thought that the issues I faced were just a part of who I was and that I just had to deal with them and nothing could change them. I googled some symptoms I was having after my wife and I began having more and more problems with our marriage the problems seem to orbit around what I do and do not do in our relationship. I found out that many of the struggles I have daily are symptoms of ADHD.  
I have been head strong in most ways, being able to accomplish just about anything that I put my mind to, If I am interested in a subject I can usually become extremely proficient with it very quickly. If i am not interested in it, It is almost impossible to read and retain anything.  
  
It was not until about 3 months ago that I began looking into ADHD, since then I have seen my primary care doctor and was given a date for an Initial interview and then for psychological testing. I completed the testing yesterday and I am waiting for the "Diagnosis" which is scheduled for November 15th. This entire process has been very difficult for me, many times I have wanted to call or have actually called to cancel my appointment and just deal with things but my wife has not let me quit. If i was doing this by myself I am sure that I would have cancelled and given up by now just because it is difficult, this also appears to be a big part of ADHD.  
  
I am currently 35 years old, thinking that I have ADHD is scary. It also makes me extremely sad inside, I feel as if i have wasted so many years of my life being unable to commit and follow through with anything important, If I could have been diagnosed earlier maybe I could have done more with my life!  
  
##Some daily struggles include:
  
**Listening to my wife without Interrupting her..** I tend to try to speed up our conversations by finishing her sentences and she hates this! I also talk over her about my own thoughts even while she is trying to tell me about her day.  
  
**Forgetting things when I leave the house or leave work.** I have a personal phone, a work phone, my wallet with my entry badge, air pods, car keys, watch. I had to come up with a little "pay my pockets" game that helps me to not forget things, I pat each pocket front and back. Phone,Phone,Wallet,Airpods .. Slap my hand to make sure my watch is there and then grab the keys and can leave!  
  
**Impulse buying**, I tend to see something flashy and want it, no I NEED IT! I will buy things that have no real reason behind them.   
  
- The other day I was reading something online about pies and how they are perfect for events. Its getting close to the end of the year, and we attend many events! I then stumbled into the world of Pie making, I made a list of everything I would need.. Rolling Pin, Measuring Cups, Food Processor supposedly this speeds up the dough making process so of course I needed one, Flour, Apples, Sugar , Etc etc... I went to the store that night and purchased everything to make the perfect Apple Pie!... Everything is still sitting in their original unopened boxes within the pantry. 

- I also needed everything to make a quad copter, a RC car, Everything needed to Airbrush D&D miniatures including an air induction system so that my house doesn't smell like paint! (I do not even play D&D).

- I needed so many laptops that I will never use and tablets that I will never touch, multiple eBook readers that I cannot sit down long enough to read.
 
- I needed a full exercise room in the basement for when I thought that I was going to become a Triathlete. Also a full pantry of supplements and protein powders. 

- I needed a complete Aquaponics system for when I was going to grow Tomatoes year round in my basement

- Speaking of gardening, I planted a garden this year, it turned out to be a box full of grass and random plants.

- I needed multiple 3d Printers that I was going to use to make so many things.
		
**Unloading the dishwasher,** I will become distracted and leave the dishwasher open and half unloaded, many times my wife has walked into our dark kitchen and smashed her shin into the open door. 

**I struggle with laundry,** I can make it through folding about a quarter to half a load before I usually completely loose interest and begin doing something else. Sometimes its much earlier than that and my wife finds a pile of laundry on the bed. 

**I have a hard time not burning the food I prepare for dinner** if I happen to wander out of the kitchen while cooking I will usually return to find a cloud of black smoke and our meal burned. 

*Sometimes when **mowing the lawn**, I will remember something else and stop mowing about halfway through. 

**I have a hard time remembering to eat.** I will usually begin working on something I am interested in and be completely involved with that task. My wife will usually find me hours later and try to break me out of my focus.

*I am usually late to work by 20-30 minutes every day.** I wake up at 5:30am but somehow I struggle to get to work by 8:00am, Its usually something that grabs my interest and then the next thing I know it is already after 8 and I have to rush out the door.

*While at work I have trouble staying on task**, when I open my browser and MSN.com pops up, its over.. Ofcourse I want to read about a wild wolf that stuns a town after everyone realizes that he just wants to be friends! or maybe.. Sure Mark Cuban: Please tell me why I should buy a two-year supply of toothpaste.

I am the guy in meetings that is always moving around in his chair, asking tons of questions, tapping or clicking his pen. I usually blurt out my thoughts while others are talking etc etc.. 

Hopefully you enjoyed the read atleast a little bit, maybe I kept it lively enough that some of you with ADHD made it through the whole post ;) 
I guess it feels better to have talked about my daily struggles a little bit. 

Do many of you struggle with the same things? 
How do you cope with your career? 
 Man! Great post! I can relate to pretty much everything here. As I guess most of this sub can. ADHD isn't easy on married life but it seems like your wife is pretty understanding. Some of my issues involve wanting to get into every little thing and trying to be the best at it overnight. And then once I feel like I've done that, I move onto something else. All kinds of hobbies, cooking ventures, home improvement projects, etc. My wife has seen me so hyped about things and then so low once I realized I'd spent too much money and bit off more than I could chew. I've gotten better at it by staying mindful of my behavior and checking myself before getting involved in something. But sometimes it still sneaks passed me.  [deleted] Thanks for the input!  
The diagnosis is more for my marriage, my wife and children than anything.

The wife and I have come to the conclusion that I cannot continue down the path that I am. We both agree that I seem to be more just playing out the role of being a father than actually getting in there and being one. It is not for lack of trying, but i spend most of the time in a fog. 
I wish it was as easy as you make it out to be to just change your ways. If sheer willpower alone could solve my problems I would be posting in the /networking forum right now instead of /ADHD.

Maybe I was not as clear as I should have been in the original post, I listed daily struggles, they are obstacles that I have to work to overcome every day, There are many more that I failed to list… I do overcome them every single day…. Some days I struggle more than others. I understand that it is what you have to do as an adult. But should it be this hard every day?

It is not like they are just bad habits that I can change after not doing them for 15 days straight, They are things I have tried to change for years if not my entire life but have been unable to.

As for my job, for the last 8+ years I have had a solid career that I have excelled at, I am the go to guy for anything Networking / Security / VOIP / Cellular / Data Center / PC  related.
I have an extremely flexible schedule, I have no fear of any repercussions for being late into work in the morning, but it does get to me when I try to make it in at the same time as my collegues but I always arrive after them, I wake up at 5:30am every morning and most of them wake up at 7:30 and make it into work before I do.

I have a salary position and no real schedule that is set in stone. I can come and go as a I please and this gives me great flexibility so that is not as big of an issue as it could be for someone in a different position.
 
As for studying, focus, and for wanting to be a genius student! I have been able to pass many difficult certification tests, most of which usually require many years of on the job experience and multiple semester college courses to pass, all while dealing with Focus issues. I have literally put at least a thousand of hours into studying at work and at home this year alone just to better myself, I make no excuses I just do it, does it take me longer to comprehend basic topics that most people can learn quickly? YES, Do I have to re-read the same page sometimes 10 times before I will remember any of it? YES, but I do it daily and make no excuses about having focus problems.

I accept how I am and how my brain works, but that is just not enough, I am the leader of a family and I can see that my actions are preventing me from being the father that I need to be. 

I hope that a diagnosis will open the eyes of my wife so she might see that I am not just trying to dodge my share of the house work, maybe she will see that I do really care about things like her birthday or our anniversary but I forget not because I am not listening but because its how my brain works. I hope this will allow her to dig into ADHD and understand me better for who I am.

There are alternatives to stimulant medication, which I wouldn't mind trying if the tests do come back and show that I have ADHD, 
but if a stimulant is the only thing that will give me the ability to sit on the floor and focus long enough to play G.I. Joes with my 5 year old son without feeling being bored or looking for a way out, you can be sure that I will take them. I have had my child stop me while we were playing and say “Daddy if you want to go do something else, that is ok. I can play by myself” He could tell that my brain was wandering elsewhere and I was not 100% there with him.

I lay awake many nights fussing at myself because I do not spend more time with my family, and because the time that I do spend with them I am usually in a fog and I rarely remember anything that was said or what we did. Not for lack of trying.

There is so much more to my story than me saying that I am trying to find an easy way to cope with all of the little things that prevent me from adulting like everyone else does.
