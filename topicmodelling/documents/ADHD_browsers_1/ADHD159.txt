Useful Chrome extension for tab hoarders TL;DR: If you're bad at closing browser tabs you can use [an extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb?hl=en) to allow you to search them.

---

I confess.  I am bad at closing tabs and good at opening them.  I google something and ctrl+click the top four links.  I drag tabs into new windows for multitasking then end up with multiple windows with dozens of tabs in. The tabs get so small the titles are unreadable, reducing efficiency.

It should have occurred to me sooner that there may be an extension to allow one to search through tab titles using a shortcut . Anyway, I found one called [Quick Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb?hl=en) and it works quite well.  It also has the ability to allow keyboard-only searching of bookmarks and recent history by padding the search term with leading spaces which is kinda neat.

Finally, it shows tab count of how many you have open which may be useful for self-control.  I'm on 48 right now which is probably average  :D  There are probably similar extensions for other browsers. I neeeed one of these for Chrome on mobile. ðŸ˜¬ That's where the real problem is. Sounds great for porn
