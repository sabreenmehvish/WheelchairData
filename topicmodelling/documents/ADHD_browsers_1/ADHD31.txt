Do you know of any browser productivity tools that helped you? I'm specifically looking for a chrome/firefox extension that blocks out the area below the mouse so I can force my eyes to stop jumping around the page, but anything will help This is something that would help tremendously, because I always look up documentation or an article or whatever, and the answer is right in front of me but I'll miss it because I just frantically scan the page and most likely just end up wasting my time or worse take the wrong information from it.


If it doesn't, anyone have any experience with browser plugin development that could throw one together? :)  have you checked out beeline reader?  it uses color gradients to help you stay on the correct line while you're reading.  I think there are similar things also.  http://www.beelinereader.com/ You could try using the windows magnifying glass. Its bulit into the OS so it should really work with any app. Did you just assume my operating system??? He did assume of course. He's trying to help with an alternative suggestion because what you asked is probably not been done yet.

Even on Linux there are magnifying glass type tools there. I use KDE Plasma and there is a screen magnifier in the graphic effects setup (similar to the Compiz type eye candy). I would assume there is also a similar tool in Apple OS X.

My suggestion would be to make the browser screen smaller, this is compatible across all operating systems Hahaha silly. On a serious note I use Speakit! It reads text out loud. Reading something myself while hearing it being spoken helps it stick for me. [deleted] Yeah was referring to the being triggered joke lol.  And I run mint KDE plasma and it is the most beautiful and intuitive OS I've ever seen LOL... I guess my 36 years of age makes me not sharp enough to follow the lastest memes... TBH, my ADHD doesn't give me a chance to grasp memes, I just can't be arsed to comprehend some of them.
