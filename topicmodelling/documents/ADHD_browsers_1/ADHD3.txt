I'm internet addicted. How do I stop? It's the single most destructive ADHD behaviour I have. There's several browser add-ons that will help block your websites, usually at certain times. I think there's apps for your phone as well. Some people just go back to a regular cell phone that doesn't have smart phone functionality.  I'd say that the best thing really is to use some windows 10 computer, this way you get a lot of possibilities and you get so many options, extensions, firewalls, DNS blockers, etc. So yeah.. try working offline, too If you can,  Instead of limiting yourself, what if you gave yourself a list of things that had to be accomplished before you could touch a device? I tried willingly going back to a regular cell phone. Didn't work. Thankfully, both of my smartphones are broken and I can't afford to fix them so I'm stuck on my Nokia E6.

I appreciate the advice. Are there any browser add-ons I can't simply bypass or uninstall? Because I know from experience that I'll do that. I mostly doubt that I'd comply with the list.

I make promises to myself, and then I find myself sitting in front of the computer wasting time again, as a result of a series of rationalisations that all somehow magically seemed like an unquestionably good idea at the time. Eh, that's tougher. Do you have someone else who can install it? Maybe one with a password?
