If you HATE reading your seriously need to check this chrome extention out. It works on me. This actually works and I have nothing to do with this company. Plus I'm pretty sure it is totally free. Go to [squirt.io](https://squirt.io) in your browser and find out how fast you are actually capable of reading. Add the shortcut like it says to do and it should work on any website. I personally love it.
