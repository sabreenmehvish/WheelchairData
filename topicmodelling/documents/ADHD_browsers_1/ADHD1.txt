Im trying to work but I keep opening browser tabs and remembering I need to work, and I've looked at that 20 times already today, and have to close them again. Ad infinitum. Its really bad today. Im just doing this over and over and over. Ive been on 20mg of Adderall XR for a couple months now and its...just doing nothing. Esp today. Or Im checking Facebook and I realized "UGH, Im on FB again! \*close FB\*" Without even realizing that I was on it in the first place. again, this has happened, like 6+ times today.
