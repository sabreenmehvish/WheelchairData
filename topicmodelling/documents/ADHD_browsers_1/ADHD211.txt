With school starting up again, share how you stay afloat. Share the tools and sites you use, any study techniquesâ€”whatever you think is valuable to your (potential) success in school! I love seeing how other people manage ADHD while barreling through the education system.

I use...

* **Google Calendar**: access on my phone makes it easy. Every deadline, meeting, and event goes in as soon as I know about it. It's on the bookmarks bar of my browser so I can always get to it easily, and my SO and I have a shared calendar that he inputs to, as well.
* **Google Keep**: for the "shit I'll have to remember that" moments, also phone accessible. Grocery lists, notes to call somebody, books I should read; everything goes in. You can put reminders on too, which has helped for time-dependent stuff.
* **HabitRPG/Habitica**: the gamification of my daily routine and to-do list makes finishing the crappy little tasks *so much more satisfying*. I use it to remind me of daily stuff like flossing while also getting sweet XP for things like working out and finishing school papers.
* **Google Sheets** (yes Google owns my life): after trying every to-do app in the world, I keep going back to spreadsheets. When I have a crazy couple of weeks coming up I make a column for each big task, put the dates in the rows, and plan backwards from when it's due to see what I'll have to do and then. Seeing everything laid out like that makes my brain stop stressing and going nuts, and it helps me get a grasp on what's coming up that I need to prepare for.

As for taking notes and stuff, I switch between Moleskine and laptop. I'm in grad school for the humanities so it's not as though there are a lot of equations to note, so I keep it to the stuff I find especially helpful or curious. I've started knitting in things like classes and presentations now, and that really helps me pay attention on the speaker instead of clean up my desktop. [deleted] Habitica literally saved my job I keep my self on a schedule thats more mental then anything. I have different music, belts, food, and clothing for each day if the week. Its the only way I can be structured in an unstructured world like college.  As far as studying goes, www.simplynoise.com (free browser based white/pink/brown noise generator) helped me a TON, cut's out audio distractions, perfect for chaty classrooms or other noisy situations, the brown also makes sleeping easy to boot. congrats! looks like you really have people in your corner! Why will your parents kick you off if you use it for ADHD? That's really fucked up. Seriously. Finishing up my Master's thesis this week *and I will get that freaking Mount Master achievement.* [deleted] Ah damn :/ sorry you have to deal with that. Hopefully this psych can help you out!
