Any success stories from people who have actually turned their life around? What were the most effective tools/ strategies in making a positive life change? The title says it all. Has anyone ever gone from a complete trainwreck to living a perfectly normal, balanced lifestyle?

Everyone with ADHD has felt at one time or another that their life is in complete shambles and has been completely overwhelmed about how to start turning it around and what to do first. When we're in a bad place, we are often bombarded with negative thoughts which can make our state of mind even worse. 

For anyone that has turned their life around, I think everyone on this sub would be inspired by learning more about your success story.

**What was your life like before you made changes for the better? What was the final breaking point? How did you start to turn it around? I'd also love to hear your top tools/ strategies for effectively juggling work, relationships, exercising, eating right, etc.**



*---My life is far from balanced right now but here are a couple of tools/ strategies I employed when I felt my ADHD was much better managed:*

1. **The 60 second rule**- Essentially I try to live by the life rule: if it takes less than 60 seconds, go ahead and do it. This applies to everything from household chores like washing my plate off after breakfast, quickly making my bed in the morning, putting my clothes **in** the hamper to simple things at work like answering a quick email. 

2. **Never leaving a room empty-handed**- I'm not great at remembering to do this and sometimes this can leave me even more confused because I forget why I left the room in the first place. When I have a habit of doing this, my house is usually a lot neater and more organized which in turn leads to my brain feeling less cluttered. 

3. **Google Chrome extensions**- I could make a full post on this but I am in Google Chrome 90% of my workday so Chrome extensions are a must. For some reason, using a desktop app or opening up another browser window just causes me so much confusion and gets me off task. In no particular order, here are some of my favorites: Black Menu for Google, Pi Reminder, ToDoist, OneTab, Toby, Noisli, Buffer, Pocket, Block Site, Infinity, timeStats. 

4. **The Eisenhower Matrix**- When I have so much to do, the constant bombardment of thoughts and ideas often paralyzes me from getting anything done at all. When this happens, I take all the upcoming tasks on my task list and categorize them into the different boxes in the Eisenhower matrix. 

5. **Getting to work 30 minutes earlier than everyone else**- I work in an open office which is a horrible work environment for me. If I don't set a plan at the beginning of the day, before everyone else gets there, I get so frustrated and upset by people being around me (whether they are being loud/ inconsiderate or not) that I am unable to get on the right track for the day. Getting to work before everyone else also allows me to take a couple minutes being mindful and preparing myself for what is to come instead of jumping into the chaos at 9 AM which causes me a lot of anxiety.

P.S. There doesn't seem to be a task manager app that also has an Eisenhower matrix component (at least not for Google Chrome). There are a couple for Android but that doesn't really help me at work. I know there are ways to use filters in ToDoist that kind of accomplishes this but I find it too cumbersome and time consuming and it isn't visual enough for me. Any developers out there that would be interested in creating this?!
 It all depends how you define success, doesn't it? 

I'm sure many would say that I've not achieve success, or that mine isn't a "real" success story. Many would also say that my live wasn't in shambles. And I would tend to agree. But my previous life wasn't working for me, and I was deeply dissatisfied with it.

I had move to another city to be with my then boyfriend (who needed to moved there to have shared custody of his son). I was hours any from my friends, from my family. My ADHD (undiagnosed) made that I couldn't hold down a job in the field I'd studied and started my career in (translation). I worked has a secretary, but always ended up loosing my job. I didn't feel like I was the lead character in my own life. 

And then, I got my ADHD diagnosis. And that changed everything.

I gave me the permission I needed to throw the "normal life plan and expectations" out the window. It gave me permission to stop trying to fit a mold that was clearly not made for me. It gave me permission to make my life work for me.

I stopped trying to look for a job and started working as a freelancer translator. The meds made sure I could produce quality work, and making my own schedule enabled me to work when my brain was at it's peak and go for a run when I needed a break.

I separated from my boyfriend and moved back to my home city to be close to my friends and family.

I've surrounded myself with people who love and support me. 

So now, I live on my own, run my own business. Sure, I don't make tons and tons of money, but I live comfortably and can afford many activities/hobbies and a little travelling.

But mostly, I've accepted that I'm weird, and I'm happy! Its not so much a success story (as I'm still struggling) but there have been good improvements.

Over the past few weeks, my personality has gone from that of a teenager to early twenties (I'm in my early twenties). Even my best friend has said that now, talking to me is like talking to my older brother (not different person but more mature). 

I also have avoidant personality disorder (think anxiety with hints of BPD) so I have avoided doing things all my life. I had no interests or hobbies or many people close to me cause I spent all my time dissociating from life, playing games all day and night and avoiding life in general. 

Three months ago, I looked into mindfulness and I've been able to locate my insecurities and inhibitions and work on them.

I've gained 7 kilos in past 2 months and have been much more out going. I have started to cook, eat and sleep properly. I went from being unable to speak to people (massive stage fright and social anxiety) to loving being on stage in front of a mic. I have started singing and have started to dance (one thing I've been too self conscious to do all my life).

Again, not so much a success story in my head cause I still have a long way to go but some success. i live by my (bullet-like) journal, and i open it BEFORE opening the laptop or phone.

edit: not that i've completely changed my life around, just a recent streak of seemingly impossible before progress.
vyvanse also helps me a lot more than addy IR did. About the to do list, have you tried My Life Organized PC?  That's amazing! Working from home is my ultimate end goal. Luckily, I'm in a career where that is certainly possible down the line if I put in the time and effort (easier said than done). I get so much anxiety at my current job simply because I have to interact with people on a day to day basis.  No I haven't. I have a Mac though. Is there only a PC option?
