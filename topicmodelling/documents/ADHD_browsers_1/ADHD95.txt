What are some signs that your meds are working? Sorry if this is in the faq, my phone browser isn't working properly at the moment so it isn't loading for me. I'm on a new med and I can't really tell if there's a difference from the last one. When I try to concentrate it works a little bit (as much as it can for someone who was diagnosed later on and wasn't given any tools to help can lol), but how do I know that this is "the one". I've tried adderall, strattera, and now vyvanse. From what I remember adderall helped so much, but the side effects were unbearable in my working conditions. I almost felt drunk and I work in a factory so that's no good for me. I'm not sure if the vyvanse is working or not since I was on strattera for about 2 years. I have a follow up with my dr next month and basically for adhd follow ups she says "so is it working" and I say "yes/no" and she either says "ok *walks out*" or "we'll raise your dose *walks out*." I don't know how to know if it's working. Any help is appreciated since my dr is absolutely no help at all. i haven’t tried vyvanse, so take this with a grain of salt(i’m on adderall), but i would take a break from the meds for 2 or 3 days if you can. after your short break you should DEFINITELY be able to tell if it’s working or not. vyvanse isn’t like strattera where you have to keep taking it to build up in your system(i was on strattera for about 4 days and couldn’t handle the side effects), so it’ll be fine if you take a short break. apologies if you’ve already tried this. if it’s really not working, maybe your dose is too low? Thanks for the tip! for sure! honestly it kinda sounds like your dose might just be too low. i took half of my regular dose yesterday and it was kiiiiinda working but i really couldn’t even tell, so it sounds similar to your situation I think it might be but I'm not totally sure since i don't have much info on how i should actually be feeling, ya know?
