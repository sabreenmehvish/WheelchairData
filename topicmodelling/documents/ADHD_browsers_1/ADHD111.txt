[Approved Academic Study] Memory and concentration in ADHD (Worldwide, 18+, diagnosed with ADHD) We are conducting a research project for the University of Wollongong requiring participants with ADHD and would love it if anyone here would be able to or would be willing to get involved. All participation is entirely voluntary and the project has approval from an ethics board :)

**What is it?**
We are interested in investigating how people with adult ADHD perform on computerised tasks measuring aspects of memory, concentration and attention. We will compare performance in these tasks between groups of people with adult ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and people without a mental health diagnosis. We hope to find out more about which aspects of these types of thinking differ between these different clinical conditions, which help to better understand, assess and treat them in the future.

**What does the study involve?**

We are looking for:

* Male or female participants

* We are at least 18 years old

* Who have had a diagnosis of adult ADHD from a health care professional and who are currently experiencing symptoms of ADHD

* Who do not have another mental health diagnosis (e.g. depression, psychosis, substance use disorder or OCD) 

* Who have not taken stimulant medication in the last 12 hours 

If you choose to participate in the study, you will be asked to:

* Complete online questions about you, your general health, and psychological symptoms (e.g. ADHD, anxiety and depression).

* Complete some online tasks which measure aspects of your attention and memory. These tasks need to be completed on a laptop or computer **not** a tablet or phone.

Participation should take no more than 60 minutes and is anonymous (your name will not be asked). You are welcome to take breaks in between tasks (just leave your browser open!). Please ensure you read the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form prior to starting.

How common is having ADHD with no other psychiatric condition? Untreated ADHD often causes people to develop anxiety and depression (among other things), so that's probably a very common overlap. I was just diagnosed with ADHD (severe, combined) and havenâ€™t been medicated yet. However, I have experienced an uptick in anxiety in the past two weeks. I donâ€™t know if that disqualifies me (I suspect so), but I just wanted to check. 

Also, isnâ€™t sampling only the ADHD people who donâ€™t have comorbid disorders going to give a skewed result? I would suspect that the more severe cases would be more likely to have comorbidities.  I will get around to it later....

No, not really, I don't qualify.  not sure if i'm completely dumb but i didn't have a clue what was going on in that card sorting bit

also fucking hell it goes on for a long time sorry for ruining your results but i just had to spam click one of the letters felt like i was being trolled

update: got to the grid bit with the marker and had to drop out rip To my understanding. ADHD diagnosed early in children as adults often experience less anxiety and depression. While people who did not get diagnosed early and are as adults much more frequently report anxiety and depression. The belief being that anxiety acts as a coping mechanism or result of failures caused by the deficits of untreated ADHD. Depression being the same as Anxiety in the cause. 70% of people with ADHD have a comorbid disorder, so I suppose your answer is 30%. It is quite rare to have ADHD without another psychiatric condition, and unfortunately that means that the majority of people who would love to participate won't be able to. However, we hope that this requirement will allow for a greater understanding of ADHD individually without the influence of other psychiatric conditions.  I was going to ask the same thing. I won't be able to participate because I was diagnosed with moderate depression before (stemming from undiagnosed and untreated ADHD), and have suspicion of undiagnosed anxiety (for the same reason). It feels like a large swath of this sub would be precluded, unfortunately. I'm sorry to hear about your anxiety. If you do not have a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder then it is fine for you to participate. However, if you do, unfortunately you won't be able to participate. 

We hope that by only examining ADHD on its own without another comorbid diagnosis that performance will not be influenced by another diagnosis. However, you are correct in that a limitation of the research may be that we are not capturing the most severe cases of ADHD. 

Thanks for your interest in our research :)  I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately research often requires strict criteria such as these that disqualifies a lot of people. I wish you all the best in the future! Yes the card sorting task can be tricky and unfortunately many of the tasks in the study are required to go on for multiple trials. I thank you for your interest though and your willingness to attempt the study :)  That's true! Diagnosed last year at 28; deep in the therapy mines digging out all the trauma ðŸ™ƒ and of the 30% like me only 30% can probably get through it to the end without medication... Same here, diagnosed ADHD as an adult and later with an additional helping of moderate depression. Shame I'd like to participate.
