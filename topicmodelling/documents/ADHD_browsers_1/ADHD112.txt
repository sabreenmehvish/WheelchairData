Cooking/baking is a good ADD Hobby It occurred to me this morning as I was skimming through my 30 or so recipes I have saved in my browser just how great cooking and baking are for someone (including me)with ADD:

- recipes are small tasks that are easy to accomplish, you can pick recipes suitable to your skill and attention span.

- you can be sloppy, cut corners but you are forced to finish, it is an accomplishment and often its memorable. People remember you for it.

- a dinner is easily broken down into subtasks (dishes) and dinner itself can be as simple as you want, people like my one pot meals.

- you can easily adjust, some days I can barely get the effort and attention together to fry an egg but  I can often pull off a dinner party for 8. My family doesn't care, they love breakfast for dinner.

- it's very socially acceptable to be in the kitchen cooking alone (I cook alone) because of the payoff of dinner.

- I find I hyperfocus over some things based on my obsessions which shift, so recently I have been on an ice cream making kick. Before that was making pasta.
I love technique and equipment so I zoom in on that.

- unless you have very picky friends and family you can indulge your whims and obsessions, I have something like 30 recipes I googled and bookmarked that I may or may not make soon. I will pass recipes past people but %95 of the time they love to let me indulge my whims.

- the deadline of having to have dinner ready for people helps me get it done.

- if you dont like that kind of pressure then baking might be the way to go. I will bake in the morning at my leisure 

- overall both cooking and baking can fit anyones level of expertise, everyone should learn the basics to feed yourself and you can slowly grow from there in many different directions or as complex or as simple as you want.

- baking tends to be a more exacting task,less room for cutting corners or sloppiness. I do like baking bread, brownies, scones etc less complicated baked goods but find cake decorating to be too fussy for me.

- cooking is generally more flexible and tolerant of mistakes although if you forget salt or put twice as much in people do notice.


Pitfalls and how to avoid them

- I can only focus on one thing at a time so I wont have 5 things actively cooking at the same time. I either make things in advance sometimes a day or two if it's a dinner party or I will write out an order of cooking.

- it's worth mentioning separately but if you are worried about loose ends then write it down.
So for a dinner party I will create a menu, shopping list then an order and timing  of which I am preparing the meal. If I feeling especially overwhelmed I will draw up a list for a regular dinner.

- time assessment is important, I can whip together a dinner pretty fast put if I had a long day at work then I am not in a good state to pull off much, many times I just said screw it and ordered pizza. So if it's a bigger dinner like a dinner party then I plan on the whole afternoon to pace myself and not feel overwhelmed.
I will shop in the morning so I can still have the afternoon free. 

Cooking as an occupation.

- I had considered becoming a chef, as I mentioned above the work has inherent short term deadlines which are good but ultimately I decided against it because kitchens under a french style organization are too rigid and inflexible. And as you may have noticed in my comments above I doubt I could sustain the day in day out short term deadlines .
I would love to hear from others on this.

I would love to hear from anyone else about my comments and their experience. I love cooking! 

I love having a bunch of stuff going at once. Throw something in the oven then chop a bunch of stuff, throw it in a pan, go back to chopping more stuff and going back and forth between everything to see how itâ€™s coming along.  I LOVE cooking...chopping, sauteing, whatever. No recipes usually, though I do like reading recipes for inspiration.

I used to cook when I skipped my classes in college/grad school/etc. I don't think I would like doing it professionally, but it's a great hobby for me. 

For a long time I thought about starting a food blog or something like that, but that never quite materialized... Another cooking enthusiast here! Bread making for the win for me! 

Lucky i grew up poor in the country so learned to make simple loaves as a kid. Hated it then, used to swap my homemade sandwiches for white bread at school. Hippy parents. 

Now i chill out by nurturing myself making clean sugarfree fresh bread. And the smell.... 

The beauty is, making your own clean healthy bread from good ingredients has so many benefits. 

And yes, i understand about gluten :)

I also just love cooking because the most creative solutions occur to my mind (and sometimes they work) I do all the cooking in our house. I have my own binder of recipes I've printed off (because nothing beats the tactile sensation, plus i can write all over them). I also have a bunch of spice mix recipes and sauce recipes. 

Side note: I used to always forget to make sides, particularly rice. I would get all the way to being ready to serve dinner and my wife would ask "did you make the rice" and well you know how that goes. Yes, lo ve making bread too, I will have to check out that doc.   Me too and generally I seem to want to make only 2 maybe 3 things. If it's a dinner party I have to write it out.
