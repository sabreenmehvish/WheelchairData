Any tips for someone with ADHD about to start Uni? I made it! After losing residence because I was too busy dealing with multiple e-mail accounts and not actually knowing what e-mail went where, after dealing with the Uni to find a spot and just straight out getting a loan to rent a place nearby I finally did it!

I had kind of a disastrous start to college and it hasn't even begun yet, but now that I've managed to somehow fix everything (idk how haha) I want to really not start on the wrong foot.

What are some tips and things you would recommend me? I installed Moment on my phone and removed everything that can distract me and even installed chrome extensions on my laptop to disable sites that can distract me (I'm on a different browser right now so I'm cheating). I bought a Mac to prevent myself from playing games. I'm currently at a University, in my junior year and i've learned a lot over the past 2 years through trial and error. Unless you are medicated, do not try to go to the library for ours on end to study- you'll just end up getting very distracted and hit a wall after a while.

I also suggest getting a planner, one that has both the monthly view, and a daily view with each hour of the day written out. It is easier for me to visualize when I have something going on, like an appointment or a class if I can write it down in my planner hour by hour. Also, each night before you go to bed I recommend writing down all the things you need to get done the next day that way you wake up and know exactly what you need to do and don't have to waste time thinking about it.

If your Uni has student services for disabilities, contact them and see what benefits you might be able to get such as extra test time, preferential seating in classes, and note takers to take notes to supplement the ones you may take.

Good Luck, and you've got this!
