Tip for working on computer Maximum 5 tabs open at one time. Less is better. Seriously.

Just close your browser now, then open what you really really need for what you are supposed to do.

Oh, and get out of reddit while your at it. I will do that in just 5 seconds... :) Oh wow, I'm supposed to be doing a powerpoint and touching up a google doc right now and I just counted 11 tabs, 4 of them being reddit and one wikipedia Yes! Your browser is not a to-do list, and you're not as good at switching between them as you think you are. :)  I use [xTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xtab/amddgdnlkmohapieeekfknakgdnpbleb?hl=en) to limit the number of tabs I can have open at a time. 

By default it will replace your oldest tab when you create a new one, but I set mine to just refuse to open a new tab until I've closed one. hmmmm....*looks at all 3 moniters with each having several tabs*
 Nope, I need all 20 of these tabs.

Just kidding, I will get around to closing all of the open tabs I no longer need sometime next friday. Maybe. Get an ad blocker too if you do web research  I only have a shocking 3 tabs open right now ( compared to my usual 15-20), but I also have Steam open along with three word documents. I am also putting off the grad school application hullabaloo I should be doing. 

Alrighty. I need to close my browser. Love it! Now I need a version for Chrome on Android for which no extensions are possible.
