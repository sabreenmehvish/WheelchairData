Stayfocusd Just sharing a recent discovery I had.  It's a google chrome extension that allows you to block out or restrict your amount of time spent on certain websites at certain times of the day.  For example-  I only allow myself 30 minutes of time on reddit and facebook from the hours of 8-5 there's tons of settings, but you can't change anything until 24 hours after you request the change.  Of course you could just use your phone or another browser, but its a nice reminder that you are wasting to much time.  Also stops a lot of the mindless browsing that tends to happen throughout the workday.   I'm terrible. When I get tired/uncaring enough I just delete the extension and no more restriction.

Just did it 5 minutes ago to get on facebook lol. 

I also use the mobile app! I use it, but uh, it doesn't work in incognito mode.  Knowing it doesn't work in incognito mode means that's how I visit most of my blocked sites anyway. This could be exactly what my college-aged son needs.  Thanks!
 Ha! Its certainly nit a replacement for self discipline, but certainly a reminder of how much time you've wasted on sites you shouldn't be on.   ... and now you've just given everyone the cheat code ... I bet you can add it to incognito. I had to specifically enable adblock for incognito with that little check mark but...then...I'd actually be productive!??  actually I'd probably end up getting the apps on my phone because I have no self control, haha
