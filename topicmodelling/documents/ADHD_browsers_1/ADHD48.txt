Is there a preferred app or app in general that tracks both browser and app usage for tracking time wasted online? For example want to track my browser and my messenger app
Anyways thank you  Rescuetime is great  I meant I don't mind paying for it but anyways I just want to know that the features advertised with it are free if not I'm sure it I hope it's known in losing so much productive time It's free.  There are paid features.  I've looked at them, I honestly don't see the value.  But if you're looking for something cross-platform (computer, phone, tablet) that will give you a breakdown of how you're spending your time, it's great.  I love it.
