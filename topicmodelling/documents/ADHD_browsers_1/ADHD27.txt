ADHD and Chrome Browser Tab Management u/minerofowls posted a couple months ago with [a great list of tips and tricks for managing ADHD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/6ly1li/the_big_helpful_post_of_strategies_that_i/). I figured I could supplement his post with this tip.

------------------

I'm one of those people; my chrome browser constantly has at least two dozen tabs open as I bounce around between tasks/distractions on my computer. Having so many open, even over several different windows, often prevents me from keeping track of which tabs I need for different tasks (and how to prioritize these) and which ones I'm done with but have left open.  More tech savvy folks will also know about Chrome's problems with resource and memory management as the number of open tabs builds up.

I've started using a tab management extension called Toby (linked [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toby-for-chrome/hddnkoipeenegfoeaoibdmnaalmgkpip?hl=en)) which I've found very useful to help me limit the number of tabs I have open at any time while also keeping track of ones I might need to return to later. This has really helped me keep focused on the task at hand without getting distracted by other things I can take care of later.

This is certainly not the only option out there, and [this article](https://www.techspot.com/article/1361-chrome-tab-management/) reviews some of the many other ones for Chrome that might fit your individual needs better. While I exclusively use Chrome, I'm sure there are similar solutions for other browsers (hopefully users of other browsers can share those in the comments) and indeed there may be something to be said about switching browsers altogether. Hopefully this will help others who also have this tab management issue. I have trained myself to have a strict, ten tab limit...

...but I now have Chrome, Chrome Beta, Firefox and Vivaldi running at the same time. Each with ten tabs

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I've all but given up on attempting to limit myself to a particular number of tabs. I use Tabs Outliner so I have a Windows Explorer-style view of my tabs. Makes it easier to organize and know at a glance which tabs are relevant. It also lets me "close" some tabs out but keep them in the list so I can come back to them when they're relevant. All I can do is start shutting some down when I get so many that they are too small for me to tell which is which. I use tree style tabs vertically. It allows me to see more of the titles so I know what a web page was about even when I have hundreds of tabs open. Links open under other tabs creating subtrees so it's easy to clean up and close a whole tree when the topic is irrelevant. When I have 20 reddit comment threads open, I close them all and start a new tree.  that's the exact problem I had! Toby replaces your new tab page and makes it really easy to see all your open tabs and close or archive them as necessary That sounds interesting and definitely like a system I could use, how does that work?
