I went to a mental health clinic expecting to be either told I'm lazy, have a personality disorder, or just need to change certain simple things, but was told I may have ADHD I live in Japan, the land of limited mental health care. I am also addicted to alcohol, impulsive behaviors, or any 'escape' from my mind, struggling to quit for years (with minor successes along the way), and feel extremely up and down, often.

Recently starting therapy, I was encouraged to go to a mental health clinic (again, after my last attempt resulted in being told I have a case of struggling to integrate into the culture so I'm a bit melancholic). I finally found the courage to do so today.

After 2 hours of personal questioning, they told me to come back in a week for testing specifically for ADHD. I realize now my perception of ADHD was completely wrong - my first image is a hyper kid who won't sit still and gets bad grades because they can't focus or just want to do something else. Well, I was a hyper kid but I sat still when I had to, I did all my homework on time and excelled academically. I was afraid of any authoritative figure being mad. But once I left my parents home, once I left the typical school system, I basically stopped being able to do anything well or caring for myself, unless I was being watched, taken care of, or had others relying on me (But me relying on me? NEVER. No control of myself).

I contacted my father to see his thoughts on the idea... And it was like a light bulb went off in him. I only excelled academically because I had good exam taking skills, and I probably spent 3x as much time studying and learning as my peers because rather than focusing I would rely on repetition to remember. I am good at keeping a front that looks like I have it all together, but inside I'm a mess. I always have at least 20 tabs open in my browser. I can't do one thing at a time. I was a good multitasker years ago but now my efficiency is much much worse. It's making sense now.

I cant keep my minuscule flat clean or tidy. I forget to shower or brush my teeth sometimes. I love planning things but never follow through. I will abuse any substance that takes me out of my mind. My interests have always come with intensity and then suddenly disappeared (except for one hobby which has stuck nearly 3 years - with up and downs). I have had 3 different jobs in the last year. I forget what I had for breakfast or where I left my keys. I forget things I need to do for work, or what time my shift changes. I once threw my wallet in the garbage by accident. Right now, my bicycle is lost - I can't remember where I left it, it must have been near home so I forgot I cycled and walked home. I thought all these issues were a result of alcohol abuse, but I now realize they started even before the alcohol, but just got worse with it.

This is not a question I guess. I dont even have a diagnosis yet, as I'm going for more intense testing next week. But... I wanted to write this somewhere. And see if any support or suggestions can come my way. Thanks.

TL;DR: Told I might have ADHD, suddenly making realizations about my behaviors when previously I was convinced I'm lazy and disorganised and maybe have a personality disorder. Well, only a professional can diagnose you, but those are some very relatable characteristics for many people here. Even without a diagnosis there are a lot of great ideas floating around here about how to manage these things besides or without medication, often on a problem by problem basis. It worth wandering around the post history for some ideas if you are interested. Welcome! Hello, I was recently was diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD after testing. I have struggled my whole life.  In a few days I will be 60 years old.  My business of 27 years has been slowly "falling apart."  I saw a psychiatrist for many years that labeled me as being depressed.  A long list of drugs were prescribed and tried with no success and resulted with a "zombie like state."  It was not until I demanded to be taken off everything that he prescribed that I cleared up. The idea of possibly having ADD or ADHA came to me after seeing and "infomercial" on TV with some Doctor selling "brain scans" for people with it.  I had prayed my heart out that morning, for an answer or direction to help me.  It was only because I was in a beach house with the cable shut off for the season that came across the infomercial.  Today my marriage is hanging on by a thread and she said she has always know that I had ADHD!!!!! I have had ideas and things I have wanted to implement with my business but never reach the finish line with them.  I was prescribed Adderall recently and felt better and was able to focus, but also was very easily agitated and could feel my blood pressure go up, when I found myself very angry over things that I really should not have been.  Vyvanse was next prescribed at 20 mg, then 30 mg.  I was getting confused and unable to concentrate.  I would be in Home Depot walking the isles trying to figure out what I needed or that I was trying to remember what I thought I was forgetting. I also felt very racy and caffeinated and can't stand that feeling.  I did get the euphoria feeling for a while, but that is gone.  Caffeine does not agree with me at all, and I do not take it in any form.  The vyvanse was backed off to 20 MG, but I still feel the same as when on 30 mg.  Today I took two thirds of a 20 mg capsule with the hopes that the racy & caffeinated feeling would subside, but it is only slightly better.  I am wondering if others have had similar experience on Vyvanse with such a small does.  My wife cringes every time a new drug is prescribed because she has seen what has happened to me in the past.   Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank you. Sounds like you're in the right place.  Best of luck in the future. As someone who jumps between about 6 different hobbies, I'm rather curious as to what the one hobby you've been able to stick with is. i can't get over how much this sounded like my story. I've lost my car before... for hours. THIS is very relatable.. especially the abusing shit to get out of my head.. And not being able to do anything to care for myself besides when I'm being watched / looked after or others relying on me...

In those situations I'm the most responsible and organised version of me.. But it all dies the minute I'm left in my own company pretty much. Is this a fear of others finding out how you truly are? It's interesting that I find motivation from being observed.  In America / USA and thus in English one of the books for ADHD written for people with disorders to be used in conjunction with medical professionals (aka not instead of doctors but to augment doctors, is this book title.

#You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy?! ^(A Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder.)

^(I am making this comparison for other ADHD books I read and familiar with are meant for doctors and scientists and medical experts teaching similar doctors the best way to treat ADHD and other disorders and update them on the most recent science.  This book I just mention is meant for people with no medical background and they actually have that disorder.)

I find that title of the book one of the best titles for Adult ADHD books if I were to pick a title for an ADHD book if I were to write a book and give it a title myself (since I know so much about ADHD due to self research after being diagnosed and I want to help connect other people with the doctors and other good science on how to treat ADHD.)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So I had a horrible shitty day, a 0 out of 10 day, one of those days you would not wish on anybody friend, family, and even enemy.  So part of my brain is fried and my memories and analysis are off, **its been that bad of a day you think you are part insane for you are EMPTY and exhausted**.  So let me say this before I say what I am saying next.

 * But, I can't remember if this was one of the books I would recommend in the top 5 ADHD books if I were to recommend someone, or if it would be in the top 10 ADHD books I would recommend someone recently diagnosed with ADHD.

My brain is so fried right now I can't think or make lists so understand I am just giving you an emotional answer but not a logical analytical answer for I read lots of these books and I have opinions but I do not trust my memory right now.  I remember being impressed by this book I just do not remember if it was impressed it was #4 or #5 on the list, or more like #9 or #10.

Books that would be in the top 3 or 4 would be stuff by Dr. Barkley, the Driven to Distraction Authors (Dr. John Ratey and Dr. Ned Hallowell), Gina Pera those 3 definitely are other authors I recommend.  I love and adore Dr. Brown and think he is a great public speaker but his books are more dry so some people do not relate personally.  There are another 1 or 2 people I would recommend but my memory is shot and I can't remember if this book by Kate Kelly was one of those 1 or 2 people or was it some other authors for I do not have all the authors I can reflexly give out names and say BUY THIS.  But those 3 authors I gave earlier are definitely BUY THIS and I can't remember if this book was part of the BUY THIS category or just Recommend Highly or Recommend Mediumly.

Matt / Roland00 is rambling for his brain is shot, I had a horrible day and I need a hug. So understand right now I am an emotional wreck.  If you have 1 bad day a year where you are not yourself understand that is me right now.  Normally I am far more collected and the rest of this reddit can say and attest to that and say this is not usual /u/Roland00 (and lets make this about me, if you recongize me and you recongize this is not my normal behavior please tell /u/Aicchan since he is new and does not know me and he just has to trust what I am saying by faith.)

But what you describe is typical ADHD behavior for a subgroup of ADHD people.  Some ADHD people are the hyperactive sterotype, but there are other styles of ADHD and you just perfectly describe another style of ADHD and this is my style so understand what you just wrote is something I could have wrote both my past and my present (I was diagnosed ADHD at 28 as an adult.) but I would only write it on those other 364 days a year, and right now because I feel like a mess my style of language is kinda different =P

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now there are other disorders that can produce this type of behavior not just ADHD.  Some are mental disorders things like autism, depression, bipolar (certain styles), ocd, and I can go on and on.  But also other disorders not mainly neurotransmitter related but impact neurotransmitters by being neuromodulators things like hormonal disorders (thyroid and others), sleep apena, vitamin B12 and other vitamin B deficiency.

What I am saying is other things can look like ADHD for all those other disorders are impacting the same neurotransmitters involved with ADHD but another chemical is then modifying another brain chemical, for example a hormone can enhance or diminish the effects of norepinephrine and dopamine (two neurotransmitters involved with ADHD.)

So what I am saying is get a proper diagnosis, we can't tell you if its ADHD or not, but what you are describing is very common ADHD behavior and even if its not ADHD it does not mean you are crazy or lazy but there may be another problem.  For example vitamin B is involved in the production and regulation of the same neurotransmitters implemented with ADHD.  So we are talking neurotransmitter dysfunction that produces similar symptoms but different causes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now what I am saying is even if its not ADHD it may be some other disorder.  If you are fearful of a misdiagnosis of ADHD when you really have another disorder understand most of these other disorders that are hormonal, autoimmune, nutritional, sleep based etc have tests to rule them out and many of these conditions are much rarer than ADHD.  For example vitamin B12 deficency is something that is QUITE OBVIOUS on a simple blood test, many of these other hormonal things quite obvious with a simple blood test, autoimmune disorders will show up your immune system chemicals on a blood test are out of whack and then you are refered to a specialist who figures out are you just sick or do you have an autoimmune disorder that would make these immune chemicals be much higher than normal.  Same thing for sleep disorders your doctor asks questions about sleep and has questionaires and if you score above a certain thershold where you may have a low to medium probability of have certain types of sleep disorders they refer you to a specialist and rule these things out.

Now if you have another mental disorder instead of ADHD that is the reason you are doing the followup appointment  in a week even though the person you saw is quite convinced ADHD may be a seriously likely cause of your symptoms, your doctor is doing everything right and doing followups and more detailed questioning to rule out those other problems.

But what I am saying is congratualations I do not know if you have ADHD or not, but if its not ADHD many of these other problems have treatment, and often in situations like yours you are not lazy, you are not crazy, you are not a person that has some moral flaw, often you have a biological condition that makes it harder to do the things you honestly care about and so on.

#So welcome to the family even if we are not sure you are ADD/ADHD or if you are a distant cousin that has similar problems but not caused by ADHD but something similar that is biological.  ^Smiles at the distant cousin part =P This video is not to diagnosis you ADHD but to illustrate to a person that ADHD is not just the sterotype of ADHD and to show and explain how ADHD impacts all areas of life and many areas people do not realize.  It is a lecture by Dr. Thomas E Brown of Yale a very respected ADHD expert.  Now the whole video is AWESOME but make sure to watch the first 33 minutes which is so key to a person diagnosed with ADHD or even a different disorder of attention if its not specifically ADHD related but caused by something else that disrupts attention.

(And vimeo is like youtube but with no commercials and a little more professional due to this) Kudos to all y'all who read that 10 page, double space, mla format essay. After the first sentence I dozed off   I also did, like, super duper well in exams throughout high school and into college so I feel your pain on that... and sure, yeah, a lot of this other stuff sure sounds ADHDish to me too. By the way, it does look now, according to the latest science, that people who get medicated for it do see their brains start to look more and more like "normal" non-ADHD people. So maybe it won't even be permanent! Sorry I don't have anything productive to add, but I can relate so incredibly much to your post. I hope you have an accurate diagnosis (if you get one) and that you can learn how to manage everything. You can do it!  Perhaps you could talk to your doctor about non-stimulant medications that are used for ADHD, such as [atomoxetine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine) or [guanfacine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine). Hi, I do get the "racy" feeling with Vyvanse sometimes, and I'm on 40mg a day. Were you checked over for heart issues? My doctor would not even write the prescription until we made sure I had no heart issues or abnormalities. 
That said, Vyvanse is an extended release drug because of the coating on the capsule - breaking it open gives you the whole dose at once, so doing that might not be helping. Exploring other drugs is certainly an option. But it helps me to remember that drugs are just a tool, not a cure, and they need to be used mindfully if they're going to do what you want them to.
I would try some kind of quick relaxation practice in the morning, before or after you take your meds. This has really helped me get the full benefit and minimize the side effects of Vyvanse. I like mindfulness meditation, cheesy as it may sound. Picturing your thoughts as leaves floating by on a river, and so on, whatever imagery you like. It really helps me, and helps my Vyvanse do what I want it to do!  Pole dance/aerial fitness. Maybe because it is so versatile, and because I'm very attached to the people/community I do it with. Me too... What was it??  ***hugs*** One last thing, ADHD treatments in Japan have many of the ADHD drugs avaliabile in the USA, but some of the drugs you do not have (for example doing this from memory Amphetamine such as Adderall, Vyvanse, and Dexedrine are not avaliabile for the laws in Japan do not allow it.  Part of this has to do with history and amphetamine abuse was far bigger problem in Japand than it was in the US during certain decades, part of this is cultural.)

But some of the medicines  in Japan that can be used for ADHD we do not have in the US or Europe.  I Need to make a list for I do not have this all from memory.  For example in Japan you have a 3rd kind of stimulant that is very effective for ADHD that we do not have in the US (but we used to have, it is a long story not for tonight.)  So in Japan besides having Methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin, and other brands in the US) you also have another very effective stimulant for ADHD called Pemoline / Betanamin in Japan (it was called Pemoline and other names in the USA when it was available in the USA a decade ago, once again I can explain the long story).

You also have some nonstimulants we use for ADHD that are not available in the USA but are available in Japan and if I recall some of these nonstimulants used for ADHD are also in some european countries but not all.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Why I am bring this up?  Well most ADHD people respond well to 

* Atomoxetine / Strattera (between a 60 to 70% success rate depending on the study, note this success rate is measured at 3 months and not a shorter period for the drug takes that long to fully kick in but you may see positive effects as soon as a few weeks usually minor improvements as soon as 3 weeks but the improvements get bigger in time and level off at about 3 months), and 

* Methylphenidate (about a 65% success rate, some people respond well both to Strattera and Methylphenidate but some respond well to only 1 drug)

* And a drug not available in Japan called Amphetamine such as Adderall and Vyvanse about 70% of people respond well to this, and if you try both Methylphenidate and Amphetamine 85% of ADHD people respond well to at least one of these 2 medicines, for some respond well to both and some respond to just 1 of these drugs, and some people have to try a nonstimulant such as Strattera.

But my point is finding the right medicine is trial and error and if you do not respond well to the first medicine do not give up hope you just try another medicine that treats ADHD differently that we have good science this other meds also treat ADHD.

So not counting Pemoline since we no longer have it in the US since 2005, we have 7 classes of ADHD meds in the US that treat ADHD in different ways and are different classses of drugs.  In the US we usually try the Methylphendiate and Amphetamine stimulants first, and then follow up with Atomoxetine if you do not respond to the 2 stimulants first, and then we try the other 4 classes of ADHD meds if you do not respond to Amphetamine, Methylphendiate, Atomoxetine.  But what I am trying to say is your doctor will have a systematic system where we try this med first, most people see a massive improvement and if you do not or the side effects are bad you try the next on the list, and it is trial and error till you find the best med.

But I am bring this stuff up for Japan has some differences in what meds are available but there is still a systematic list and so on.  And in some ways you are lucky to have options we do not have in the USA and also vice versa for Pemoline and some of the other nonstimulants in Japan you have treat ADHD differently than the 7 options we have in the USA and vice versa.

Rambling Matt / Roland00 is almost over =P (remember I had a long day) but what I am trying to say is you have so many options to treat ADHD in Japan if what you really has is ADHD and so on.  And if your doctor does not know all the options but he knows the best 2 or 3 options and those do not work do not despair and do not give up just ask for a specialist.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**I am not a doctor or medical expert.** I can't tell you which med will work best in you, all I can do is quote and link medical journals that have looked into this so if you want input from me I am not going to say try this med but instead just provide a journal link where you can print the article out and then talk to your doctor and ask does this med may make sense in me.  Even if the journal article says this is an option in most ADHD people it may not be a wise option in you if you have specific coexisting conditions in the brain but also stuff with the body where it may make a body condition better or worse and so on.

Rambling Matt is thinking sleep sounds good.  But good luck and enjoy the sunrise this morning in your beloved Nippon, while I wave hi across the world in my beloved USA

=D Thanks for replying.  I will look into those.   My 8yo DS was diagnosed ADHD at age 4 1/2. Was put in Biphentin, then Concerta. We took him off 54 mg Concerta at 49 lbs and 4'2" just after his birthday. He is now on Intuniv 2mg (guangacine) and weighs in at 60 lbs at 4'3". He wasn't eating or sleeping much. In 3 weeks we see how that is going. Off meds he gets frustrated and suffers from explosive aggression. Doctor said we may have to try him on atypical antipsychotics (Abilify), and possibly combined with Concerta at a lower dose. Luckily the Abilify counters the appetite suppression and insomnia caused by stimulants.

Look into Intuniv and Strattera. Non stimulants that work on the venters of the brain that control attention and impulse control.  >Vyvanse is an extended release drug because of the coating on the capsule - breaking it open gives you the whole dose at once, so doing that might not be helping.

This is incorrect. Vyvanse is just [lisdexamfetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine) powder in a standard capsule. All the lisdexamfetamine is immediately available when ingested, it is not an extended release formulation. The reason why it works *like* an XR formulation is that lisdexamfetamine is inactive. When it has been absorbed, it is converted to its active form dexamfetamine, but this process is rate-limited, so it doesn't happen all at once. It doesn't matter whether you swallow the capsule or open it and mix the powder in water. Even if you snort it you won't feel it any quicker. Takes the hug and just rests, it was not that horrible of day for 80% of it, but during the last 20% I became exhausted, and sensory overloading and this is a big deal due to my sensory issues ( a common comorbidity with ADHD.) 

Effectively I had something like an Autistic Meltdown (though I am not autistic but I possess many of the traits for ADHD can increase many of the coexisting conditions / commorbidities that are associated with autism, furthermore autism increases the chance of having ADHD as well.)  But unlike the famous Autistic Meltdowns that most people have seen on a tv it is more like a shutdown, where you just fall apart and everything just seems broken and suddenly you just become an emotional wreck, **and a pile on the floor** even if you do not end up on the floor.

So thanks for the hug, but I am not letting you go until I feel better =P Takes the hug and just rests, it was not that horrible of day for 80% of it, but during the last 20% I became exhausted, and sensory overloading and this is a big deal due to my sensory issues ( a common comorbidity with ADHD.)

So thanks for the hug, but I am not letting you go until I feel better =P Some doctors are also prescribing mixtures of these drugs. So a low dose of a non stimulant along with a low dose of a stimulant. Might be worth asking about so you can limit side effects Oh I see, thanks for the correction!
