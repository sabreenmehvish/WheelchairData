temporarily off meds - realizing now how much they've helped Well, HOPEFULLY it's just temporary!  I’m writing this because I’m sad about my current situation, but don’t have many people in my life I can commiserate with regarding ADHD.

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with ADHD (primarily inattentive) about three months ago. I’m 32, so this was one of those later-in-life diagnoses. I was a good student grades-wise (although I always figured out how to cut corners and BS my way to good grades plus have major issues with procrastination) and grew up with siblings who had a ton of behavioral issues, so I slipped through the cracks. I recently learned that nearly everyone in my immediate family has ADHD.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, I moved to a new state. The doctors I’ve seen won’t honor my ADHD diagnosis since they don’t trust other doctors, and are essentially having me go through a series of appointments over the next 1-2 months to reach their own diagnosis. I’ve been trying to ration my meds, but I now only have three pills remaining. I’m trying to save them for super taxing days. I’m a student in an intensive program, and am very nervous about doing well without my meds for so long. I dropped out of the last program I was in for a variety of reasons, one of which was because I couldn’t handle the large amount of reading required. I’ve dabbled in several different careers at this point; similarly, my current program is in a completely different subject area from the one before.

Once I began ADHD medication, I felt a noticeable improvement in my quality of life. I could accomplish more, I felt happier, I could focus in lectures, I wasn’t pulling all-nighters, etc. I suffer from chronic migraines and a sleep disorder (DSPS), and I noticed improvements in both.

&#x200B;

I have mostly been off of my ADHD medication for the past two weeks now, and I can see how much it helped me. Issues I’ve had the past two weeks, which I now realize I’ve been dealing with always:

&#x200B;

\- I have trouble verbally communicating with people. My mind works very quickly sometimes, which can result in the following: (1) I’ll have three thoughts hit at once and stutter or pause until I figure out which one to reply with (2) I mix up words, either combining them like a portmanteau or using an incorrect but maybe contextually adjacent one (ex: I said “swimming with the fishes” when I meant “sleeping with the fishes”) (3) I think I’m being clear, but realize later I was talking either in hard-to-follow circles or too quickly and am met with blank/confused stares by others.

&#x200B;

\- I have trouble regulating my emotions. Either I get frustrated or let someone’s frustrations upset me. Afterwards, I have trouble concentrating on other, more important things because I’m still mad or upset.

&#x200B;

\- I skip steps and don’t listen, even when I think I am following along fine. As a result, I have to redo projects from scratch, endure an unpleasant conversation where someone is like, “Um… I never said that…”, or ask a question that’s already been answered (or worry if I should ask a question, because I have no idea if it’s already been asked).

&#x200B;

\- I tend to do a lot of things at once, but none of it particularly well. Multiple people this week commented on the amount of tabs I have open in my browser (\~60). During lecture, I google things (both related and unrelated) constantly. But if an article is long (like this post), I can only get myself to skim it (but then I tell myself I'll go back to it later). I love watching TV, but I usually have to rewind every few minutes because I'll get the urge to do something on my phone or computer. I usually then stop paying attention at the same moment as before and realize it a few minutes later when I find myself confused at the same place. Rewind again. Stop paying attention. Confused. Repeat for a while.

&#x200B;

\- I have a lot of trouble reading for long periods of time and retaining what I’ve read. In class, we read one chapter per week from the same book. While on meds, I did okay reading and annotating. I still read slowly and needed to break up the chapter, but I could stay on task. Off meds, I reread the same sentences over and over again. I also have a bunch of thoughts fly through my brain (mostly unrelated). While reading the chapter, I wrote a 20-point to-do and to-look-up list of the thoughts that zipped into my mind. If I hadn’t done this, I would have put the book down and started to look up websites completely unrelated to the content.

&#x200B;

\- I spend money when I shouldn’t. Last week, I thought I absolutely needed several hundred dollars’ worth of random items. Over the next week, as I received boxes with the items I had purchased, I only vaguely remembered buying them and realized I didn’t really need most of the items.

&#x200B;

\- When I'm bored and can't use my phone or computer, I daydream or just space out. I can physically stay in my seat or in line, but mentally I've left the building.

&#x200B;

\- It doesn't take much to make me feel overwhelmed. When this happens, I might freeze/ignore, excuse myself so I may cry in a bathroom, weasel my way out, or look for shortcuts. Next, I might proceed to healthier coping mechanisms like creating a to-do list, putting due dates on my calendar, and breaking tasks down into smaller pieces. This issue is really affecting me right now, since school is a lot and also the doctors I've been seeing are making things so complicated (ex: I have to miss so much class to go to these appointments).

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Off meds hopefully for a month or so. IT SUCKS. You could ask a GP for Wellbutrin, used for depression and quitting smoking. . It’s not really abusable, and doesn’t need to be weaned off of, like SSRIs. It gives you a little dopamine and norepinephrine kick. The only thing is that when I took it, it gave me insomnia and heart palpitations, but everyone reacts differently to meds and I was dealing with some serious post partum depression. It’s not as effective as a stimulant, but it might tide you over.  I started on Concerta a few weeks ago and I'm constant worried about this- what will happen if I move away for school and will have to find another doctor? thanks! will look into this. i've seen people on here suggest neuropsych testing. and i think that might be worth it, so that we can show quantifiable results to any new doctors. i could be wrong, but ugh.
