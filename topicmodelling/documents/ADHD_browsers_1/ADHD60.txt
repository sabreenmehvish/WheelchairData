LPT: Use these extensions to limit the number of tabs you can open in your browser. Getting information off the Internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant. ~ Mitchell Kapor

I am an information addict. I snort webpages through my eyes and like your nose bleeds on excess cocaine, my eyes are swollen because I have so much to read all day. Fuck! Last night I had 34 tabs open and I wanted to read them all, everything was important. My head was bursting and my eyes wanted to drop out and run and never come back, ever!

I am a chronic tab hoarder. I will come on reddit and open every link on the front page and then go to each link and open more links and when I look at the time I realize I have spent more than 2 hours where I was just suppose to check it out for 5 mins. And this happens every fucking day. Now with ADHD you have to set some external limitation and some one to remind you that you are fucking up because I only realize that there is a storm when I am in it, right in the center of it. 

So I am on my bed and I am thinking to myself -- if I can limit the number of tabs I can open. Say 4 tabs only and then I'll be forced to go through them and close them and that would also be great for my attention and what have you. I know that it will save my life.

So after searching the corners of the internet and trying a bunch of extensions, these are the best ones :  

-------------------------------------------------- 

**Chrome** : [Controlled multi-tab browsing] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/controlled-multi-tab-brow/kokmfemecmlekdnjllgobeplngdfifie)

**Description**

Set maximum tabs that can be opened and restrict yourself from opening tabs more than the set limit.

The habit of opening too many tabs may hamper your system performance. Also, you might waste your time just traversing in between the opened tabs or managing those using some fancy extension and often learning nothing. So, I suggest you to keep some well-judged limit on the number of tabs and to adhere use  "Read and Discard" strategy. 

Try this extension, set your tab limit and you will really find yourself learning more by actually using/reading the webpages rather than just managing and traversing the opened tabs.

------------------------------------------

I have set my limit to 4 and the moment I want to open the 5th tab it shows a pop up which says "You have decided to not open more than 4 tabs" and I press OK. That's  all. It won't let me open more than 4 tabs at all. It's extreme, there are other extension which are flexible and will only remind you that you are going over your limit and then let you open the tab but that's not what I need because I know I am not one of those that will take that seriously. I will go over my limit like I have all these years.  I can change my limit but then If I do that then no external force can save my soul so I'll stick to the limit I have set for myself.  

I don't use Firefox but if I did, I'd surely use this add-on.

------------------------------------------

**Firefox** : [Window and Tab Limiter] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/window-and-tab-limiter/)

**About this Add-on**

After rewriting a business system from scratch as a web application, and switching all users over to FireFox, the one problem I wound up with is that a lot of users would never, ever close any windows. By the end of the day, some users would have 20 or 30 browser windows open and wonder why their computer was running slow. They also got very confused trying to navigate through all those windows. So I wrote this extension that lets you specify the maximum number of windows (or tabs) that can be open at any time (The default value is 10).

This is a rewrite of the extension to add lots of new features. There is no a preference dialog that let's you do lots of new cool things

a) There is now password protection. By setting a password, users will be unable to alter the number of windows and tabs they are limited to opening

b) There are now 3 modes of operation for the extension

"Suggest" - If the user exceeds the maximum amount of opened windows and tabs, they will be presented with a list of window and tabs and they can either choose to close one or more of them, or they can ignore the warning and continue working

"Force" - The same as above, but the user is required to close at least one window

"Silent" - This is like the old version. It automatically closes windows and/or tabs as the maximum allowed limit is reached.

-----------------------

There is x-Tabs for chrome which has similar options but the reviews are not good and I don't want any extension to automatically close something I have open. 

The extension is awesome and I can already see how my surfing experience is going to change for good. Hope this helps you.   Hey, thanks! Passing this along to everyone I know. 

Edit: In the past three hours, it has already yelled at me 5 times, making me realize I'm pseudo-working instead of working on stuff. Seriously, thanks. This is great. I wonder if they make anything like this for android. Wow! This is amazing! Thank you so much. I've always had a problem with tabs. Now that I've gotten a computer which is far more powerful than my previous one, I now get to have even more tabs open. So I'll have 10 windows open with something like 35 tabs open in each one. I kid you not. And then I try to go about closing the ones I don't need, but then get side-tracked and open even more tabs. It never ends! So again, thank you! 

(tabs open right now: 99. And I did a tab cleanup earlier today.) I have 118 tabs I think they do. When I was going through these extensions I saw this question in some tech forum. There might be something out there.
