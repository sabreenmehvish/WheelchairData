Anyone finding the Streaks app helpful? Just heard about it but would like to know anyone’s experience with the app and ADHD! Is it worth the $5? 

If so, what’s your drive to keep logging tasks or whatever? Notifications are super easy for me to ignore, but something with a good interface might keep me interested. 

For anyone who hasn’t looked at the app, it’s a habit forming/breaking type app where you log different tasks and it tracks streaks. Looks pretty cool 

TLDR: Wondering if task and habit tracking app (Streaks) helpful with ADHD, motivation, and getting stuff done 

Edit: added tldr  on a side note is there an app that's similar that's free?  I havent used that particular one but I used Habitrpg for a while which was free. It's like a game so it kept my attention longer than most apps like that do.
edit: apparently its now called Habitica Yeah I love that app. Helped me get into a bunch of habits a while back. Only thing is that it made me feel way to pressured to be perfect.. like I couldn't fail. I have some mad perfectionism and Family of origin induced anxiety about it, so it stressed me out a bit too much. I didn’t consider that but definitely can see that effect for people with ADHD. 

Did you keep the habits the app helped you form?  HAHAHA I don't remember which habits I was working on exactly!! I remember it was super motivational tho.

Maybe working out 5 days a week, working on art 5 days a week... Tracking my no-migraine days.

Those are all long term habits that I'm still working on years later :) Not sure if they'll ever be completely internalized :<
