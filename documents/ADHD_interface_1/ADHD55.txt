Adult ADHD retreats I’ve been procrastinating from editing and layout for a publication that needs to be sent to the printers in two weeks by googling for ADHD retreats. Go figure.

Anyway, I’m only coming across two: this retreat for women 40 and up in North Carolina and one by a Dr. Norwall. I don’t fall in the age range for the first, and the second doesn’t have one for the month I’m able to travel.

Would love some leads on others! 

I was diagnosed two years ago at 30 years old and live and work in a place where only online therapy and self help are feasible. Really craving a group setting.
