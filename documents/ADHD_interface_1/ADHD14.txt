I just realized why I prefer command line over graphical interfaces for computers People have told me I'm weird when I insist that I prefer command line tools (like those that run on a terminal like for Linux) over tools with graphics.

It's because I lose track of what I'm doing so often that having a terminal which logs everything I've done ( and the results from doing it) lets me catch up. Also, I think the "man" command is great because no matter what I'm doing, it gives me instructions in the same familiar manner each time I run it.

TL;DR: Command lines provide step-by-step logs you can check when working and lets me recover from distractions.

Anyone else have examples of things that are viewed as "less optimal" in general, but may be better for people with ADHD?
