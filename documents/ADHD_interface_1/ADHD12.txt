DIY planner pages for August! Hey friends!

Some of you might remember my [DIY planner post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4t0l7q/my_diy_planner_is_helping_my_adhd_more_than_i/) from a few weeks ago.  It was great to talk with so many people about what works & what doesn't in terms of planners and organizing!  And I really appreciated all of the comments and encouragement.  This'll be a short post as I'm on a road trip at the moment (tethering ftw!), but I wanted to post an updated set of pages for August, and let you all know what I'm thinking about for making these available more easily.

First off, here are the PDFs for August!  There's both a blank and a form fillable version below.  Please let me know if you find any errors etc. & I'll try to respond as quickly as I can (but since I'm traveling it might not be immediate).  You can find instructions for printing on the previous post I linked above...it's still more or less accurate, but there's an extra set of weekly pages since August has 5 weeks.

Second, I'm working on some options for printing these on demand (subscription based, etc) as there were a number of requests for that sort of thing.  Right now I'm thinking of continuing to post basic pages like you see here for free, with some bonus perks (e.g. printing, maybe some additional customization) for some sort of fee.  That way people who want to try it out, or who are happy w/ using the free version, can continue to do so, & those who would prefer a little more customization (or who don't want to print their own) can get that as well.  I'm still working out the details so stay tuned! you should do a mailing list sign up or something similar to we can be kept in the loop for when you start up. I will definitely be purchasing. Am i the only one having problems? Can you send the InDD form because when I go to type in text up top for monthly log the font is too large and I cannot edit it to be smaller. and theres no way i can hand write that small either.  Are you still working on selling these? I'm very interested in purchasing These are fantastic. I can't thank you enough!!! Excellent! This is a really great planner. 

Could I impose a humble request to make a version with a layout that works for 8.5/11? I don't mind the 2 pages per sheet, but I prefer full size and the current layout misaligns the weeks with the calendars when printed that way.

Excellent work!  bless you. those pages have saved my life these past few weeks. :) I just saw your DIY planner post and I'm in love. I have the pens already, and I'm so excited to draw my own cover every month. 

Thank you so much. I'm going to print them out to start, but I'll probably bind like you did once I get used to the planner and find what works for me.  Just found your post, the planner looks amazing. Now I am a bit sad that August is almost over. Any chance that there will be an option for  September or maybe (someday) even a whole year?
It looks really helpful, thank you for sharing :) You are an awesome human being! This appeals to my need to organize my madness and to customize it all in an artistically pleasing way. Thank you so much for making it available for the rest of us scatterbrained folk. :D  The fillable form and InDesign files (for July) are especially appreciated because my printer's ink would be dead every month.  If you have the time, this would make for a profitable side business. You're a saint!

Is there any way to make the Month/Dates a fillable form?  This is great! I found this as a cheaper (and more tedious) option to the hole puncher you recommended in the other post.

Have you seen it mentioned anywhere?

Oh the plus side I'd get a wrist workout. These are wonderful! Any chance of you making one without the months on it so that we can reprint the same file each month?  Also thank you. You are a wonderful human being. I look forward to making my own but would also buy in a heartbeat. It'd be great if u/wizardwithay sells these!  Hi there!  Sorry it's not working for you. Like I said in my post, I'm on vacation so I have limited access to my files & to wifi connections.  I tested the form again and the fonts should be embedded & the correct size (at least that's how it appears on my end). They do have to be large enough to print legibly, so when I use the form I have to do a little abbreviating. If you have Acrobat Pro you're free to adjust any of the form elements as needed. Good luck! Hi there!  Thanks for the kind words.  To be really honest, making this in another size is something I probably can't do right at the moment (although I'd like to be able to when I have the time).  Right now, I'm just sharing the files I'm already making for myself. This coming fall will be insanely busy for me (working on a PhD & trying to finish in time) so I need to be careful about not taking too much on. However, if I'm eventually able to expand this into something I could offer for print, I'd definitely want to offer it at a larger size as well. Absolutely! I've never used indesign, so can't really do much of anything there myself.

If you eventually get it offered up for print, that would be amazing!

good work.
