What organisational system do the university students here use? I'm struggling with organisation. The layout of the website that my school uses is all sorts of confusing, so I'm hoping to find a way to lay out my tasks and files that's actually functional. There's so many different kinds of things though, links, required reading and PDFs, relating to tutorials, lectures and assessments separately. I can never seem to get into my head exactly what needs doing, in what order. 

My current system involves subject folders with weekly sub-folders for all the files, MS Office for my class calendar (and life things) and an app called myHomework for links, readings and due dates. Whenever something new comes in, it's a major stress inputting the information, but it seems to be the best I can do for now.

So my actual question! What system to you use to keep track of all this stuff?
