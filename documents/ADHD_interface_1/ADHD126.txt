Had a good week, what are some of your recent successes overcoming ADHD? Only found this subred a few days ago and I'd like to say thanks. I tried adhdforums.com for support but I find this layout much less intimidating and the community much more supportive. I've been keeping up with my medication and actually studying for tests in school. I joined a study group, regardless of my fear of new people which means I'm spending more time with them instead of this one girl who I only hang out with because she is familiar. She is actually quite rude and very judgemental about my ADHD even though she has a LD herself :S Things like scoffing at me when I ask questions in class and seeming smug when I dont do well on tests. While I'm not exactly ready to stand up to her, I am coming out of my shell and talking to people. I even remember some people's names, which is so hard for me.
Anyhow, I noticed an absence of good day stories, so here is mine.

TL;DR I had a good week regardless of ADHD, taking my pills, doing hw, making friends. 
What are some successes (big or small) you've had lately coping with ADHD? I recently started taking my meds. I have been doing my UNGRADED homework and prereading! I'm listening in lectures and biting my tongue before saying stupid shit and interrupting people.  Hey merlisha, congratulations on your successes! I hope you'll share them again in tomorrow's Win Wednesday thread. Here's a whole bunch of success stories for you from last week's thread--we do these every week. :)
