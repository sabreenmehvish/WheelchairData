I want to help other people (specifically girls) with ADHD, so I'm thinking of starting a blog...Is this a good idea? Is there a demand for it? Should I waste my time hyperfocusing on something else? Honestly, I've always wanted to be one of those 20-something bloggers that works from home, has a floral theme with a fancy font on their website, and always has comments about how helpful her posts are. Unfortunately, I don't really have any super helpful knowledge or life hacks or an interesting life at all. 

I do have ADHD though, and I would love to help others by sharing tips, ideas, etc! Every ADHD blog I've ever read is so boring (layout as well as content) and idk, mostly I just love helping people.

I figured here would be the perfect place to ask....
**do you think that this kind of blog would be useful?** 
**what kind of content would you want to see?**

**TL;DR: Thinking about starting an ADHD blog focused mainly on women with ADHD...can't decide if it's a good idea or not? What kind of content would you like to see?** Go for it! We women with ADHD are much different than men. Plus I get so tired of reading about kids and school and parent issues. üòÅ  Link me if you do start one! I love all the bujo spread blogs but I feel like they're too inflexible for the hectic adhd life. Women are so used to multitasking and chaos they apparently get diagnosed much later. I got diagnosed recently at 26 after about a year of suspecting, and there don't seem to be many resources specifically targeted at women.  Pretty please do. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until this past summer (am now almost 21y) and every now and then I honest to god wonder if I really have ADHD. I mean I get along without medication. I do pretty well in school and stuff. I‚Äôve lived a decent chunk of my life not knowing I had the condition and doing okay. Then I start wondering if I‚Äôm just playing myself and doing this to make an excuse or get attention. Really just start beating myself up for not being more ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù with like time management and remembering. Wondering if it‚Äôs just my fault. It‚Äôs other people‚Äôs stories, especially girls my age that not only make me feel more assured that no I am struggling with something even if I can manage, but also help me learn about what exactly I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôm new to all this. My family and many of my friends are either just as lost as I am or just don‚Äôt want to talk about it at all. I know I love blogs and that YouTube channel how to adhd and those things helped me a lot when I started wondering about getting diagnosed. 

Long spiel short I would love to hear your stories cuz they honestly help me a lot and I bet I‚Äôm not the only one.  DO IT! So many ADHD blogs are focused on boys, it's about time we get some flowers up in here. :)  It's been done through youtube:

I saw her Tedx Talk yesterday, and everything in my life clicked.  Yes. Good idea!  You should definitely go for it! It will get you into the blogging world, it will help you understand ADHD better yourself and it may even help someone or save a life!  I would love to see a blog like this. Looks like you tried to share it but they removed the post. would love a link to it! Yes! That‚Äôs exactly how I feel too!
