Trying to ADHD proof my home...ideas most welcome! As per usual for us folks, it's 22:23 here in the UK and I've just decided I want to ADHD proof our home (me and 4 Year old son) as I'm so sick of forgetting things, not doing chores in a timely fashion, panicking because bags aren't packed etc.
Now, I have one thing that I used in the past and need to reinstate and that's a simple tick box chart from Monday to Sunday on the cupboard over the kettle for medication, totally invaluable and I don't know when's stopped doing it! Any longer than a week at a time and I stop ticking, so seven days works for me.

Another thing is maybe reusing my bullet journal, pretty sure the reason I failed there was my hyperfocussed obsessing over layouts and the best possible structure, km the end I left it on a shelf in despair!

I also want to put a keys, purse and glasses etc shelf above the coat rack because damn is that needed!!

Any other tips and tricks would be fabulously helpful, and sorry for rambling (which is something I'm sure we all say every darn day).

Escapee x Don't over organize. If you know all mail goes in one place and you need a bill, you know where to go. It might take ten minutes but it's there. When one piece of mail doesn't exactly fit the elaborate filing system you made, YOU WILL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN  Know yourself. I used to get voracious rages of organization motivation and decide to create an entirely new system and places for everything in my apartment ("Why would I hang my jackets over here? They should be over THERE by the door! That way, I'll stop just slinging them on my kitchen table.")

When these bouts of inspiration inevitably failed miserably, I tried a different approach.

I am NEVER going to hang my jackets. Ever.

Instead of trying to develop a magical organized world where all my jackets are hung (which in a fit of hyperfocus I would, maybe every other month, hang EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE!) I bought a coat rack instead. Now, I have a place to sling my bags and jackets all in one corner of the room, and I never have to interact with a coat hanger or closet!

Similarly, I have a walk-in closet where I used to always fling clothes I didn't want to put away on top of a tall plastic storage bin against the wall. I desperately wanted to fill that space with some drawers or shelves, but I was extremely particular about what I wanted to get.

I was ALWAYS going to toss my clothes somewhere. If I tried to fill that space with something that didn't include a wide surface for crumpling unwanted clothes, then those clothes were just going to end up in another corner, or another surface, or possible just on the floor beneath my feet. What definitely wouldn't happen, was some sudden motivation to put my clothes back where they belong.

I finally found the perfect set of shelves + drawers and adjusted the shelves so that I had a large space to plopping my clothes--I call it my "staging area" and I just go with it. 

It still gets out of hand all the time, but those clothes HAVE their dedicated space--which means when I want to fling them elsewhere...I don't. I put them there. That's where the lazy clothes go.

So, think about your behaviors and the tendencies you have. Don't force yourself into routines that are foreign to you or unpleasant for you. And definitely DON'T trick yourself into the false believe that punishing yourself is effective ("If I just make it impossible/unpleasant to do this disorganized thing, then I definitely won't do it ever again!") You will find a way around your obstacles and then end up stressing yourself out tenfold.

Look at your daily routines, spot the parts that you wish were more organized or you were more on top of, and then put things at eye level, within arms reach, in those places where you naturally go--not necessarily where you think they *should* go, because it's expected or usual. Having a key holder right by the door has helped me not lose my keys as much. The fact that it's right by the door makes it so there's absolutely no excuse for me NOT to use it. 

I also hang my dogs leash there.  You know those clothes that you wore once and don't want to put away, but aren't dirty enough for the laundry basket? 

They get their own laundry basket instead of living on a random chair or the floor. Everything you mentioned is really great and helps me a ton! 

I created a little "essentials kit" for myself to keep in every bag/backpack/etc that I might use daily or weeklyâ€”tissues, lip balm, hand lotion, eye drops, extra contact lens container, over the counter meds (painkillers, allergy meds), cheap earbuds (I like to listen to music and use this for phone calls in public), small notebook/pen, extra phone charger, and small snack (nuts or granola bars, something that won't go bad and is fine to eat if it gets a bit beat up). I stick these all in small plastic bags or empty pencil/cosmetic pouches and stage a kit everywhere, so I'm always prepared if I happen to be out longer than I expected. I'm kind of doing the same now! I live in a small apartment so Muji is my inspiration :)

I'm remove all obsticles for getting things and putting them away.

In general I'm trying to systemize, grouping items in containers, and keep colors to minimum. 

I'm getting sorting-binsnow. You can hang them on panels/rails or stacking them. 
[white ones from containerstore](https://www.containerstore.com/s/storage/plastic-bins-baskets/white-medium-akrobins/12d?productId=11003417) I'm getting them all in light-grey from an ordinary hardware store. 

I use a magnetic cloud for my keys.

Maybe should get one of those trackers.. 

Magnets for bobpins and other small metal stuff is awesome.

Trash and recycling "closeby" - if it's easy to throw away it will be thrown away.

I have a huge (huge) whiteboard...

I like to remove labels of things like shampoo/showercream-bottles, or put in refillable containers. Less distracting for me to use a letra-tag instead.

I will keep an eye on this thread :) Plastic stick-on hooks are really good for keys and sorts too! I do find that cleaning/tidiying up really good (in my case with the Mari Kondo way, you can also use fly lady)
Really helped me, and it's easier for me to keep it up.
And keep track of stuff. **Declutter BEFORE you organise**. And especially before you go out buying storage bins for like 80 random baking supplies that turn out to be expired. Uh. Happened to a friend of mine...

**Get a bin in every room**, helps avoid random little pileups.

**If you must make a system, LABEL EVERYTHING**. literally every drawer and shelf in my study is labeled, and I have a 1 page diagram of all the labels. It's the first time I've been able to keep things organised for more than a hyperfocused day.

**Pick up wandering items EVERY DAY**. Idk about you, but 80% of our mess is just stuff that belongs in another room.

Random neatness rule: **things only get to live on the counters / surfaces if you use it more than once a day**. Any less than that, and it needs a home in a drawer etc. You'd be amazed how much random stuff you'll put away that was cluttering up your aesthetic & functional space for no reason. The clearer the surface, the easier it is to notice when something's out of place. 

**Check if the problem is process or execution.** even the world's sexiest whiteboard system won't work if you constantly ignore it. Accountability is the cure-all for following any system - bet a friend a small yet significant sum of money, that you'll send them a pic of your clean house by a certain time every week. That'll breathe new life into your whiteboard!  > my hyperfocussed obsessing over layouts and the best possible structure

Yup, perfectionism. I have to remind myself I'm not picking something for the rest of my entire life, I can more to another journal later. I find this process needs to be done slowly. When all the bills are scattered around the house, a box is a great organization system. It took me years to finally want to do something about the box besides starting a new one each year.

So, last November I decided to sort the box and keep it sorted. Some weeks are better than others and one day I might not need the box.  Right now? I wouldn't live without it.

Organization, like anything good in life, is a long-term effort. I now have some fairly ingrained habits that have allowed me to organize and deal with problems I once thought were hopeless. 

I'm still terrible at it; just better than before. This is really good advice, thank you! Woah. I mostly do some of this as I live on a sailboat, I just make sure I can see everything. The boat helps because it's sort of designed with specialty places for things and stuff. I still lose shit though, not sure how seeing as I live on a 34' oval.  I have one too.
Dog leash and ALL our keys are on it.
It's a lifesaver
