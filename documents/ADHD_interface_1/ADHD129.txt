Organisation tip: Hipster PDA  Something I have found to be helpful in management of both long term projects and day-to-day goals is having a to do list - in the form of the 'hipster PDA'. All you need is paper or index cards and a bulldog clip, and the will to set a routine of checking it and transferring items to be done onto it.

Stuff to be done gets added either to that day's to-do card, or if it can't be actioned that day it goes onto a weekly/monthly card, and gets transferred to the to-do list for the day it's due to be done.

Tips like using a visually informative layout rather than a list help, too: dividing the index card for the day into chunks of different sizes, and fill the biggest chunks with the most important/urgent items makes it more easily read at a glance, since you just search for the biggest thing on the page to know where to start.

For templates to make your own I recommend the guides at [D*I*Y Planner](www.diyplanner.com/templates/official/hpda) or at [43 folders](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda). Go check 'em out! Removed from spam filter. Oh man, I can just see myself using one of these things and then having the clip break somehow, the cards fly everywhere, and then I put them back in the wrong order or something... :(

It's a cool idea, and if it works for you that's awesome. But I like my smartphone because it's backup-able. thx :)
