Stressing out about job hunting and ADHD and needing to work from home. I'm good at what I do. I have a successful etsy, am fantastic at social media, great at small business skills.

**I understand my adhd,** and after nearly a quarter of a century of trying, I understand how to function like a human and get things done. Which is to say, on my own terms.

But I need another job. My Etsy is doing well, but it's not lucrative enough for NYC. 

**I need a more stable job,** I know that. And I'm trying. But I've only ever felt truly capable of succeeding when I'm in charge of myself. I need flexibility to function.


Was the person who invented open office layouts specifically plotting against people with ADHD? I have so much anxiety thinking about what it'd be like to be in that environment.


I go into hyperfocus and I'm like a superhero, but if I get distracted for a second, I spend the next 45 minutes forgetting what I was doing and thinking about what else needs to get done. 

**Offices have a) open distractions and b) people seeing me be distracted and thinking I'm a bad worker.**

Best part? **The fact that I suck in office environments would only "prove" to a boss that I'd just get distracted at home.**

**But I don't get distracted here.** I have my wall of neon post its by my desk that I'm constantly rearranging and writing and throwing away when I'm done. (desks with no wall space = my personal hell) 

I love taking cleaning breaks to keep me functional during work hours. I can't spend 40 minutes doing the dishes in the office if my mind is too cluttered.

**I need to work on what I want when I want.** Not that I don't do things, but if I'm interested in something and know I can be good at it, that's what I'm doing and I'm awesome. And then I'll do the thing I've been putting off. But I'm scared at a job I'll get told off.

**I also hate commuting for more than 10 minutes,** because by the time I'm ready to leave the apt, my meds have kicked in and I feel like **I'm wasting my limited functioning time, and it gives me crippling anxiety.**

**TL;DR: I need to figure how to work from home for a stable job and communicate to possible employers that I'm fantastic at working from home even though I'm useless in person.**

I also need to start my resume, but that's a whole other mess.
