Dexedrine SR 10mg for 1 week. 28[M], last year of uni, Bachelor of Nursing. Helping with coursework, but disastrous in clinical setting? Hi there, been lurking for just under a month! I was diagnosed ADHD quiet early on. I'm fuzzy about my past and am generally trying to reconstruct it. What I do know is I stopped medication at 16, and my last prescription was 15mg Dexedrine SR. My mother says medication was hugely effective for my medication, and we cycled through "several" different meds before Dexedrine.

This semester I had not submitted anything on time. Upon this a instructor whom I respect approached me with concerns about my quality of work and my level of engagement. I did some ADHD research and realized that many of my behaviours and struggles are in line with described symptoms of adult ADHD. As such I approached the university's medical staff and explained my situation to a MD. The MD screened me with 3 questionnaires, 1 ADHD, 1 Depression, 1 Anxiety, all were positive screen. ADHD being the highest score of the screens, and the reason why I sought help we agreed that we'd start treatment there and monitor the other two. Anyways I'm 8 days in from the start of Dexedrine 10mg SR.

Benefits: 

* Starting tasks is much easier
* Remaining on task is possible without that hyper focusing
* Able to get back on task when distracted
* Subjectively I feel more capable of engaging in life and getting things done, happier
* Less fatigued, naps in the mid-day are more of a "I could" instead of a "So tired must lay down"

Challenges:

* Headaches during end of action period, will remain until sleep, coronal suture site(Top front of the head), 1/10 severity, dull constantly pain
* Flight of thoughts and actions. That is to say individual actions/thoughts are engaged and completed, but that logical or sequential building of actions/thoughts to make them efficient/organized is absent.
* I feel "flighty", or "racey" about 2 hours after ingestion, I do not feel euphoric, or high. Unsure as to when this ends, it is not present at the end of the therapeutic period.
* Errors while writing/typing. I occasionally make errors when spelling, usually around prefix/suffix/homogenous sounding words (Eg: will write sending when I meant to write send, or write quiet/quite interchangeably). However, while on Dexedrine I've been making what seems to be pyschomotor errors, where I just have random extra keystrokes, or disjointed typing patterns.

**The issue:** 
I am a 4th year nursing student who just started the 4th year clinical rotations. I had 2 very bad clinical days on Dexedrine. I've been placed on a learning contract (Basically a sign you may fail). My instructor described my thought process and actions as I did above in the challenges section. I was clinically unsafe on those first two days, missing assessments and jumping to solutions, and just generally unorganized (thankfully I was being monitored, nothing adverse happened). The third day of clinical I did not take Dexedrine in the morning, and had a markedly improved day, to the point where my instructor said "If you had acted like this early in the week I wouldn't have considered a contract, and if you continue on we can get you off the contract by the end of next week". 

**Overall:**
My coursework at home is much easier to start and I've even been able to organize and layout my assignments and when I need to complete them. I've been making more errors while working, but I'm working longer and in a more consistent fashion. I've been able to start exercising somewhat regularly again, and I'm completing daily activities of living before they need to be completed. I'm less fatigued in the mid-day, and I am not having difficulty sleeping; I am drinking less coffee in the morning. I feel better able to act like a "normal person". 

**My questions:**

* Is this all in my head? I've been very successful, and safe in past clinical settings, those first two days were EXTREMELY out of character. 

* Should I ask to go down to 5mg SR, or 2.5 mg x3 daily? 

* Should I allow myself more time to become use to the effects of Dexedrine, develop new coping strategies, work ethics, and organization skills?

* Should I only take Dexedrine on the days when I'm not in clinical? My MD made it clear, "daily, monitor the effects." (This is the solution I'm thinking will be most successful until my next appointment.)

TL:DR New to all medications, Dexedrine SR 10m/day for the last week, day to day life has been very much improved, clinical setting (Acute nursing care in hospital) has been dangerous. Questions: Real?, Change med dose?, Do nothing? Change administration pattern? Other advise/thoughts are welcome.

Thanks!
 Hi Hyper!  I too am a Bachelor of Nursing student with ADHD-PI (although much more recently diagnosed).  My doctor is using Concerta for me but I've also noticed an issue with how it performs in school/study situations vs. "real life".

My take on it is that in a clinical environment our ADHD brains are adequately stimulated and so having the stimulant onboard is overkill.  Thus the strange behaviours/thought patterns.  I find that I don't need my stims on clinical days for that reason.  With everything going on over the course of a clinical day, my multitasking brain has enough to focus on that it can't go flitting about all over the place.  When I sit at home and try to get some work done on that group project, forget it!  Hey, how about I watch a little TV as a reward for that sentence I just wrote?  Or, ooh - interesting concept, I should google that and research it a little more.  2 hours later, hmmm I guess I should go back to that project.

All that to say, speak with your doctor, explain the situation and understand that there is no reason that I have found so far (based on literature reviews) why you should have to take a stimulant 7 days a week.  In fact, most physicians recommend days without it just to minimize tolerance.  Maybe even call his office before the appointment and just see if the staff will clarify with him that he doesn't have an issue with you choosing to skip some days.  

Best of luck in your last year!  I've got 1.5 left :( We can't really suggest anything because we don't know you, your physiology, your medical history, etc. You should talk about it with the doctor prescribing your meds. Try lowering your dose. I realized with dexedrine increasing your dose increases the physical effects but don't do much to the psychological. I've been on 10mg XR for about 2 years now with no real issues. Try taking weekends off the medication even if it means sleeping like crazy. Cardio exercise (when off meds) helps too. Hi Galipemi!

Very cool to meet another nursing student! 

I came to the same conclusion about the clinical setting. I've worked in a trauma 1 ED for several years now, I've realized its is the perfect environment for a person with ADHD. The clinical environment is similarly stimulating, with very real and immediate motivating factors (Eg: instructor breathing down your neck)! I'm going in tomorrow morning and I hope to have a better day off the meds. 

I hope the last 1.5 year goes by fast for you! I'm exhausted by school in general, and I'm looking forward to getting back to a "normal" life routine! There is life after nursing school (I'm almost sure of it)!

Thanks for sharing your experience! Definitely, I've another appointment arranged. I'll discuss all this when that rolls around, in the mean time I'm left to developing my own course of actions.

I was hoping for opinion pieces either on the situation or the questions posed in general. Hey - how was your clinical without the Dexedrine?  I hope it went better!

Interesting work experience - I'm a clerk in a community ED, level 1 trauma must be a crazy experience.  We mostly get the "why did you come to a freaking emerge for this?" kind of patients but occasionally get something interesting. MY following clinical days have all been very successful. I had my midterm last Friday. During my midterm my clinical instructors was very happy with my care, thought processes, and knowledge level! Upon this she was very complementary with several of my skills. 

My instructor implemented the learning contract on the first two days, with the Dexedrine in system. The third day without Dex she was completing the paper work/ system work for the contract, which would kick into effect the following week; she admitted to me during the midterm review that she hesitated because the third day was such a bizarre and rapid improvement. She reported that I had been preforming well within expected levels for all shifts except those first two shifts. As such she ended the learning contract, 3 days after she had implemented it.

So things are going great, I'm feeling confident again, and I'm preforming well in clinical and class! Upon this I've changed to taking Dexedrine on off clinical days, which has allowed me to continue having successful and productive days.


My Emerg has two areas after the renovations 3 years ago. We absorbed the old ICU and converted it into a minor emerg treatment area. So yes we get the "You know there are community resources, specifically for this, right?" type of clients still, but we mainly throw them in ED2 (New area) while ED1 (Old area) still functions as our "Yeah, we need to do something quickly here". The down side to this is that ED2 sort of acts as a walk in clinic staffed with ER nurses, which doesn't always go over with the staff working in that area; that being said every once in awhile they catch something that was pretty asymptomatic, or masked by another condition that does require admission or ER treatment. Examples being like (Making something up) 'Gas pain' and 'vomiting' after eating spoiled food, actually being an ectopic pregnancy.
 I'm glad you're getting into the swing of managing the ADHD, the meds and the work.  It's not always an easy balance!

Our dept also has a rapid assessment type spot and while most things are simple and straight forward, some times we get that acute Appy or other admission worthy diagnosis.  If nothing else, it is helping me with school and experience.  Some of our nurses are great and willing to talk me through a differential diagnosis or lab results since they know I'm a nursing student.  Even though I'm a clerk and do clerical work for the most part, they have been willing to let me listen in and on occasion help out (non-clinically) when something interesting is happening.  I love my team!
