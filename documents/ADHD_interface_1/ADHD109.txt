Some Tips for Eating on Vyvance (and other such drugs) I started Vyvance recently, and so I scoured the land for tips on managing my new non-existent appetite. I'd like to share with you the things I've found, in the hopes that you'll get some help out of it too. Even on other meds, these tips will help you eat better and in turn will actually help manage some of your attention troubles, I've found.

I'd like this to be sort of a comprehensive list, so that people don't have to do what I did. I've love more suggestions.

I've tried to make a simple, easy-to-read layout. I know it's long!

Without further ado:

***Eating and Eating Healthy***

* **Eat a decent amount before your pill**. You need a healthy, high protein breakfast before your meds. Some say to eat as much as possible, but I'd argue against that. You need to be eating throughout the day, especially on Vyvanse, as food helps to release it. Eating until you're stuffed will get you through part of the day, but it only makes it harder to keep up a regular eating habit.

* **Liquid Calories.** If you really can't make yourself eat, but you know you should, try for some liquid calories. A protein smoothie or something like [Ensure](http://abbottnutrition.com/products/ensure-plus) is a great way. I especially love Ensure, because it is lactose safe. I've since grown out of my lactose intolerance, but these things go down really smooth. Heavy dairy isn't the greatest for upset stomachs, so I highly, highly recommend picking up a few. Tastes like chocolate milk!

* **Drink lots of water**! Even if you don't feel thirsty. You should be drinking 1 1/2 to 3 litres a day *without* medicine. I scrape at least one and a half, and it's almost guaranteed that I'm small than you. You can do it! If you get that tired of water, a glass of [Crystal Light](http://www.kraftcanada.com/en/products/a-c/crystallight2.aspx) is a nice break. I especially love the iced tea. It's better than Nestle in moderation.


* **Peanut Butter** is great for upset stomachs. Some peanut butter and toast twenty minutes before your pill helps a lot, especially with Strattera. 

* **Multi-vitamins**. It's widely accepted that your eating goes to crap on these medications. A [One a Day](http://www.oneaday.com/) or something like that should be good. I've heard to stay away from too much Vitamin C though, as it can affect the absorption of Vyvanse, at least.

* **Eat a high-protein, high calorie snack every three hours or so.** I went to the bulk barn and made up my own trail mix: peanuts, cashews, pretzels, dried bananas, and almonds. Definitely have some fruit. Granola/clif bars etc. are great too. (thanks someonefarted) For people with allergies, I've heard good cheese and fruit are excellent as well. Vyvanse depends on food to work properly, so a small snack every few hours will keep your medicine working well.

* **Incense.** So this is really weird, but incense helps with my appetite immensely. I discovered it by accident today. Wasn't hungry at all, then decided I would burn some of Mandarin [orange] incense oil. About ten minutes in, I was starving! Ate a large snack after that one. 

* **Cut out the junk food.** I stopped drinking pop (I was at two or three a day) cold turkey, and after a few days the caffeine headaches went away, and I'm feeling much better overall. I cut out chips, ramen, and [for the most part] things like bagel bites. If you're trying to gain weight, do it healthy. You'll naturally crave fatty foods to make up for it, but don't indulge too often. Eating rarely **and** poorly will make both your physical and mental health worse. Google "high calorie foods" to get some great ideas for healthy meals. 

* **Make your food appetizing**.  (courtesy schmin!) [\(My start on a collection of easy, healthy gourmet recipes.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rq57t/what_should_we_add_to_the_faq_or_im_tired_of/c483md4)

***Exercising***

* **Daily exercise is highly recommended.** My workout is upper body and core on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Lower body and cardio is on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I average about forty minutes a day. Now, I don't pretend to be any sort of expert on this, so here I'm only really recommending what to look up. /r/Fitness is a wonderful resource. I'm not naturally inclined to athleticism, thus I find it very hard to motivate myself. So:

* **Get a buddy!**  Find a friend to work out with. It motivates you to go when you don't want to. And it's always easier (and safer!) with a friend. 

* **Schedules.** I know, easily one of our worst enemies. I have trouble following set times, so what I do is pick a time slot of about half an hour. I have to start within that half hour. It gives me a little leeway if there's something I want to finish first. Nothing is worse than being interrupted! As well, a good buddy will help you stay on track. 

* **A quick note of concern.** It is risky to exercise if you're not eating properly. You **must** have something to eat and let it sit before you workout. And use some discretion/common sense; if that's the first time you've eaten in two days, it's not enough. Keep eating, then get back to it later. **It's better to skip a workout than to do it on an empty stomach.** If you have a buddy, let them know to watch for your eating. They may need to remind you. Just because you don't feel hungry, doesn't mean you aren't. Make sure to eat after too! Even just a good protein shake.

* **Water.** You better be drinking lots! I drink just under a litre every time I work out. And I am small! You bigger lads best be drinking more than that.

***Final Notes***

I am running out of word space! I really hope this helps. I have depression as well and these tips are great for your overall happiness. It's amazing how such little things help so much. It fixes sleeping problems too. If trees aren't your thing these tips are especially helpful. I've cut down a tonne on my smoking since starting this.

edit: woohoo, I got a label! Make your food **appetizing**.

 So far, all I'd really been doing was setting meal alarms for myself. These are much better ideas for me. Thanks! I always carry some granola bars, I believe i'm going through some Kashi bars right now.  They have some great nutrients and taste delicious.  It's not a lot but it definitely helps and it's better than nothing.

I also love buying a 5 dollar fruit bowl from publix and finish it before the day is over.   Thanks friend, I picked up some ensure high calorie shakes tonight.

Been having trouble lately making the effort to eat even if I make food in bulk thats an easy reheat. Jesus, lets swap problems. When my medication wears off, im eating like a fat fat fat guy. And suddenly im turning into one. :/ Maybe its because I convinced myself years ago to "eat fucking eat dude!!" and now I cant stop. I moved in to my parents a few months ago, just for the spring, but food is delicious and FREE! FREE FOOD! Gained more than 15 lbs.

Anyways, whats like...if I would get another pill when my extraordinary appetite starts? Would this "kill" my problem? Excellent point, added! Thanks!  You're welcome! This is why I wrote it. If you wouldn't mind, I'd love some feedback if you do go through with some of these. And if you have anything else to add too. Totally forgot about granola/clif bars etc. Thank you! I like them too, they're a great snack for on the go. Even before my medication I liked to eat them while walking to school or something. They take the edge off hunger nausea too.   Well I really hope those help. I'm having that problem too. It's not really about how easy it is to *make* the food. It's actually forcing yourself to eat it. I lived off those ensures for a few days when I had the stomach flu, and couldn't even keep down bread. Try not to rely on them though, please eat as well! If you don't mind a suggestion, I'd suggest:

*  eating a good meal in the morning before your pill
*  have an ensure for lunch if you're not feeling up to eating
*  high energy snack
* whatever you can manage for dinner
* a good meal once your meds wind down. 

I tend to get really hungry around 9:30, when my meds are done for the day. I force myself to eat a small portion with my family at a normal time, then the rest when I'm genuinely hungry. It's not the best to eat so late, but it's probably better than not eating in two days, I think. Which happened :P You're welcome.  You did complicate my nick, tho.  =P

I would also add, choose exercise you find *enjoyable* whether it's a social exercise class, or a meditative yoga, or a class that teaches you dancing...these double duty things make it easier to look forward to! Sound advice. I've only been on meds for coming up on 3 months so it's still a learning process.

Thank-you dammit, I even double checked, sorry! I :P copied and pasted it this time, so it should be better now
