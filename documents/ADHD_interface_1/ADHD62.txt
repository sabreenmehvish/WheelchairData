My DIY planner is helping my ADHD more than I thought possible. Pictures inside. **IMPORTANT EDIT: Links to a blank copy are at the bottom!  Enjoy!**

**EDIT 2: August pages are ready [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4v1uvu/diy_planner_pages_for_august/)!**

Hey friends!  I wanted to share my custom planner set-up here in case it helps anyone else.  Along with medication, this tool has been an amazing help for my ADHD brain.

Here's some background, but if you want to skip it, the pictures are at the bottom.

**Background**

I'm a graduate student and have a lot of unstructured time, long/fuzzy deadlines, and huge intimidating tasks.  Procrastination and hyperfocused all-nighters had always gotten me through by the skin of my teeth (along with skipping housework, self-care, & any kind of social life).  I got diagnosed last year when I started feeling like I was about to hit the wall, hard.  Medication helped, but I still had a ton of anxiety/resistance related to starting and sustaining work on big tasks, maintaining routines, etc.

I've never been able to use a storebought planner...I get put off by some section I don't want to use, or some feature I wish it had, and I just stop.  I've also tried various apps but nothing really helps for long.  

I am a huge project person, and usually my projects last for a few days/weeks and then my motivation and interest dries up.  By some amazing magic, one day I got really INTO the idea of making a custom planner.  

For me, this is basically a perfect hobby.  I can buy nice pens, fiddle around with fonts & other design stuff, and brainstorm what's working and what's not.  I started in MS Word and eventually converted it all to an InDesign layout.  Every month, I tweak the design so I always have something to iterate on.  I just can't believe how much I enjoy this as a project!  I feel like I hijacked some core part of my brain that always works against me, and figured out how to harness its power for good.

It might not work forever, but it's been working since April, which is far longer than I've ever stuck with an organizational system.

**Pictures**

Enough text.  Here are an album with pictures of the pages from each different section.  It starts with the cover, then a monthly section, weekly section, and daily section.  Bonus picture of my pen roll at the end.  Who knew that stockpiling pens could be a legit productivity aid??  Mmm.

I hope this helps some of you kindred spirits out there.  I'm happy to answer questions etc.  Thanks!

**EDIT:**  Thanks so much for your positive comments!!  It's really encouraging.  I'm working on converting the pages to fillable forms in Acrobat and should have July's pages ready to share soon.  I can also share the InDesign file for any nerds like me that might want to play with it. <3

-----

**EDIT 2:**  July's pages are ready to share!  I did some condensing from the file I usually print from, so please let me know if anything's not working.  These are half-page sized and set up for double-sided printing.  I have set up a form fillable PDF as well as a blank one, and have the packaged InDesign file here as well.

* [July planner pages - blank PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0v3azk5pu0ylmx/July%202016%20-%20blank%20pages%20for%20reddit.pdf?dl=0)

Here's how I'd recommend printing the pages (sorry, this will be a wordy explanation...I'm not sure how to get across how to print double-sided in the easiest way):

1. Page 1 (daily log) - print two copies of this page double-sided, to get four daily sheets to a page.

2. Pages 2-9 are the weekly pages.  Each week has 1 calendar, 1 weekly overview, and 2 task planning pages.  Pages 2-3 should be back to back double-sided, then 4-5, 6-7, and 8-9.

3. Pages 10-13 are the monthly pages.  Just like with the weekly pages, print 10-11 back to back, and 12-13 back to back.  The Inbox page is blank on the back (I just stick this in the very front as a note-taking aid) but the rest will come out double-sided.

4. I also included a few pages that I'm playing around with -- a page for lists, & a page for notes.  Those are on pages 14 & 15.

5. For fun, I included the cover (it's just a strip that I cut out and glued to my cover) with the name of the month.

**EDIT 3:**  A few more details/links about how you can duplicate the planner pictured, by request!

* I used [90lb index stock](https://www.amazon.com/Neenah-Exact-Index-Sheets-40311/dp/B006P1EQIA/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_img_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=G4DQH1X568SC8T8TC27H).  I wanted a cardstock feel, not too much bulk, and no bleed through with felt tip pens.

* The pages themselves are designed to be printed 2 across, on 8.5x11 pages, double-sided.  I cut them in half for a finished page size of 8.5x5.5.  [These mini tab dividers](https://www.amazon.com/Avery-Plastic-Durable-Dividers-16180/dp/B0045Z4PGQ) work well & are what I use.  Make sure you read reviews of any mini dividers etc. that you buy online...I ordered a set of pocket dividers a while back, but they were too short and the tabs didn't stick out.

* The coil binding I used is called Proclick.  I linked this earlier, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_SQFbMdmc) shows how it works pretty well.  The binding is a soft plastic and can be cut down to any size you want with regular scissors.  I use the [5/8 diameter spines](http://www.mybinding.com/gbc-5-8-proclick-spines.html?sku=25156691), which are the largest available.  For whatever reason, the navy ones are the cheapest than the others.  [Here's a link](https://www.amazon.com/GBC-ProClick-Desktop-Binding-Machine/dp/B00006IAS3) to the binding machine.  It's a little pricey, but you can find it used sometimes for a good price.  It does *not* punch through cardboard etc...I punched the cover manually with a single hole punch. [deleted] When you are done with the .pdf you could sell these on Etsy! I searched ADHD planners on there recently and there was nothing. I would spend months on this tweaking and obsessing over every color, and font, and border, and do I use a check box or circle? Do I also need a meal planning section or should that be it's own thing? I could go on and on and drive myself insane.... or I could buy yours! I am eagerly awaiting the link. It's really a fantastic planner! 

I collect them avidly- which is a problem in that I tend to collect them more avidly than I use them.

Good for you for sticking to it! I have stuck to mine a lot better lately and I am learning to use it more functionally. I used to spend HOURS creating the perfect layout and every list imaginable and then totally forget to use it. Or worse, I would skip adding things for fear of screwing up the aesthetic...

You really did a lovely job in every aspect here- one of the best layouts I have ever seen.  That is fantastic!!

Two questions, do you get this professionally printed every month, or do you just print it at home. And secondly, are you able to share the file so that others could use this!? It looks like a fantastic tool Oooooooo. It's pretty! I bet you could sell this quite easily! I do basically this, but I draw it all by hand (sort of a modified bullet journal approach), because I don't have any idea how to get a journal bound and printed to this level of quality.  I can make graphics to my satisfaction- just not figure out how to turn them into a journal like this.  Can you help me out by explaining what you do? This is AWESOME!!!

My only suggestion would be to add an expected amount of time and actual amount of time tasks take. This has helped me really deal with being "time blind".


Excellent work!

Also: would you be willing to share some more specifics? Size and weight of paper used, part number for the rings binding, etc?

Thanks!! This is amazing (and making a similar one is on my to-do list). What program did you use? deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0178  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/51430) Fucking AMAZING. Also shout-out to Staedtler triplus.

I would so pay for that planner. Holy jesus, you can make millions off of this. A monthly subscription service that delivers beautiful ADHD tailored Planners.  I know a fellow INTJ when I see one.  Where did you get the canvas roll of hilighters? Also I need this pdf in my life. !Remindme 4 days Dreamboat post of the day. I'm always tweaking my planner!

Thanks for the visuals!! That's super cute!! I use the Franklin Planner system (have used it for YEARS). I think using that dead tree planner system is what allowed me to "cope" and go undiagnosed for so much of my life. One thing that sets the Franklin Planner system apart is the fact that it is Personal Mission/Personal Values based with the idea that you first establish your values, then establish your goals based on those values. It supports weekly planning and daily planning to ensure you make time for the things that are most important to you. So, it's not so much about rigidly scheduling your time, but really, truly prioritizing and understanding what is most important to you. The planner is at http://www.franklinplanner.com and I also recommend the book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey for more information about values-based planning. I've been flirting with the idea of doing my own planner pages for this system, thanks for more inspiration in that area! What size paper is this? This is great :) I just started a bullet journal and it's a nice, relaxing way to plan. I do get a little overwhelmed by how beautiful other people's bullet journals are, but I love how the community is accepting of mistakes and has lots of inspiration.  OMG THAT IS BEAUTIFUL! Sorry, I'm a bit of a planner/color addict. :P

Also, awesome that there's finally something out there designed with the ADHD brain in mind. The few that I could find that might be didn't seem to be designed by people with ADHD and they just didn't have all the little things that you put in here. They could be modified but they weren't *quite* all there.

**Question:** Where did you get the spine? And/or what is it called (brand or whatever)? 'Cause that's exactly what I've been looking for *forever.* This looks great! Do you find it defficult to fill in the daily logs as they are not right next to their week? I think (for me at least) it could be better if the daily logs had dates already on them, and were placed right after the corresponding weekly planner. 
 
Are you familiar with the Passion Planner? 
It is the planner I currently use, and yours has some elements in common and some that I think could be a good add to theirs.

Perhaps you could cooperate with them to create the ultimate planner?  This is. So. Good. 
If you want you could upload this stuff (if you own everything) on a blog and let related (adhd and more) blogs link to it. It deserves the exposure, it's super useful! This is amazing. You might want to also share it with /r/gradschool as I feel like most grad students would benefit greatly from it! Now you need to get into fountain pens. It will make using your planner even more fun :) Thank you for sharing this! I use the Passion Planner, which I love, but it's still not totally right for everything I need to do and remember in a day/week/month. I'm going to borrow some of your excellent ideas, and maybe look at incorporating your planner/methods into 2017 (since I already have my PP for 2016). Also: Gelly Roll Pens are AMAZING if you need allthecolors and allthepens like I do. :) 
edit: typo.
 All right, that's it for Reddit today.  I gave myself permission to spend 5 minutes before starting on my massive list of errands and tasks.

The first and only thread I opened has the world's perfect ADHD planner available for free.   I have downloaded the PDF and now I'm going to close this browser and print a page.  Thank you, friend. I have an electronic system that I use, also based on GTD methodology.

But I think paper is better. You are forced to think things more thoroughly before committing on paper vs digital.

Will give it a try, thank you!  I'm a new user on this sub, and I have pretty severe ADHD, along with Aspergers. Quite the joyous combo. I really love that you share this, but I'm still unable to get a proper overview of all of this planner. I look at the first part, and when I scroll down, I'm completely blank. Once I've gone through it all? Might as well start over :/ I hope people get this to work for them, but it's way too "advanced" for my brain :( Thanks for sharing though, I'm sure it'll give me some ideas for making my own planner along with my psychologist! :) I find that visualizing and planning out the day avoids problems, for example, by ensuring I plan for travel time, prep time.
If I have a 2 pm appt. I plan the amount of travel time and then write leave by:      . Also, listing what I need to prepare and/or take is crucial, and when that has to be done by makes my day run seamlessly. I also group activities and chores for efficiency.

Keeping a check on complexity and maintaining momentum work best for me. I try to recognize my hesitancy and what it means, but then keep going. I like recipe cards. Really nicely done.

I see many people suggestion a wide variety of different ways to plan and schedule their daily activities, but what matters the most is having a schedule/planner that works for the individual. Each person has to find a way to personalize it and make it there own so they feel very happy with what they have going for them. Looks like the Bullet Journal on steroids :) I just ordered mine and I'm hoping it can help me stay more organized. Love your idea though! I would imagine the personal touch and creation forces you to stay more consistent with it. Looks great! The office supply collecting and design stuff is what keeps this engaging for me too. I've started a hybrid long form/ bullet journal and it's fun so far. Definitely need to be mindful of getting sucked into the prettifying aspect though. [deleted] This planner looks absolutely STUNNING. I'd love to have a copy! Great idea with the pens too! Nice. Awesome planner. I like how it combines tasks, strategies, and tactics with self-reflection. Nice job. can I steal this and make it my own?  This is...awesome This is amazing! I love this! Great great great amazing job! Thank you so much for sharing!  Absolute bloody Legend! Wow. wOW. This... this feels almost pornographic. Gorgeous. I think I'm going to have to adapt this somehow. Inspirational. This is the best thing I have ever come acrossed.  FYI, if you are at all interested, someone did a Kickstarter for a planner. If you have the urge, you might could do that. 

Or, again if you have the inkling, release a generic version of the files (with a copyright or copyleft notation).  This actually just motivated me to get up and start using my planners again...if I can find them.  This is great! Thanks for sharing. :) These are beautiful. Wow.  May I kiss you? Gender (or lack thereof) doesn't matter to me. That is gorgeous.

ETA: Ripplemon above suggested selling these. That is a very, very good idea. I would buy. This is amazing. 

!remindme 24houra You should sell these, because if you don't, somebody else will. I cannot thank you enough for sharing this! Your background and inspiration for making this is something that hits close to home with me. 

I honestly think you could sell these, and I for one know I would purchase them. Until then, I look forward to making my own.

Amazing. Remindme¡ blah blah blah I am printing now. I'm also in grad school, finishing in December. Am also a single mom, and we want to move to another city to start our new life. So between now and then, I have to finish projects, apply and interview for jobs, look for housing in new city, and figure out the school application system for the kid. (You apply in wintertime for the next year of school, and must prove residency..) All on top of doing normal grad school stuff.

This planner could not have come at a more perfect time, thank you. Also, your comment about the ADHD brain only thinking in terms of "now" and "later" explains a whole lot of my problems. Thank you so much! This is awesome! Glad you shared it!  RemindMe! "MESSAGE" THIS IS AMAZING!

Send me a PM when you're ready to start selling these and we'll promote the crap outta them! omg. this is everything I've ever wanted I am getting ready to meet with the school for my kid's 504 plan to start the school year. One of the accommodations he gets is a custom planner and I will incorporate some items like "big goals/small goals" , "Hard Things" , "Rituals" and "Balance". Thank you again for sharing this! I cant seem to get the files open. It tells me corrupt/cannot open. What is the best app to open this in? Or is there a way to fix it somehow?
 hello!

Thank you so much for posting this, I have been looking for something like this for so long...

Unfortunately, I am the biggest InDesign noob and I have no idea where to begin editing this for August.

How do you change the sizes of the blue boxes around everything? And the pretty July title, I realise that's made up of two 'July's overlapping each other, but I can't edit the purple and orange July box underneath... i have to echo the sentiments of others and say thanks for sharing such an amazing planner. you did an amazing job! I came back to this post to say thank you! I've been using the planner since you posted it and have even learned to use InDesign in order to personalize it and to create more ways to organize my life. This has been extremely useful and has absolutely increased my day-to-day/overall productivity. I've really enjoyed learning to use it. I finally feel somewhat prepared for my next year of college. Thank you SO much! [deleted] It blows my mind that no one has made a planner geared to ADHD folks yet. I find the passion planner to be the closest thing but even that's still not designed with us in mind.

OP is really sweet and generous to share this with everyone.  Thanks!

To your first question, I print it at home.  I started w/ black and white on colored paper, then ended up needing a new printer so got a color laserjet which I do all this on now.  I print all the pages on cardstock to prevent the pens bleeding through.

To your second question -- I'd be happy to!  I'll need some time to clean up the file but then I'll share it here.  It might also be cool to figure out how to set it up as a PDF form so people can fill in their own text...not sure how to do that, but I'll look into it. Thanks so much, that's a really sweet compliment!  For now I'm happy just sharing it for free.  This is my favorite sub and the community is so fantastic.  You guys are my people! I would 100% buy a planner like this.  I'd buy one every year. I don't have a printer or laptop, just a smart phone. It would be way more convenient for me to be able to purchase. If you ever decide to mass produce, I'm in!  Sure!  I use tables in InDesign (MS Word also works).  I design half-pages, place them in a full page w/ the left and right margins set up for my printer and hole punch, and then print the full page double-sided so it works like a book.  I cut the pages apart so there's a wider margin on the side I want to punch.  

* [Full page](http://imgur.com/s7y3TEI) (this is an extra I re-printed because it came out crooked)
 
* [Half page punched](http://imgur.com/gSYuZZ3)
 
* [Half page with spine](http://imgur.com/ze7zeWu)

I print them at home on a super cheap color laserjet.  I have to manually flip the pages to get double-sided printing which is currently the worst part of this whole thing.  But it turns out OK so it's been worth it.

For binding -- I spent a lot of time figuring out how I wanted this to work.  Initially I used a 3-hole punch and mini binder (it's basically A5 size which is half a standard page), but I started feeling annoyed by trying to write on the left side and having binder rings in the way.  I also wanted to be able to fold the cover back around like a spiral notebook, and wanted to be able to move the daily pages to the back when I finished them so I didn't get bogged down by clutter.

What I settled on is these little clicky spines (edited to add a [link](http://www.mybinding.com/binding/binding-supplies/gbc-proclick.html)) that can separate when you pull them apart, and the punch machine that fits them (it also works with the usual spiral coil binding you've probably seen).  [This is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk_SQFbMdmc) that sold me on this system.  I promise I don't work for that company...I'm just sharing what I found because there is a LOT out there and this fit my very picky needs.  Honorable mentions would be disc binding systems like Circa/Arc.

I use tab dividers for each section.  You can buy A5 dividers in office supply stores, which is what I'm currently using (just re-punched for my binding).  I've tried making my own dividers as well. You can take it to staples and have them print it and bind it for you. If you want to be able to add/remove pages, the have a system called ARC that uses plastic discs for binding and has a special hole punch available.

I print my own planner inserts at home on 28lb paper (or better) and use a hole punch to put them in to a binder style planner. You can get them inexpensively from places like target or walmart in varying sizes.

Those are just a few options that I have come across, as I am not sure what OP did to bind this planner- it's amazing looking! Thanks!  Good suggestions -- I added a few more specifics to the OP in an edit.  Hope that helps!  Let me know if you want any additional details. Thanks!  I started with tables in Word, but it got fiddly real fast (Word doesn't handle complex tables as well as I'd like for this).  After that, I recreated it in Adobe InDesign, & that's what I've been using since then.  InDesign also makes it easier to change document colors & fonts based on stylesheets, so I don't need to do it all totally by hand every month. Thanks!!  I started with just the daily page (that was what got me into the project in the first place...the need to remember to eat and shower and stuff, ha).  It grew from there kind of organically as I figured out what was clicking for my brain and what wasn't.

What I didn't include was all the pages that I've designed that I haven't ended up using at all.  It's interesting how that happens.  Sometimes you come up with something you think will really work and then it just....doesn't really fit somehow.  It's got to evolve with what I need, which lets me tinker to the degree that I love. Came here to say this. I would absolutely pay for a subscription service for the pages to come each month, or in 3 month packs (Like Field Notes) I'm stunned! Good guess - you're dead on. Not OP, but a pen dork and immediately recognized them as my own favorites: 

[Staedtler Pens](https://smile.amazon.com/Staedtler-Triplus-Fineliner-Porous-334/dp/B0007OEDYI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1468612809&sr=8-3&keywords=staedtler+pens)

[Pen Rolls](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Doffice-products&field-keywords=pen+wrap) +1 for Staedtler and Le Pen!

I also like the [Japanese](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Frixion-Colors-SFC-120M12C-japan/dp/B004ECLQHQ/ref=sr_1_22?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1468617340&sr=1-22&keywords=frixion) Frixion pens because they're erasable! They're not fine point, which stinks, but they're felt tip! I hate gel pens :/ The ink will also disappear if it gets too hot! So if you live in a very warm climate, they may not be for you. Haha.

Also, if you are feeling lucky and you search through the dirt cheap pen sets on Amazon, some of them turn out to be REALLY awesome. I've found a few of my favorite pen sets that! Definitely had my share of duds though...  You can find canvas pencil rolls on Amazon (they're not sold w/ the pens, just the elastic loops for them to go in) in tons of different fabrics.  For the pens, I'm using Staedtler and Le Pen fineliner pens...they are beyond fabulous.  I highly recommend hitting up your local art store so you can doodle with the open stock pens and find ones that write in a way you like.  I like these because they don't make that scratching sound on the paper that a lot of felt tip pens do. I will be messaging you on [**2016-07-19 19:34:28 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2016-07-19 19:34:28 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4t0l7q/my_diy_planner_is_helping_my_adhd_more_than_i/d5dpex3)

|-|-|-|-|-|-| The files I shared are designed to print on 8.5x11 paper, then cut in half (for a finished size of 8.5x5.5).   Thanks so much!! I really appreciate it.  I definitely felt like I needed a planner that was ADHD-brain-specific, y'know?

I just added a few links to the OP with specific supplies, including the binding & how it works.  If you need more info, let me know! Go for it!  Thanks!  I'm pretty happy just sharing the PDFs for each month as I make them for myself, but it would be great if I could sort out a print on demand setup for people who can't or don't want to print/assemble something like this by hand. Hmm...If you're downloading the zip file, that's an InDesign package and requires that software to open. The other files are PDFs and can be opened with Acrobat Reader or another PDF viewer. They still look fine from my end, so as long as you have the right software and it's up to date, I'm not sure why you can't open them. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4518  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/36559) oh man, your humor is so spot on. i know this post is old but i've been looking for a good planner to start the academic year off right (i work in a school) and not only am i amazed by this diy awesomeness, but i can't help but comment on your wit.

stupid sexy flanders : ) Why not use a regular day planner? How would the ADHD day planner differ? If you have Adobe Acrobat (not Adobe Reader), you can make this into a form by drawing boxes in each area that people will need to fill out. Alternately, you could post a blank planner and we could just hand-write the lines in ourselves. I love this planner, it reminds me of the Passion Planner but you've tailored it so well! Could I have a copy as well? This is just GREAT! Is there a way to edit the pages so we can modify it for the months?
I wish I could give you Reddit gold to express how much this means to me. I think this might be the tool that can help me get my life back together. 

It's been so troublesome to plan because there are so many different phases to the stages, but you've so nicely compiled them together. Thank you so much. I love your planner so much! Ive been looking for hardcopy planners for so long. I never thought to make one custom. What program did you use to create it? I wouldn't mind spending some time formatting it so everyone could use it as a base. I'm  so happy you are willing to share this- I'm looking forward for an update as I seem to do better with physical planners that you write in versus electronic versions. I would also love to have a copy of the InDesign file to play with, once you have it ready! I tried making my own from scratch a long, long time ago but lost interest...modifying a pre-created file would probably be a lot easier =) Nice. Just chiming in that it looks awesome and I'd love a copy. :)

I do need to google InDesign though, never heard of it. You are a star! Thanks a lot for all the work you put into this! This is great. Honestly if it was worth it on your end and you could put something like this together with a Kinko's spiral bind I'd probably be willing to pay $100 for a year's worth. Could be b&w but prefer a heavier paper. Well, just like you're happy sharing it for free, some people will be happy paying for it to avoid having to put it together themself or simply just to support you. So would I be able to use the system to re-bind and add pages to an existing planner? My planner's plastic spiral binding is partially broken and I'm only half way through it. It was a gift and I really like the features it does have, so I don't want to throw it out but it would be awesome if I could fix it and add to it!

Ps: please do share the files for this when you can, it seems really practical and well designed! I'm a sucker for stuff like this. Lol This is awesome, thank you so much for the detailed reply!  This is going to save me so much time every month. I used to make notebooks professionally for museum shops, and bought all of my supplies at the same place. Really reputable company and pretty fast shipping too!

Quick questions: 

* How well do the clicky spines function if you open/close them often? 
* What size spines do you use (not pitch, but diameter)? I downloaded InDesign's free trial to try and play with it myself. I'm having trouble editing the Monthly Log, since sides the Monthly Calendar, it's like the one thing that doesn't exactly fit image wise since the Week dividers don't make sense for August. 

I figured out that with the Text tool you can add/delete rows and columns, but how did you get some of the lines row lines to be thick to symbolize the end of a week?

And also, do you change the font and color scheme for different months? Or is that too much work? Beware that the papers for the disc systems (like ARC) fall out all the time. It's SO SAD when your monthly checklist ends up blowing into a puddle dog pee on the street (yes, that happened).  I'm an expert at Quark, but quickly learning InDesign in my new job. PROJECT!!! I seriosly think it's a great business idea. You should sell it in sections, so that the planner is customizable because every (ADHD-)brain is different. With the right marketing (focusing on the individual and how fun it is) it could really be a hit! It could be build your ow planner kind of a thing, with different cover designs and accessories (like page markers, rulers that snaps into it, plastic pockets). Why not buy a regular day planner? How does a ADHD one differ?
 Oh my god 0.3mm I'm in love. Thank you! YES....Pilot Frixions have saved my life! 

BTW - If your ink disappears, you can stick your notebook in the freezer and everything will come back. I found 4-color frixion pens on Amazon, which use a skinnier ink tube. In searching for refills, I found that they make a 0.38 mm extra fine refill! So now I have a 4-color extra-fine gel ink erasable pen!! It's my favorite possession. Thank you, Amazon! Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerfect :D I might try this.... You are amazing. I just don't have words.

This planner is so ADHD specific. You hit on everything I have problems with, and everything I've been trying to fix, etc.

I stopped trying to make my own planner because I kept getting discouraged by nothing working and having to re-draw it every day. (Didn't have a printer; finally got one now and can't hook it up to my computer.)

I've been using apps and found some good ones but sometimes you just need to **write** things down to get them out of your head.

This planner is just so beautiful and you're so awesome for sharing and I just don't have enough words to express awesome you are.

Lol sorry for the gushing. :P something about a regular planner doesn't work with my brain............................. Thanks so much!  Working on it now & should have it up soon. Sure!  It'll take a little tweaking on my end but that's fine.  I want to get a PDF for August posted soon, so I can also set up a file using a sort of generic layout at that point. It's done!  Why not buy a regular day planner? How does a ADHD one differ? You might be able to!  I've learned way more than I ever wanted to about bindings during this project (heh, that alone is a very ADHD thing to say).  Here's some info that might help:

Bindings have a measurement called the pitch, which is basically the ratio of holes per inch.  The Proclick binding that I use has a 3:1 pitch and can be cut with regular scissors down to whatever page size you need.  So if your existing planner is bound w/ 3:1 pitch binding, you could just get these spines and slide em right in.

Now, you might not get lucky and have it match exactly.  I've had to adapt things to the binding that I use sometimes (e.g. my tab dividers were punched for a 3-ring binder).  So if it's not 3:1 pitch, you could do a couple different things:

1. Rebind it with a new spiral coil (I think the copy center of an office supply store could probably just rebind it for you for a minimal cost).  The only downside about spiral coils is that you can't easily add/remove pages, but if you don't need to do that, it's really convenient.

2. Re-punch the pages so they fit whatever binding you want to switch to.  You could replace the planner cover w/ a mini binder and just use a regular 3-hole punch (lots of them let you adjust where the punches line up).  

 I have to do this with things like tab dividers which are already punched, so what I do is just tape the edge I'm re-punching with permanent tape.  For thick stock like the cardboard cover I made, I use a regular single hole punch since the Proclick punch machine doesn't have enough oomph to punch through anything like that. Regarding the plastic spiral binding, you might be able to take that to a print/repro shop and have them re-bind it for you. They hold up pretty well opening and closing them a lot, but I would probably still want extras on hand.  Still, I have used the same spine for maybe 2 months? and it's still holding up really well.  They come with a little easy open/close tool, which isn't necessary but does make it much easier, and I think using it probably lengthens the life of the spine over manually popping it open.

I am currently using the 5/8 diameter spines.  They are the length of a letter page, but you can cut them down to whatever size you need with ordinary scissors.  They're a good size for the number of pages I have (~40 sheets, which I print on 90lb index stock, and 5 tab dividers) with a little extra room.  I have a very thick cover which adds a bit of bulk & it accommodates it all well. True story! I won't use anything but a binder style planner- except passion planners but I still put those in to compendiums. I take apart Happy Planners and put them in to binders because I really hate disc systems. Sooooo many people love them though, so they can't be all bad!  That's exactly why I've hesitated using the disc systems. I'm so afraid that something will fall off. I live in NY so I haven't had this happen to me yet but that's good to know! Haha. Thank you! You are so sweet! :D Let me know if you use it & how it goes. Thank you so much for sharing this! I am starting vet school in August, and I am hoping this will help me keep my ducks in a row as I'm re-adjusting to the school/studying/project grind. I just have one silly question, because I haven't used Indesign since I was in high school. On the 'Recurring Things' page, I'm trying to remove the red x from the week 5 column, but I can't seem to do it. Is there an easy way that I can do that? I'm using CS6 if that helps. Thank you again for taking the time to post all of this! Oh please let us know when both come out. I haven't felt this hopeful in a long time.  Thank you so much! I'm going with option 2. It might make the transition to a more structured planner easier. 

 I decided to get the Mead Organizher Shopping Companion, 5.5 x 8.5 Inches, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GE4I92W/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_ACBIxbJ5Q7GV8

I just can't afford a cool new hole punch plus materials right now. I probably won't use it for its original purpose, but it's the perfect size. It has pockets and other useful stuff, and I'll be able to make new pages with what I already have!
Can't wait to get to work on this! Thanks for your help.
 Thanks for responding! I didn't think about the fact that you can just switch out the binding if you need to. :) I'm imagining these are people that leave them on their desk all the time or rarely move the papers. Once you move the papers a couple of times, they never stay in the same way again. :( Yes - it's a dangerous thing! This happened to me while I was living in NYC. I swear, sometimes that city is out to destroy us! I think I'm going to steal bits from it and draw it out on graph paper, and see how that works for now.

You've inspired me, and I've got some ideas cooking in my head for a hybrid system for myself. You reminded me that I need to track stress, sleep, adhd symptoms, etc. And also some other stuff as well like breaking down tasks into chunks, etc.

I'm definitely still going to need apps, both because they make noise/vibrate/flash/harass me, and also because of lack of access to a printer, and no dinero for buying the binding machine (yet).

If/when I can make it all work, I definitely will update. (Probably as a new post though, if I can get a full system going. :P) Oh sure!  I have InDesign CC so I'm not sure if it's different -- but if you highlight the cells that are X'd out, you should be able to select Cell Options and then there's a section in that dialog box for diagonal lines.  You can just switch them off there.  On mine, it takes a minute to refresh that for some reason, just a heads-up in case you find it but it doesn't seem to work right away. Sweet!!  I think there's a huge advantage in having it be your own project to mull over and tinker with to your exact specifications.  You'll have to post what you come up with! That worked perfectly. Thanks for the help! Indesign has changed a lot in the past eight years, but I'm starting to remember some of the old tricks. You're the best!
