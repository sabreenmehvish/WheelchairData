What Other ADHD Forums Do You Use? I'm looking for more extended conversations than Reddit's format really allows.  Sort of a message board layout.  What ones do you like? /r/pokemon I never became active there (/r/adhd is distraction enough, thank you), but I've found a lot of good content on [addforums.com](http://www.addforums.com/). I believe it's considerably larger and older than this subreddit, so it's useful for finding good archived community discussions of less common topics. longecity.com http://www.feingold.org/
