After upping the dosage, whats my problem? TL;DR My dosage was upped, but I still feel like I am losing the battle. Very distraught 

I went from 55mg to 2 x 36 in the morning. I have noticed a *slight* change in attention and behavior, but sometimes in class it doesn't feel like it at all. I may have had near-perfect attention for 5-10 minutes, drifting once or twice before I corrected my self, but now I feel like I just zone out of the lesson. When I zone out, my mind starts racing, then it will hit a certain point and I start to hyperfocus on it. It usually goes like this:  

*  What scene should I try to recreate in C4D later? 
*  How about a flowing ocean with a boat? 
* Hyperfocus for a few minutes on how to do the scene  
* Slight hiccup, something I don't know how to do, forget what I was doing, I need to figure out this hiccup 
* Come up with a solution, but now...I dont want to do that scene, how about this?
* Nah, lets try to disect how X website did their layout  
* They did this, or that, no this, probably this. - Then I go into GREAT detail on their process, until I get stuck and thennnn
* Hey, I like this style, how could I adopt or recreate this the school districts website, or how would I work with my teacher on this  
* I dont know, but this could be a great product idea. 
* Oh my gosh, if I see this person again and they say something, I don't think I will be able to hold back, I need to avoid them.
* yeah, what ev, make sure you check with nick, his back was hurting after practice yesterday. 

Heres the mind boggling thing, this entire process is about 3-5 minutes. I don't know what to do, I'm worried I wont be able to pursue my dreams, enter the military, or get my ADHD under control. Do I need a higher dosage? My grades suffered horribly last year because of this, everyone tells me: You're a genius, you are leagues ahead most of these people in terms of what you love (computers, technology in general). School just isn't right for you. 

For the most part, I laugh and agree with them. But that isn't the world we live in, I need to be focused on school, otherwise, I will never be able to do what I love to do, am I losing the battle to my ADHD? 
Info:

So possibly when you get out of school, pursue those activities, and make great headway on them. So maybe next time you're in school, you won't be thinking about it. 

You will find that it quite hard to only focus on school when you're in school. So have some system to take note of the ideas you get in class for time outside of class. This does two things. 1) you recognize you're losing attention and hopefully writing the idea down will allow you to focus on it later and 2) it help you not forget what you wanted to get done after school. 

Good luck.
