Can anyone give me some advice with this problem I have? Small amount of back story
From the UK
22
Studying at university 
In my 4th year of a 3 year course
Doing my dissertation only
Have a part time job
Have a deadline next week (now extended to the following week)

Had work today, 
Can't do course work tonight

Had the toilet epiphany of 

I can't do uni work the same day as job work because it takes up all my 'energy' that I'd use to focus on my uni work

Leaving me with a productivity of 0 and stress of infinity

On the plus side I've browsed some dank memes and I'm fully up to date on all the tv shows I watch

Hope the layout helps  I found that getting up at 5am and just sitting with a HUGE mug of tea in front of a lappy kicked things off. If this is emergency time then you can use chunks of the entire 24 hrs but pomodoro if you can. Also some dissertation tasks need little focus or energy ie crank out that bibliography, label those diagrams and fix the foot/end notes when you are low on kryptonite. I will give this a go on a day off thank you, but also what is pomodoro? aah yesss menial tasks, i need to do the big work that leads to them smaller tasks first haha, i need a productive day sooooon 
 [Pomodoro](http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730) is a system for work rhythm.  It acts as a regular prompt to focus on the important stuff. In practice, the timer bit also makes sure that ADHD-me gets back to working. Are you a Certified pomodoro master?
