How do you configure your computer to be as non-distracting as possible? I just got a new laptop with Windows 10 installed. It's very pretty and that's nice but I need it for school so it needs to help me actually function and it's failing miserably.

Part of my frustration I'm sure is just that I'm coming from Windows 7, and the new interface is unfamiliar. I know that there are a lot of things I can tweak and others I'll simply become accustomed to with time, but right now my productivity is shot and I'm very annoyed— half at the computer for being distracting and half at myself for being so easily distracted.

What are some things you guys do/how do you set up your computer/tablet/phone to be as helpful to you as possible? Is there a list of resources for this problem somewhere? I can't seem to find anything, but I also can't think of a clear and short way to word it. Thank you! Here are my main issues for anyone interested/bored:
   
First: Whenever I turn this computer on Windows wants to update something. Above and beyond anything else, I need this machine to turn on and be able to start writing near instantly. But nooooooo.

My internet connection is very slow, so if I were given the option I would opt out of updates. Windows 10 doesn't seem to allow you to opt out of updates however, so I've just sat here for 45 minutes while my computer installed something. The only difference that I can see is that the distracting tiles seem a bit bigger and all the words in the Start menu have been replaced with little minimalist symbols. Oh joy.


Second: There are a bunch of brightly colored moving tiles that keep catching my eye. Again, they're pretty but I take one look at them and everything I was working on whooshes out of my mind.


 Third: There is a startling *ping* alert noise that I haven't figured out how to turn off that keeps interrupting my writing to prompt me to read, update, or install something, which brings me to— 


Forth: It keeps randomly updating and installing updates, changing settings and moving things around! 


I feel like I'm channeling someone's grandma when I say this, but this computer needs to stop doing things without me asking, because I bought it to write essays on and I've spent the last hour digging through settings trying to turn off all system updates.


Has anyone else dealt with this problem? I got a program called ColdTurkey. There is a paid and free version. I normally don't pay for programs and tend to opt for the free version, but for this one I was willing to bite the bullet. I got the bundle that came with ColdTurkey Writer Pro.

Basically, for ColdTurkey, you create a block list of websites and apps. My main block list is: Reddit, Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, and the Steam app. I set a block of time where I literally can't access these programs/sites from my PC and uninstalling the program is a real hassle. I set timers for it as needed. Something like two hours on with thirty minute breaks or whatever suits my needs for the day. You can set a schedule and make it so that you can't change what's blocked for a predetermined number of days. 

ColdTurkey Writer opens up a text editor and if I am remember correctly, you can't exit until you write for a certain number of minutes or a certain number of words (I haven't used this aspect of the program in a while so I can't remember how it works). I find it good for papers. I just turn on Spotify in the background and control it from my phone so I can get to writing. 

I used this for my midterms and while it isn't perfect I found that being willing to set a schedule and blocking the programs took away at least one distraction for me. I could use my PS4 or phone as a distraction as well, but if I am sitting at the computer with this I found it a lot easier to do work. I gave my PS4 to my boyfriend and told him not to give it back to me until after exam week. All this combined with my medication really helped me a lot. 

I really think it's worth paying for it's helped me a lot and fairly easy to use. https://getcoldturkey.com/


Edit: I hope this is helpful. After rereading your post/comment I'm not completely sure this is applicable to your situation. I just want to tell you that I can relate.  i switched to 10 a year ago, and I had 7 before that.  Before 7, I was using Vista, which was just the worst.  I was so happy when 7 came around.  Now, it feels like we have gone back to Vista.

I don't know how I deal with it, I suppose I just got used to wonky file-management system.  I keep my most frequently used apps on pinned to the bar.  It's been one year and sometimes I still get lost trying to find files I saved months ago. Remove all the shovelware tiles except maybe weather & calculator, and replace them with apps you use. If you don't have many, just ignore it. I share your rage for fresh windows installs having Minecraft and Candy Crush advertisements on the start menu, but at least they can be removed.

Any more I don't use the start button at all and just use the start bar at the bottom. Make sure your file explorer and browser are down there. When file explorer is already open you can right click it and click "file explorer" and it will open additional file explorers.

Note that you can drag any window to the right or left side of the screen to instantly half-screen it. Also note that you can always drag to and click the lower right extreme corner to return to the desktop.

You desktop should not have shortcuts on it at all (except the bin). Put only files you're working on actively on the desktop. If you don't have any, enjoy your new digital art frame. Whenever it starts to get cluttered, clean it out.

Actually use the system folders (pictures, documents) for their described purpose. You can move these to another location or hard drive if you google how to. By that I mean make sub-folders ("Tax Documents"), not "dump everything in."

If you have lots of games, add non-steam games to steam and quarantine them all there. Steam now does categories, so you can categorize that as well if you want to. Having over 500 games, I needed to separate the VR ones from the regular ones since those are two totally different activities. [This](http://imgur.com/Zb7VLME) is about the only method I've found that works.  use a pen and pad unless you *have* to use a computer.

by the time i sit down in front of that screen i know exactly what i need it to do for me... instead of allowing myself to serve its dull illumination until the wee hours clicking on random shit or optimizing or installing things or playing games.

use it as a tool. do you pick up a saw every single time you need a tool from the toolbox? no, you don't.

i have found some success with going back to a pen and paper. when i hit a wall with the capability of that tool i turn my computer on and use that as a tool as well.

when it's playtime do whatever you want, but when you're working... everything must be a tool or it is useless.

need to write something and have to type it because you don't have time to transcribe what you wrote in a notebook or on a legal pad? turn the wifi off. you don't need a tool with wifi. your computer is only a word processor if you only need a word processor.

am i making some sort of sense here? Chrome OS. There is little to no games for it, and it can't run .exe's so it's really hard to get distracted. Not sure how much you've played around with settings/googled how to change things, but I've included a few things that might help below.

* **First/Fourth:** If you have Windows 10 Professional, you can actually turn off automatic updates altogether. However, assuming you're using Windows 10 Home, you won't be able to completely turn them off. You can set them to update at specific times though. Another option, if you're using WiFi, is to set the connection to "metered." (This is generally reserved for connections with data limits so you don't go over your cap.) You can set Windows updates to only install on non-metered connections. [This link](http://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/) should explain how to do all of that. **Just as a note:** Windows updates, as annoying as the are, are actually really important. They help keep your computer safe. If you choose to turn them off in some way, make sure you schedule a time to manually check for updates every now and then. (Set an alarm on your phone or something - If you're anything like me, I know you'll forget!)
* **Second:** Are you talking about the shiny spinning tiles on the start menu? If you are, [you can right click on them and upin them from the start menu.](http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/small-windows-10-start-menu/) On my computer, I don't have any tiles turned on. I just pin my most-used programs to the task bar so I can easily grab them from there without having to even open the start menu.
* **Third:** [You can turn off notification pings.](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/turn-off-notification-system-sounds-windows-10) You can choose to either turn them all off *or* you can choose to only turn off certain notification sounds.

Hope this helps! Leave it running so it can auto update... Again, 7 sec. boot time in chrome OS when you boot and install an update at the same time No it's absolutely helpful, thank you! Once I figure out Windows 10 and mess with the settings a bit something along these lines would be *exactly* what I'd need, and it's what I was curious about anyway— I've been a bit unnerved at how easily I can be distracted, and was wondering if other people had problems along the same lines and it's oddly reassuring that you do.

Anyhoo. I just need to be able to write essays. That's it, it's just that I'm so distractable that anything colorful or loud or unexpected throws me off, and your suggestion looks super useful for later, so thank you for that. The stupid tiles! There's a news tile that kicks my brain off in whatever terrible or ridiculous direction the world happens to be turning in and it's just. Stop it, laptop. Just stop. I don't need the news and Evernote and Netflix and Xbox live and Skype and Twitter cheerily waving at me constantly. And it keeps updating and installing updates randomly! I don't suppose you've figured out how to turn updates off? Windows 10 has a number of seemingly redundant applications- they meant to make touchscreen friendly versions of all of them. Don't do what I did and obstinately try to remove the unnecessary new versions. They rely on the same back-end and you will break everything and have to reinstall windows, lol. Just ignore how silly it is and choose your preferences.

"That time I broke the calculator because I got annoyed that Windows' new image viewer wasn't as useful for porn." Not my high point. Arrrg, I feel like this UI was designed to be pretty first and productive second. 

Looking at my desktop I have the Recycle Bin, Google Chrome, three Kaspersky apps, Steam, Microsoft Word, Kindle, and four games as shortcuts. I'm not one of those people who saves and dumps everything to the desktop.

Interestingly, I'm not actually distracted at all by the games or superfluous apps, it's the *movement* that kills me. Movement and bright colors and alerts and that annoying alert *ping* sound— basically anything that could possibly be jarring or surprising I have absolutely no capacity to handle.

I actually have a pretty decent system going on that I've carried over since, let's see... 2005, wow. I have files from fifth grade deep down in the 'School Essays' subfolder. I've never lost anything, I don't think— I think this might actually be the one area of my life where I'm quite organized and on top of things.

Which makes this whole thing so much more annoying because it seems so much more difficult for no good reason. lol :)

maybe I'm paranoid, but that phrasing plus your username made me think you were a spambot at first. (I wasn't going to expand the link without checking) This.  In medical school I never took my laptop to lecture unless I had to.  Even when we had power point handouts and the words were right in front of me, I would still write down everything as if it wasn't there. 

It was a pain in the butt, but I'm so glad I did it that way.  The act of writing forced me to pay attention, and it served as a valuable study aid later when I had to go back and look things up. I had my personal notes to cross reference with the slides.  Oh thank you for getting rid of those pings! That's a godsend!

I have Home, of course, so I can't turn them off completely. I also, however, really *do* have a metered connection, which is the main reason I'm annoyed. My Internet is slow af, and all I want to do with it is occasionally turn in essays and Google. I'm not banking or paying bills, and I have Kaspersky installed, so while I understand that keeping Windows up to date is important it just seems like overkill to keep updating things for security reasons when all I want to do is open Word. No problem :) If you want to just write essays I would absolutely get the ColdTurkey Writer today, especially if you're in school and need to write for the end of the semester! It's nice to just have minimal interface. I can't play around as much with fonts and dumb distracting things like that, ya know? It's definitely worth it and I hope it helps you out. You can remove tiles from the start screen/menu, there's an option when you right-click them. On My Windows 10 machine, I have 1 tile that I actually use as a tile - a clock. All my other "tiles" are really just shortcuts to my most-used apps, and grouped by vague category.

With a new device, you'll get a bunch of updates at first, but once the device is up to date, you'll get them less often. You *should not* turn updates off. Computers with out-of-date versions of software are more vulnerable to viruses and other malware. Microsoft recognize this as the serious problem that it is, and you actually *cannot* disable updates to Windows itself, though individual programs can have updates disabled.

What you *should* do is uninstall all the programs you don't use which came with the laptop. The bloatware, typically installed by PC vendors to try to squeeze extra money out of their customers, is useless for most users, and a needless distraction for those of us with ADHD. Unfortunately, I do not think the updates can be bypassed...  But sometimes they can be delayed...  I have not shut my laptop down for like 3 days because I have no time for updates, LOL! If you've just had enough and want to go back to a  more familiar design, try installing http://www.classicshell.net/. I have tried installing and uninstalling it and it goes away clean no problem. It just reskins your desktop to look basically exactly like Windows 7. This one weird trick stops Mark Wahlberg procrastinating! Psychiatrists hate him!!

I've been accused of being a spam bot before for my username =( but I promise I'm real. Bots are more organised. We had professors make their lectures "engaging" and interactive" by leaving gaps/blanks/paragraphs in the slides to be filled in. So you had to print 400+ slides per course per semester. And then everyone sat there just waiting to write down the words, bored shitless, and talking loudly because it's all there on the slides and they only need to add a word. And the professors were pissed nobody was paying attention. No kidding. 

Man I hated those lectures. They're the worst. And I tried to keep my notes, write the lectures down neatly, and always failed because they rushed through their incomplete slides. 

Uni just isn't for the ADHD sufferer. :( Ugh. I hated professors who did that. The worst was if you missed a lecture, the notes were useless.
