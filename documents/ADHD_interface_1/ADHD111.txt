Trying to start a support group at my university. Suggestions flyer. So I'm trying to start an ADHD support group at my university and suggestions for a potential flyer would be greatly appreciated, especially anything related to font color.  

The layout I thought of so far:  

_________________________________________________________________________________________  
ADHD Support Group *(in as large a font size as possible)*  
    Contact information: E-mail address  
__  
As you are reading this I assume that you would be interested in a support group for people with ADHD. I am sad to say that there is no such group as of yet and this is just a way to find potential members.  
If you are indeed interested or know anyone who might be, please spread the message or send an e-mail to the indicated address.

*Space to tear off contact information*  
_________________________________________________________________________________________   looks great. i would also set up a facebook page. a lot of people feel more comfortable checking something out online before sending an email or showing up to a meeting. :) wish someone would do this in my city! Hmm, yes. However there's not much more information I could put on a FB page, as the support group doesn't exist yet. Maybe a FB group (which can be hidden from the public), as we need a place to discuss anyway...  
Moreover I don't want to make anything too public, I mean if you like a FB page, all of your friends are able it. yes, that's true. maybe when you have some members, setting up a private group on facebook would be better.
