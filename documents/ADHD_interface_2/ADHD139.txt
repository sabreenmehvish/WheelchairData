ADD and reading i have ADD and for what ever reason i can’t stand reading. it’s not necessarily that the book is boring or i’m uninterested, it’s that i usually loose focus or think about other things while i’m reading and go off on a tangent in my head and then realize i have no idea wtf just happened on the last two pages. this is extremely frustrating as I’m finishing up summer reading (i’m in HS). For one book i did the audio version which was great, but i’m actual reading this last one and and it takes me so long to just read a little bit. Is this normal? what should I do?  Feel your pain. If I don’t finish a book in a day, it’s gonna take weeks or months. Super frustrating when you think you’ve read a paragraph or a page  and then you maybe think about it and all of a sudden, you have no idea what’s happened the last 5 minutes, no information was retained and you have to go back to understand it. Sometimes 2-3 times. The part I hate the most, is then a particular word or sentence makes you think of something else and all of a sudden you’ve spent 10 minutes day dreaming of something else lol. Super frustrating. 

Sometimes I have more success if I narrate the book in my head with the accent of the author or who the book is about. Helps keep focus a little bit more “sometimes”.  I'm dealing with this now.. I'm reading Gone Girl for pleasure. I used to read all the time when I was younger but now, no matter how badly I think I want to read, my focus just wanders all over the place. I'm about to start a program that I MUST get As in and I'm terrified that I won't be able to concentrate/retain the material! This is absolutely normal if reading is not a thing that causes your hyperfocus superpower to engage.

My neurotypical partner prefers audiobooks too, and they prefer video learning to both :-) Sounds normal to me, or at least sounds like my experience. Do you have any sort of IEP thing? Accommodations as well as discussing my difficulties with my teachers was helpful for me when I was in high school.  I don’t think I’ve read a full book in about a year, thing is though I really do want to read it I just can’t make myself pick it and open it. I got a book from the school library for over the summer, I forced my self to read the first chapter to see if I’d enjoy it. I did, so that day I read like 3 chapters, I was really into it thinking I’ll read it all by Friday, well I haven’t picked it up for 3 weeks. I want to but my brain just doesn’t so I don’t 😂
