ADHD and extended phone use? Hey all,  I just recently got clinically diagnosed and have started treatment for ADHD and after browsing this sub I realized that potentially a lot of my behaviors are explained by adhd. Anyway to keep it short( I know a lot are about to be done reading by now ) do you guys notice prolonged phone use? I use mine a lot and can’t tell if it’s something about myself or more due to my adhd. It's 2018. Everyone is glued to their phone. Probably both. Do you mean *playing* on your phone or *talking* on your phone?  I hate talking on the phone, and that has stood since I was a wee thing growing up and first allowed to use the landline.  So obviously that has nothing to do with work/obligations.  Since it was a landline, and not even cordless, I was kind of tethered, and could not stand to just sit there talking to someone I was just going to see at school the next day anyway.  Thus began decades of avoiding all communications technology and damaging relationships, which *is* an ADHD thing. Oh well that is interesting but I did mean more playing/ using my phone
