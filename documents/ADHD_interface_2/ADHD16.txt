Difficulty in rembering names of characters while reading. I wanted to know if any one else had the same issue in remembering names while reading . Fiction or non fiction ,, even character or places . As soon as more than one characters start speaking I just can not follow the line of thought. It is a shame because I like reading and I constantly get fucked up due to this .  I'm the same way but it doesn't just stop at reading. Video games and television too. I'll start to binge watch a tv show with friends and after 3 episodes, they will be like, "I really like the dynamic between such and such. Woopty woop is my favorite character." I usually just nod and chuckle in agreement but low-key have no f'n clue who they are talking about. It always takes me 5 times longer for characters to sink in and register with me. 


 The Game of Thrones series was a nightmare to get through I'll be reading a book and suddenly it will be talking about Sally. I'm like who the f is Sally. Turn the pages back and find shes been been a main character for the past 2 chapters and I never even realised what I was reading I can count at least 10 people who I consider personal friends that I do not know their names.  I have to ask other, closer, supportive friends who they are every time I see them.

So yeah, I forget names in books a lot too... Kindle X-ray helps  Shiiiit im the same way. Im surprised i know anyones name at work, I've only been here 3 years. We recently pulled up some documents for review and in the meeting the manager says i made these docs and i was impressed. Im like, I actually made these? When did i do that? Lol. It was literally around feb/march of this year. Damn I wish I had the ability to binge watch!! Yes ... Yes... Who the fuck is Sally now ? This is the question with its many permutations that I ask myself everytime a Sally or James or someone else just pops up.  Find a show you love and let the hyper focus ensue!
