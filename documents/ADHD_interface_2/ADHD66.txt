How can I reduce technology use? I'm really really trying to stop thinking about my phone. It's not like im tech-addicted, it's more like an antsy tendency and **inability to focus on one thing**. I'd LOVE to be one of those people who studies for an hour and "totally forgot to check their phone". Instead, **I'm checking it every 5 minutes as i study.** It's almost like a **nervous tic** since I'm often not expecting anything. I feel like I always want a conversation to be going or for there to be something entertaining. I'm in medical school and have exams in about a week and recently deleted Instagram because I would always pick it up and mindlessly scroll. Now, I feel like I'm always eager to have a text convo going on. **I want to just not be thinking about my computer/talking to others in general** (also, yes, I have a mac with iMessage and all my work is done on there). I never have any notifications on and it's on silent, but I still have **no self control** when it comes to picking up my phone and checking. This may seem silly and like an easy fix, but I hope some of you have some sympathy and can give me tips on how to learn to get some distance and not need to multitask. Side note: if any of you can relate, I also have anxiety and OCD which exacerbates some of this.  Have you checked out the app called Flipd?? That’s a pretty cool one. Makes all the social media/other distracting apps on your phone temporarily disappear for a set amount of time. Does have some downsides though. 

Every once in a while apps may not come back. If they do, they’re not usually in the order you had them. You have to pay for premium if you wanna get a lot of the cooler things. 

There’s at least one big red flag too: if you use Full Lock Mode, a manager working for the app developer is given access to your phone including apps, personal info etc. 

*HOWEVER* 

The new iOS 12 update includes this thing called Screen Time which is in your Settings and does pretty much all the same stuff *for free*.  Ugh, I'm the opposite off meds. I completely ignore messages for hours to the point where my boss needs to call me asking if I'm working. I'd gladly give you some of mine if you give me some of your :p
