I just started reading “Women With Attention Deficit Disorder: Embrace Your Differences and Transform Your Life”. I highly suggest reading if you are a woman or a partner of a woman with ADHD. Of course in perfect ADHD form I couldn’t sleep, purchased this book, and read for two hours. This quote really hit home and I think is helping me unravel some of the shame and guilt I have felt over my whole life:

“Women with AD/HD often live in a secret world. Some people call it passing for normal. I call it being locked in a (messy) closet. Whatever the cute expressions, the painful reality is that many women with AD/HD have moved away from relationships or have at least kept a part of themselves locked away from other people, usually without even realizing it. 

Often their lives have taken on a secret tone, as if the way they live is in some way shameful. This feeling of secrecy and shame wipes out the possibility of enjoying or appreciating all their other abilities and qualities. Their inner world is a place that outsiders couldn’t fathom, where the simplest activities—getting dressed, planning the day, or running a simple errand—are extremely difficult and frustrating. 

The cumulative effect of these daily experiences makes them feel like outsiders, separate from the world in some important way, spending their days
coping with this silent thief of time and dreams instead of living life.”

There are stories of women with ADHD in the book that are just heartbreaking. Years of being misunderstood, being thought too stupid for school, too lazy for motherhood or managing a household, too unmotivated to follow their dreams, being treated for depression, being told they just have “unresolved feelings” and that’s why they struggle. Or living a seemingly normal, successful life, but keeping people at a distance and hiding the chaos and how much time they spend catching up just to get by.

The book is written for a female audience but I’m positive the emotions and experiences are things men with ADHD experience as well. And it gives such a great perspective of how ADHD often manifests in girls as children and adults.

Anyway time to nod off for a few and then try to enjoy my vacation!! Happy weekend to all.  Thanks! I'm always looking for literature specifically on women with adhd as lots of people don't seem to think we exist. I've been turned away by a doctor who thought i was 'crying to get attention'. If you haven't seen The Sound of Music, I would recommend it to every woman with ADHD. Honestly the best accidental portrayal of ADHD ever. It's not a movie about her getting her shit together and becoming a good nun, I'll tell you that much. They couldn't make a better movie about having ADHD today if they TRIED

How do you solve a problem like Maria? Get that lady some Vyvanse geez It’s “funny,” I have been diagnosed with ADHD, but also have suffered so much trauma, it’s like my therapist doesn’t know where to start. The bit you mentioned about unresolved feelings kind of nails it for me. Yes, I’ve been through a lot of trauma. Yes, I probably have PTSD. But THAT is NOT what has made me feel like a waste of space my entire life. THAT was probably DUE to compulsive behavior BECAUSE OF adhd. It’s a tricky world to live with both. Anyway, great post and I can’t wait to read this book!  Holy snap. That quote. It made me tear up slightly. I am going to buy the book now. Thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to look into this book.

This all is why I don't leave the house. I don't leave my messy, cluttered house. Ha...haha...ha. Omg all the feels, all of this! Thank you for this recommendation, definitely seeing if there’s an audible version too!

edit: there is and audible version! 
Yay for completely spacing on my audible credit, thanks past me! It's available on hoopla!!! Yay library!! Ugh stab me in the heart with such an accurate quote, why don't ya? 


I'm kidding. Thank you for the recommendation. I didn't think there'd be books out there for lADHDies It would be a blessing to the world if more men committed themselves to studying and understanding the female experience in all aspects of life, including here in our little family of uniquely different brains.

 Found it on eBay for $4, can’t wait to read it! My partner is super patient and tries to understand and I’m always looking for resources to help. Thanks for recommending! I have also recently started reading this book!!! It was recommended here a while ago and thought I would check it out, and it's amazing! 

It's a good book to learn about ADHD in women, specifically inattentive type, but also holds a lot of useful information for men with ADHD as well (as you mentioned). I've been reading it with my partner to help him understand ADHD better. 

I also really love how the book is layed out. It isn't overwhelming, and the chapters are split in a way that you can easily come back to sections. The author herself has ADHD, which I think made this book even better since she was able to truly understand what it is like to have it. You can see not only how she has grown and learned how to live with her adhd, but also how many other women have gone through their life with it as well. It feels like a weight has been lifted to read about how there are others that are going through/have gone through similar feelings with ADHD. Like in the book, a lot of women tend to keep to themselves thinking they are failures, wondering what is wrong with them, when in reality nothing is wrong. Yea, our brains work differently than a neurotypical brain but that doesn't make us failures. ADHD brains are just as amazing. 

Definitely a must-read! All I can say to that quote is SOOO TRUE!!! I must get this book and read it!! I love this book. I have so many post it notes and scribbles in this book. TBH, I think it’s probably a valuable book for men as well, even though some of it is specific to the culture women grow up in and the societal and familial expectations in us. 

Hell the book helped me understand why I was so often not social, retreated when friends were going out (too much to do to hang out) but also to not ignore the social aspects of my life because I thought they were unimportant or fun. Because you still need that to be happy. 

  This quote makes a lot of sense of my life before I started medication.  Almost all of it was drenched in shame. And I didn't even realize it, because the feeling was so omnipresent that I didn't realize that it wasn't normal and that it was a feeling and not a character trait. Plus, I was so ashamed of feeling ashamed that I couldn't even acknowledge that this feeling even existed in my life.  

Man, this was bad... Life is still hard, but so much easier and manageable than it was before I started to regularly taking methylphenidate... Whenever I failed at simple, mundane tasks, this voice in my head would start to scream at me like "What the f... is wrong with you?". Now these moments have become so seldom that the voice will usually just be like "Oh, did you forget to take your meds today? Or are you just hungry?  Haven't slept enough? No problem man, you're only human, just take a break and relax a little. no need to feel bad about yourself and your abilities..."  There's a smaller sub, r/adhdwomen , you could xpost to =oD That quote is just a little bit too close to home. Damn. Does anyone else find a really long post in an ADHD subreddit kinda ironic? I couldn’t get past the second sentence  Thank you for posting about this! The quote you shared and some of the things you said really ring true for me, and I just now went on overdrive and borrowed the audiobook from my library.  thank you!

&#x200B; I can't thank you enough for sharing this. I'm on Chapter 8 of the audiobook and everything is really hitting home. As someone who secretly worked both days this weekend just to catch up... :(

It's at the point where I just assume ahead of time that I'm screwing up or failing. The first word out of my mouth is usually 'sorry' in every conversation Is this the one where she says hire a maid and order out food all the time? I can't remember the title but I read something similar if not this book and I found it to be pretty condescending, presumptuous, classist, and even pretty sexist. I'm sorry if I'm giving a critique of a book that's not this one but it's been on my mind ever since I read it (and discarded it). I'll have to look this up, thanks for sharing! Thank you. I just got a copy and am feeling emotional  just reading the forward; I'm excited to read the rest of it. I have often thought about looking to books about this, but always forget (weird!) I will definitely read this book so thanks for posting.  Just out of curiosity, have you seen or heard of any books regarding a persons diet and ADD? Or more specifically I book with a diet plan or foods that help improve (not sure what word to use so I wrote improve but, you know what I mean, right?) ADD or some of the symptoms? I’m 40 and I’ve been on Adderall for 12 years. I’ve maxed out in the dose and my doctor has no plans to adjust anything. (I’ve taken Wellbutrin for 17 years as well for depression ) so I’m trying to figure out what I can do to help myself because I swear my ADD gets worse every year and at my age it’s almost crippling at times :( 
Any info is sincerely appreciated.  I just started reading this today! It has been so helpful so far, I haven't been able to put it down. I don't think I've ever read a book so quickly before. She has an uncanny way of describing my life perfectly.  Wow I needed to read that and will definitely be buying the book.  Lady here. Just wanted to say thank you. I had such a hard time cleaning in the beginning of my marriage and my husband hates it. Which, we’ve worked it out and we have a great routine. 
But for years I periodically felt intense shame because my in laws told me once that I need to spend more time cleaning or my kids were going to be taken away. They were acting like I left diapers around when I didn’t. My problem was just piles of dishes and laundry to fold. I hate folding laundry most. 

Annnyway, I have a routine now and I also remind myself I have a life every time I notice a building pile. Hubs and I spend a quick 5-15 minutes every night running all our messes to their spaces. Husband folds all the laundry now.

It’s better now. The shame is gone, but sometimes I remember it and it makes me feel just like I’ll never measure up to their ‘perfect’. HOLY FUCK THEY ARE IN MY BRAIN! 😳😳 Now I think I’m scared to read this book. Please tell me there are some solutions? Some ideas to stay present in life and enjoy the moments.   Thanks! I will check it out. I got diagnosed at age 30, and looking back I did really well in school (yay structure), despite being lost in a fantasy world for most of my classes. Post-school life was a huge struggle, and even though I have been very successful as an entrepreneur, I still feel like a total failure and mess most days. I have so much shame! Working on it with therapy and reading Brene Brown and Tara Brach, but should definitely pick up this too as it is geared to my specific problem.  Shit that quote resonates so much Just bought it on Amazon; thank you! Though it’s currently out of stock so it sounds like word is getting around already haha Commenting so I can order later.  Relating so hard it hurts. Lol I always try to consider my audience here but sometimes I get carried away :P The captain was always my favorite character in the Tintin books my mom read to me in French as a kid. Who knew I’d take the character so much to heart; Sea Captain and raging alcoholic was my jam for 15 years. :-/ I’m not a woman nor am I currently dating a woman with adhd.   Would you still recommend it?  

Edit: why did I get downvoted so much lmao. Was legit asking I’d say everything in this post applies to just anyone with adhd There is a study I read somewhere that women are taken less seriously by doctors (male and female) than men. The theory is that since men are less likely to go to the doctor, that when they go in they must be serious. It's sad that gender stereotypes affect the medical industry as well.  Jfc.  Sounds like they had a few too many teeth I've been accused of drug-seeking when asking about a refill for vyvanse! I'm still not being treated for my ADHD. It's great being a woman with ADHD isn't it?  Honorable mention to Anne of Green Gables and Lorelai in Gilmore Girls. Not sure I've ever related to two characters more! Whoa... I never totally realized this, but YES, I totally see it now! Her ADHD saved that whole family from the freaking Nazis (and it's lovely that this is a true story, and they now have a sweet little resort in Stowe, Vermont). Go ADHD, am I right?? Seriously made me laugh out loud. Thank you. And so true!
 I’ve never seen the movie. Probably never will, but I know of it. Can you explain what you mean? Oh interesting! I have never seen that movie, I'll have to watch it.  Wow, I never thought of it that way but you are hella right! Also a great example of how finding the right work environment can help minimize the most dysfunctional aspects of ADHD. Oh my gawd this has been my favorite movie forever and I have never realised why! Thank you for this!  🤣 “I have been diagnosed with ADHD, but also have suffered so much trauma, it’s like my therapist doesn’t know where to start.”

^Literally me Oh snap! I should have checked there before buying it! Yes :) Billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles! Omg! I never knew this existed. Awesome!! The only solution is to force yourself. Sometimes we have to do boring things if we want to acquire information. Yup. And a personal assistant. I personally loved her advice- my take away was “these are the things you are going to struggle with, they’re a bigger drain on your time and mental faculties than they are for neurotypical people, and because you’re a woman socialized to believe that these things are part of your self worth, your failures to perform them is going to keep frustrating you. So instead of killing your self doing “adulting” right, hire people do those things for you, and put your time and energy into what you are good at.” Hmm nothing that I’ve read so far matches that, although I haven’t finished it. I hope not! That’s bad advice :(  Keto is pretty interesting. Watch “The Magic Pill” on Netflix (I think that’s what it’s called?). Anyway, not sure if it’s been linked or studied in association to ADHD, but the documentary looks at cases of those with different issues, cancer, etc. The one that really spoke to me was the autistic kid - non functioning for years, and within 6 months he was able to feed himself and have conversations with his caregivers. 

Anyway, my husband and I tried it, and even though we ultimately couldn’t stick to it 100%, we’ve gotten a lot better on eating clean, less processed foods, more natural sugars, and try to limit carbs to only smaller amounts of complex carbs. It’s made a huge difference in how we feel, and by not being super strict it doesn’t feel as confining. 

I will say, that first time we really tried 100% Keto, that first month of no sugar or carbs was fucking torture. You don’t realize how addicted your body is until you cut it out. We finally figured out that we could use bacon as chips and eat it with everything from guac to bruschetta. So much bacon. Everyone kept saying how fattening it is, but people don’t realize that your brain needs fats to function, and it was still healthier than everything we were eating before.  The Whole30 diet claims to have positive effects on ADHD symptoms, and I’ve definitely found that to be true, but mileage may vary! 

What specifically are you struggling with? I’m a bit younger than you, but I’m also on Wellbutrin and Vyvanse, and it took adding another antidepressant (Remeron) to really make a difference in my impulse control and emotional regulation.  I think it’s valuable, especially if you have inattentive ADHD. It talks a lot about the emotional impact of ADHD - the guilt, and the shame of being told you aren’t good enough. I think that’s worth reading - although it does focus entirely on women’s experiences with ADHD.  Because of traditional female gender roles (which are still in place, no matter what people say), women do experience ADHD differently.  We are less likely to be diagnosed, we are shamed much more for our messiness because it's our "job" to keep house, juggle appointments for the entire family, keep up with everyone's clothing and belongings.  Obviously not every family is set up this way, but this is still how most people are raised, and how most hetero couples exist in the home.  

So yes, gender is important to this discussion. Yes, this. Historically, medicine has focused on men’s issues. Men are studied more and used as the standard, so when a woman comes in with a different set of symptoms, she often gets misdiagnosed. It’s only been more recently that they’re realizing that many diagnoses manifest differently in women and require a different treatment course.  This is the worst thing I've ever dealt with. My husband is a total hypochondriac who refuses to take care of his known conditions or make healthy choices .... but I avoid going to the doctor as much as possible. I am very proactive about changing my life around to solve problems or have a complete understanding of factors that could make me sick, so if I see a doctor, I have as much information as possible.

But if I ever say there's something wrong, he immediately gets annoyed. He assumes that I'm hysterical almost immediately. And then, most doctors act exactly the same way as he does. Exactly.

Like, my dad was a doctor, and I know they can be assholes, but I also know what is worth seeking help for, and what I can do to have more information for them to help them assess what's up.

But, my husband going to the doctor every month for tummy aches because he's lactose intolerant, known for 20 years but still eats dairy: totally legit concern.

Me, fetal position, passing out in an cold bath because of pain: annoyance, eye rolls, grumbles, glaring at me while I try to explain as calmly as I can while he.....

Oh shit, I just remembered that I married an absolute asshole. Adhd dismissal is absolutely valid, but I'm conflating the doctors with my husband, who is awful sometimes.  Yeah, in all areas of health. We’re often considered to be weaker or more sensitive, even subconsciously. Like, if you asked these doctors if they thought this way, they’d probably say “of course not,” but social conditioning is strong. 

This is usually the reason that things like PCOS and endo are brushed aside when we go to doctors with symptoms; “it’s just cramps, take some ibuprofen/use a heating pad.” 

ADHD is famously a “boy’s” disorder, so it’s even harder to get taken seriously with it. 

It’s why I almost exclusively see female doctors. They have a bias too, but often take me more seriously. It’s also part of why I’m hesitant to switch psychiatrists, because even though her receptionists are absolute dingbats and she seems kinda sketchy herself, she takes my ADHD seriously...  Yup. There was a meta analysis done some time ago (iirc, 2011?!) where they looked at all the studies on gender in health care settings, and they looked at how much worse woman’s outcomes were primarily because they were treated as tho there complaints were less serious. This ranged from worse emergent care (assuming anxiety as opposed to a heart attack, so they were triaged as less important more often and has longer times to diagnose heart attacks in emergency rooms) to worse pain management, to more assumptions of mental health issues rather than physical ailments. Cancer was often detected later, etc... I wish I could find the study, because if iirc it was funded by the AMA, or the AMA promoted it as pretty damning and pointed to a need that medical care needed to change. I would love to print and keep handy whenever I’m dealing with doctors. I’m sure it wouldn’t help in the moment, but also the bridge has usually already been burned at that point.

I myself was passed from doctor to doctor to doctor to doctor when trying to figure out some health issues. I was misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia even though I didn’t fit all the criteria for it. It was a junk diagnosis* because I was a woman with chronic pain. Eventually, while trying to get a nerve block to relieve the symptoms, a fresh faced PA recognized my pain as the classic pain pattern from a thoracic herniation. Every other specialist overlooked it. It’s not common, but also I don’t think I would have been thrown in a diagnostic pile to be ignored.

I am now struggling with an issue related to my hands and wrists. I’m having a miserable time being dismissed by doctors. In part because of the fibromyalgia diagnosis. The incorrect fibromyalgia diagnosis. I’ve had some hand specialist suggest it’s an emotional issue. Never mind the fact that I have worked in computers for 20+ years. I do not see a man being told that the hand pain from their 20+ years in software development is an emotional issue. Call me crazy.

 I can definitely see that. Even doctors have their own bias and unfortunately the world tends to take women less seriously. Which really annoys me, because despite self-identifying as non-binary, I was born and present female. I'm often been told I have a "male" personality by teachers, counselors, etc. I'm more likely to borrow my feeling or get mad than sad, I don't like asking for directions, I'm not very intuitive with feelings or "reading" people, good at math/bad at literature, etc, but I still get that biased shit from doctors. I think they think women are just complainers, because when I do come in with a complaint and it turns out to actually be something (for example, ankle pain that turned out to be 2 healed fractures and a new fragmented bone) they are so surprised... My coworker told me that she had recently seen a study that stated that men are more likely to be prescribed medication (not just for ADHD) than women. I would have liked to read it to see the reason for the difference, but just wanted to support what you said.  I have had to switch psychiatrists/therapists so many times for this reason  This is just the way the human brain works - there'll always be some form of unconscious bias at work but its all very very complex. 

On a counter note though, ADHD-Pi, and guys with ADHD-pi experience similar issues to woman in terms of diagnoses and isnt ADHD-pi the most common form of adhd for women?

Maybe its an adhd-pi thing? Or both?  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30653955-doing-harm

I've been wanting to read this book about that very subject, but I have a lot of books to read and I think it's just going to make me VERY ANGRY! Unfortunately I was too upset to rectify that for him. Next time. That's terrible. How can we look after our mental health if people won't even believe us when we say there's a problem? Imagine that... these have been favorites forever. Anne with an E on Netflix is a great adaptation of the books.  On a slightly related note, how perfect was becoming the mom to 8 children for a girl/woman like Maria?!? And Lorelei was my spirit animal!  That was one show I never missed and when the revival was coming I rewatched the entire series. Oye with the poodles already!

Edited because I submitted before I finished my thought... again... Interesting! I second that! Another honourable mention goes to Ayumu Kasuga (aka Osaka) from Azumanga Daioh. She's a good example of ADHD-PI, if a tad excessive on the daydreams. She's someone I've related to ever since I first saw the show 12 years ago. Yay for neurodiverisity!!

Although I have heard that the true story and real life Maria isn't as sweet as the movie version, but that's kinda how movies go. And life, more or less. But man, what a great movie! Her character is a pretty accurate representation of ADHD. 

Here's the lyrics to the a song about the other nuns complaining about her lateness, her being easily distracted, her distracting the others, and their difficulties in reining her in. [Half of them say she's a problem, one says she's vibrant, they muse over how to "solve a problem  like Maria" and the head nun insists it doesn't matter, she's still a person.](http://www.metrolyrics.com/maria-the-nuns-lyrics-the-sound-of-music.html) and here's a link to the [video](https://youtu.be/oku308DjiFo) them singing it. Bonus points: Maria is running late and interrupts them while they are singing about her

The plot of the movie involves her being sent by the nun on a mission to be basically a nanny for seven children. Their father is a widow and a captain in the army and he needs a governess for his troublemaker kids that have chased off every other governess. The kids themselves are emotionally stunted by being raised like they live in the army. It's a coming of age film for the children AND Maria who finds the challenge of bonding with the kids and having the energy to give them all the attention they need pushes her to thrive. Seeing his children thrive, the captain falls in love with her and also opens up. All the while, Nazi Germany is invading Austria. The eldest daughter is in love with a boy in the SS. They use music to escape Nazis. Maria gives up on being a nun. It's a long movie but a classic, arguably Julie Andrew's greatest performance, a classic. The songs are great and the writing is deeper than anyone could have ever accomplished with the idea "let's write a movie about ADHD"

 Probably never will? You are really denying yourself a cinematic treat. "[How do you solve a problem like Maria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYvyh3IIdDk)"  
She's a [sass queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJTRZI2HThU). Me too. Each session unearths a new thing we have to work on. The list is unbearably long now.  I read a different book with a similar suggestion, and I also felt it was pretentious to assume most people (especially adhd brains) can afford to pay for delegating chores. 

I still want to read it, but I was a little disappointed in hearing that was one of her suggestions. Obviously it would work, but it’s not really an option for the majority. 
 That's an extremely healthy re-framing!!! Kudos. 🌹 I think it's great advice, I'd love to hire out all that shit i can't remember to do, or the cooking that takes me 3x as long as it's supposed to.... Yea, Impulse control is a big one. I have no filter and say the most inappropriate things sometimes, not like sexual stuff but telling people off especially if I find out they talk about me behind my back, or if we get into a confrontation face to face. Be it at work, with friends, at my sons sports practices/games. It’s embarrassing, I just say the first thing that comes to mind and at first I think to myself, at least I’m not fake and tell it like it is but as time goes on I think of a million better way I could’ve said what I was trying to say and not come off like an ignorant asshole, which probably did initially. 
I know part of that is my age and personality, I don’t mind the speak my mind part but I wish I’d at least try to run it by myself real quick to minimize the insensitivity and abrasiveness that I can unleash.
The biggest one is time management, not sure if any diet or medicine in the world can help me there but a little help would be nice. I honestly mean no disrespect to anyone when I’m late but it’s gotten me into a lot of trouble both personally and professionally. Another big one for me is forgetting things. It could be forgetting where I put my keys, important papers or even what I was about to say. You name it I do it, I’m like a poster child for adult ADD. Careless mistakes, missing appointments, not being able to concentrate, procrastination etc. I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 23 and I swear it’s just getting worse as I age. Of course that makes me feel wicked stupid, like I’m some ditzy dumbass who comes across as incompetent or bitchy. Sometimes I have days where I feel great but typically my insecurities get the best of me. I just want to feel like a responsible adult. I know I’ll always have my quirks but I would love to show them a lot less!!  

Sorry for the Novel! Btw
Edit: I too am on another anti-depressant. Celexa 40mg as well as Levothyroxine 175 mcg for hypothyroidism.  Sounds very interesting!  I have inattentive adhd and have really been struggling lately with the whole idea of not being good enough.  

I will say, sometimes I wish a girl with adhd would come into my life so that I could be understood by someone. But then I think well shoot there’s a chance nothing would get done haha I still see all of those problems accounting towards men. We should stop segregating these problems because it takes away from informing the other side. And if gender is important, where is the discussion for men? [deleted] My ex was like that. When I went into labor with our second child all he did was get super irritated at me for his sleep being disturbed. Asshole. He’s still like that with our daughters.  Wow... I'm so sorry you have to deal with that. Your husband does sound like an asshole. What happens when you try to talk about these things? Apparently in my city there has been a huge influx of women being diagnosed with ADHD which I'm glad to hear. I just wish we had a club or something though so we could talk about the shit we deal with (reddit is awesome, but I'm so lonely and I wish I had people to talk to in person) Holy crap that’s just negligent practice on your doctor’s part. Wow. I have seriously spent like 30 minutes looking for that study you talked about but so far I have not found anything mentioning anything like what you said. 

but I did find that;
> Females receive more prescriptions for prescription painkillers like Vicodin, Percocet, and OxyContin, possibly because they are more likely to experience physical conditions causing chronic pain, such as endometriosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

[Source](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/drug-addiction/study-between-genders/)

But interestingly enough according to a relativity recent (2017) research survey from Sweden detailing reports of medication use and depression they found that;

> Men report depression to a greater extent than women but are prescribed ADs(Antidepressants)  to a lesser extent, possibly a sign of under-treatment. Women are prescribed ADs without reporting depression more often than men, possibly a sign of over-treatment. Although the causes remain unclear, diagnostic and treatment guidelines should benefit from considering gender differences in these respects.

[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451647/)

I did find a study done in 1992 that says the opposite what you prefaced here but the age maybe makes the results a little to dated.

Title;
> The influence of patient and physician gender on prescription of psychotropic drugs.

Abstract;

>There is a wealth of evidence that more psychotropic drugs are prescribed to female than to male patients. We studied the psychotropic drug prescription of 15 male and 9 female physicians to 2493 patients in the Ambulatory Care Clinic of a University hospital. The relative odds (RO) of benzodiazepine prescription to a female compared to a male patient was the same when the physician was a male or a female (adjusted RO: 1.8; 95% CL: 1.5-2.1). But female patients were significantly more likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs of all types from a female than from a male physician (adjusted RO: 1.3; 95% CL: 1.0-1.7). Information on patient diagnosis or on severity of symptoms would be needed to determine whether the present results reflect gender differences in medical care needs, overprescription of psychotropic drugs to females or underprescription of psychotropic drugs to males.

 So from what I have read, boys display the classic hyperactivity. Girls are generally either chatty, excitable, “silly”, or dreamy, spacy, quiet. Once we become adults, both genders appear to internalize their “hyperactivity”. We have restless thoughts, brains that don’t shut off, we fidget, shake our legs, etc. 

I would think that boys who have ADHD but are primarily inattentive would also not be diagnosed until much later - similar to there being girls who are classically hyperactive and get diagnosed.  Loving Anne with an E! True, but as a woman with adhd, I am not that sweet either, haha. Can't help the impulsiveness of my tongue when things are annoying, especially when I'm not medicated! Wow, thank you so much for the detailed description! I see what you mean.  That is for reminding me why I love this movie.  You are a national treasure I heard that complaint when I read it. Hell, it may have been what turned me on to it. But I liken it to when I had a house cleaner. I was convinced before I hired a house cleaner, I couldn’t afford it. But then for the sake of marital harmony, finally figured out a way to make it work.  And realized that it was a cost I could bear if I changed my lifestyle a little bit. 

I think this happens more often than we realize, especially those of us with adhd. Because we’re so overwhelmed and usually haven’t done so well with money either via career path, impulsivity or other, we clench on to the money we have. It ends up giving us scarcity mentality where we are afraid to give up money we don’t have to. 

Now, suggest we give up money for something that “should” be “easy” and it seems impossible and therefore pretentious. But our brains lie about the easy part. And because we’re bad at this money/time management thing, we never really get out of the hole that would let us earn more because we’re stuck failing at the “easy” stuff.

At least that’s how I’ve viewed it. I just wonder if it’s like the people that opine not being able to afford kids, then make it work when they do have them.  If I could afford it I would get take out or get a maid lol!  I know exactly what you mean on so much of that! I’ve struggled so much to learn stuff that it seems like everyone else just knows. Honestly, medication is one part of treatment, and if your doctor isn’t willing to review that and consider alternatives if it’s not working I would find a new one! But the other part is building skills. Have you looked into therapy at all? That can be really helpful for learning impulse control and coming up with strategies for time management etc. There are a lot of resources online as well if therapy isn’t available to you or not something you want to do!  I totally think if you have inattentive adhd it applies, from some of the comments in here from men with the same diagnosis it causes the exact same feelings of shame because it is usually not diagnosed in childhood.

And yeah lol, I was married to a guy with ADHD and we started using paper plates because we would never do dishes @_@  All those problems accounting towards men? No. When men have a messy house, they're just "typical men". Women are judged more harshly and looked down upon for the same thing.

Men are more likely to be diagnosed largely because women are societally conditioned to be quiet and well-behaved--which superficially masks many of the more obvious symptoms, especially in looking at primarily hyperactive type. That's amplified by the fact that doctors don't take women as seriously (lol she's hormonal, women are just weak, etc). This has been verified empirically in numerous studies. When women who seek evaluations report their symptoms, they're not believed.

Having conversations exactly like this one is the way that we can all become better informed and understand the other side. Men have a large voice in the discourse already, so to give women space to share their experience, we as men can take a minute and stop making this all about us. Don't take that away by trying to drag the conversation back to being about men. 

 Men, especially white men, are the default in these discussions, in medical research and mental health. Minorities and women often have to have special information because their differences are otherwise overlooked, ignored, or possibly never discovered at all. Gender is so important when we talk about mental health. Men are more likely to be successful in suicide attempts. Mental health care does need to take into account gender differences for biological reasons as well as social ones - we have different nurturing.

Having specialized care that has a specific focus - ie women with adhd - is important. It doesn’t mean we are taking attention away from men. In fact, men are much more likely to be diagnosed, and much less likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression.

I understand the concern that we may pass up men, but there is no evidence to support that - in fact the evidence supports quite the opposite. Make your own goddamn discussion for men.  Problem solved.  There are plenty of MRAs who would be happy to talk to you, I'm sure.  You'll fit right in. Doctor bias kills and maims ~~fat~~ women all the time.

&#x200B;

Why draw lines in the sand? All women of many different body types suffer from this bias. Please don't hijack the message for your personal gain. No it doesn’t. Lol. 

Fat women who claim this are upset that doctors suggest weight loss for things that are the product of excess weight. A good doctor is going to work with you to help improve your weight to fix or help your bad knees, for example, instead of stuffing you full of painkillers to mask the issue. But so many people insist that doctors are fatphobic assholes because “waaaah he told me that I need to lose weight to fix my sleep apnea and my bad knees and my prediabetes and my back but doesn’t he know this is my set point?!?!?!?!? Doesn’t he know that I’m beautiful no matter what???”

Doctors don’t tell people to lose weight bc they hate fat people. Doctors tell people to lose weight because it is either the cause or an exacerbating factor of the ailment at hand. It’s not personal. 

Source: am fat woman who isn’t interested in hearing how against me the world is  What the actual fuck.  My ex was like that too! He told me I was whining whenever I mentioned that I was cutting. He also said he was offended when I wasn’t open with him. There was never a way to win with him. I can’t imagine what marrying a guy like that would be like. Glad you got out of there. :’( Yo, the hospital visit for the birth of my second kid, my dude wouldn't look me in the eye, avoided talking to me at all costs, and when I needed something, he'd start arguing with me.

Like, at some point the nurses caught on and just did his emotional support job for him. The birth of the first, he was giddy and supportive and involved. The second one, tho, he was locked on to his phone or laptop, and clearly saw the whole thing as an imposition. 

He was so shitty for the whole second pregnancy, that I basically decided I was never going to have another child with him.

And, now, I'm locked in to this position where I am raising my wonderful children, but have to keep on his case about being less combative with them... Which started when our first was an infant, but I didn't realize that it wasn't just anxiety, it was legit agitation with his first born (that he absolutely planned on and wanted).

And, I didn't accept it until I was pregnant with the second, called him on his unproductive attitude, which just made it worse.... 

I dunno, he's a total brat. I love him, but when he always said he wanted kids, I thought he knew what he was fucking talking about.  For a long time, those conversations were entirely unproductive.... He'd just see it as a green light to "fight back" against everything at all costs.

But, over the last few years, since I brought it up, I can point to examples as he's lashing out, that he does, in fact, lash out. And he's very severely critical of me and can't communicate productively with me, at all, ever.

It's more productive now, he knows more about himself than he ever has, because, for real, no one ever challenged him before, and he was very sheltered and spoiled.

Like, at first, he was Mr Happyface to me, all his friends and family. For years, he kept this facade. But when he finally dropped it, it turned out he was full of lava. And I'm not the only person who ever saw that side of him.

And it's completely fucking awful.

But, because I don't lose my cool as easily or as completely, I can reign him in after fizzled out, and point out that how he acted is not okay, not my fault, and his job to fix.

For context, tho, my dad was a huge asshole, but in different ways, but I had to take the same sort of stance with him when I was a teenager. 

It's a tough job, I don't recommend marrying an asshole.  Sorry I couldn't be more specific to help your search. She is a social worker that is very immersed in the mental health field (and has ADHD herself). I do trust what she says, but it's hard to talk about an article that I haven't read myself. Exactly the point I was making. I wasn't hyper as a kid. I was shy. Smart but did terrible in school and no one could figure out why. ADHD was never considered since I never got in trouble in school.

Took 30 years to find out "chatty, excitable, “silly”,dreamy, spacy, quiet" was also an adhd thing. I'm male. ADHD-pi.

 Girl. Real talk. I'm usually more mean to myself than others but sometimes my meds wear off and I turn into such a dang diva I absolutely agree...and you bring up a great point about the mindset of an adhd (especially one who has spent time living in poverty) but since I did spend nearly a third of my life  homeless or living in motels/my car, I would just like to say that while a very helpful thing, it’s really not an option for a very, very large percentage of people. Irregardless of if they change certain aspects of their budgeting. 

Its just frustrating to see that same point being written about, and when you’ve lived that kind of life it’s very hard to not feel even more like a failure when it’s talked about like a perfectly normal thing to pay people to do your daily chores. 

(I’m not longer homeless, btw. I spent my 20’s in an abusive relationship and am now very lucky to be living a fantastic (and very middle class) life) 
 I’ll definitely check out things online and I was actually thinking it might be time to find a new Doctor. I just feel like he doesn’t care about my best interests and if I can find one that offers behavioral therapy that’ll be even better. Thanks for the advice, I sincerely appreciate it!!  Also again, very subjective with almost no evidence. To say that women are treated more harshly is a ridiculous statement considering the shear amount of possibilities and variables you can’t even take into consideration. To say that “us men” should take a step back and not make this all about us is directly you trying to hush our voice. I doubt any reasonable man will always try to make himself the center of a discussion, so to say that we need to stop talking about men in discussion because we are “default” in most studies, is saying that I need to oppress myself because of something, I, and MANY others, had no part in. So if men have always had the floor, where is the discussion for this topic about men? There are a fundamental lack of support groups for men because people like you believe that discussion about anything medical related is always about men by default. So don’t say I’m trying to “drag the conversation back to men” when there wasn’t a conversation for us to begin with. Also, personal question, why do you feel the need to sell out your own gender? Have you previously just had bad experiences with people of the same gender as you? Or are you just trying to white knight the situation to get the approval of women on the internet. I’m pretty sure to be taken seriously for your study or thesis, you must take all factors into consideration including race and gender. Saying they’re a default for medical discussion is such an extremely broad and unbacked statement to say about all medical research. But whatever, it’s always about those privileged white men. Nice hostility. Just pointing out the fact that this post and your comment are trying to cater only towards women by making it out to be that women struggle harder with ADHD than men because of social standards. Which is entirely subjective and writes off any standard men are held to For their personal gain? As an overweight woman who also works in healthcare, this is accurate.  Doctors are paid to let you know about health risk, regardless of how great your body image is.  I’m otherwise pretty healthy, but if my cholesterol became problematic or my joints started deteriorating and a doctor didn’t mention weight, they wouldn’t be doing their job. They also have a different perspective - they see the obesity epidemic as an added strain on resources that are already incredibly thin (no pun intended).   This is so unfuriating ! How dare you! So every fat woman who speaks out about the violence she faced in a doctor's office is a liar because you are fat and you decided that this isn't true. 

When I was giving birth to my 1st child and in more pain that I've ever been in my life, the anesthesiologist took upon him to lecture me about my weight and how I shouldn't have been pregnant in the 1st place. One thing he said to me that stuck is that : "giving birth is equivalent in terms of energy to running a marathon. Can you see yourself running a marathon right now?" Now tell me : do you know a lot of women who feel up to running a marathon when they're 9 months pregnant ? When they're in labour? This is just a small part of the bullying he did (because yes that is bullying) and unfortunately only 1 example among dozens of a medical professional who decided that humiliating me about my weight was more important than treating me.  I’m sorry to hear it. Sounds a lot like my ex. Was so into it with the first, the second was just an imposition on him. When he lost his job and I became the breadwinner and then later left, I will say he changed a lot. Rose to the occasion when forced to. Still clueless, detached, and not engaged with them a lot, but being forced into primary caregiver role woke him up. He’s the same person who hated our dog and even kicked and beat him at first, to where my naturally sweet natured dog would snarl at him. After I told him it was him or the dog (pre divorce) he actually came around and they are best friends now. I guess where I failed was teaching him how to love me, he was neglectful and dismissive to the point of abusive yet was so shocked when I left. Wish I saw it all more clearly then. My self-esteem was so low I was better able to advocate for my dog than myself. And I also see now how all these ADHD traits were such a big part of that.  > I do trust what she says, but it's hard to talk about an article that I haven't read myself.

Ah no worries, I just wanted to read it that was all. :) That’s terrible. I didn’t get diagnosed until this year and I am 28. 

There does need to be better education for teachers and parents on the different forms of ADHD that affect both men and women/boys and girls. TIL allowing men not to be the focus of every conversation = men oppressing themselves Man, that oppression must be rough. I'd love to dialogue more, but I doubt anything productive would come of it. I hope you can realize eventually how good you have it, and how ridiculous you sound, but I'm not holding my breath. Hahahahahaha 

you know it’s only been the last few years we’ve required researchers test medication on both male and female mice, right? Because researchers preferred using male mice so they wouldn’t have to deal with messy hormones and cycles. Yes, the vast majority of medications available to men and women, some “for” women were only tested on male animal models. How many drugs were thrown out because of this? How many went on to human testing, only to discover more problematic issues in women? Which, you know, before the mid 90s, we also didn’t require gender parity in human studies.  Even now, there is often less gender parity in studies than we would want to believe and iirc women are only required to be included in drug trials funded by the government.

Yes, it does come down to privilege. Literally in this discussion because you are failing to see the privilege of being assumed to be the default, therefore seeing the outgroup discussing their own issues as exclusionary. I mean what can be more privileged than getting to be the default human?

I am not discussing race beyond the recognition that while and male are considered the default, because the topic at hand is on a book that discusses experiencing adhd as a woman, and that is what you are objecting to. You can try and move the goalposts to distract from your weak argument, but that is really all it is, an attempt to distract.
 😂😂😂😂 I can't with this person Or, you know, the book that is topic of discussion makes assertions about how women struggle with adhd in different ways then men, and the discussion is the OPs experience with reading the book. 

Not only that, the suggestion, as you assert, is not that it is harder for women, but that it is different living with adhd as a women because of some important differences in how men and woman are raised. You alone are making the value judgement at the difference outlined in this thread equal an assertion that adhd is more difficult for women.

Are differences in the expression of a disorder between men and women a thing women are supposed to discuss? Are we even allowed to talk about how ADHD affects us differently during different times in our cycles because how our hormones fluctuate and the role estrogen plays in focus? How about that symptoms worsen during perimenopause and menopause again because of changing hormones effects on the brain? 

Or are we not allowed because that is too exclusionary towards men? Or is it only the different social and cultural pressures women face as separate from men we aren’t allowed to discuss. I suggest reading the book. It is not suggesting that women have it worse. It is not subjective. It presents all information with scientific, peer researched studies, as well as personal stories from real women affected with ADHD.

Men are women are different, and ADHD presents itself differently.

Again, I encourage you to read the book. Your concerns are valid but there is certainly no suggestion that women struggle more within the book. Perhaps it seems that way because there are no books written specifically for men or boys with ADHD, although I think that would benefit the community greatly (specifically how male social roles add a unique struggle for those with ADHD - being the breadwinner, being dominant, etc).  When will men finally be the focus of modern medicine?  When will women finally stop talking to each other about their problems?  Stay strong.  You will rise above buddy.   weight gain maybe? As an overweight woman who also works in healthcare, I was born with a blockage in my kidney that caused me extreme pain.  Three docs I saw suggested that if I lost weight, the problem would resolve itself.  A fourth doc finally referred me to a urologist, who gave me a CT w contrast.  Bam, blockage discovered, blockage fixed.  I spent three years with these symptoms because I was fat.  Now if that had been cancer, I'd be dead, and that's something that happens to fat people a lot, as well as to people who are super skinny.  Doctors have biases too. I didn’t decide anything. Where is the violence? What exactly do you think violence means??? Doctors don’t engage in violence because it is literally antithetical to their intentions. 

Yeah you’re not burning as much calories pushing out a kid as running a marathon but clearly that’s not what he meant. The physical demands of childbirth are difficult for anyone, and more so for overweight and obese women, the same way a marathon is. Hard for everyone, harder if you’re out of shape and especially if the shape you’re in makes it more difficult for the pregnancy to succeed without complications. 

Anesthesia has to be administered according to body weight and potential complications such as airflow blockage increase significantly with an overweight patient. Proper positioning for birth or for surgical intervention can be made difficult by the presence of excess weight. Complications increase with weight: gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, premature delivery, issues with ensuring the appropriate amount of anesthesia is used. The chances of miscarrying before you even get to worry about the birthing process are significantly higher. If you need a c-section, being obese makes that harder and increases the chances of infection. Children born to obese mothers have higher chances of NTDs and of being obese or diabetic later in their own life. 

 Telling someone who is overweight that they’re overweight - especially in a medical context where the weight is a direct mitigating factor in the care and treatment of the patient - isn’t bullying. And depending on a given patient’s weight, sometimes they SHOULDNT be pregnant at that time, because the risks to mother and baby are very real and can be very dangerous. I know that sounds cruel, but biology doesn’t care about how it sounds.

My point is that pregnancy is already complicated. Weight makes it more so. Maybe your anesthesiologist lacked some bedside manner, but again: doctors aren’t there to tell you things just to make you feel good, including giving you a clean bill of health when it’s not warranted, or to ignore physical conditions that can cause problems because it might offend someone to point them
out. They’re there to treat you, and sometimes they require your cooperation. If you want a doctor interested in your feelings, you’ll have to visit a psychologist. 

I’m sorry you endured complications in pregnancy and birth, and I hope it all turned out okay for you and your little one. But I hope you understand that just because you had one bad experience with a prick anesthesiologist doesn’t make me or all the other fat women who have gone to the doctor without incident liars either.  It sounds like you had a terrible experience, and I don't want to detract from that, but take a few deep breaths and calm down a bit. I don't mean that in a rude way, but in a soothing, we all have ADHD way.

Like so many issues, there are two sides to it. Do fat women get stereotyped? ABSOLUTELY. And I wholeheartedly agree that there are a lot of fat women who have real medical issues that need treatment and are told just to "lose weight". 

But on the other side, being fat is unhealthy and can cause so many problems. 

It also is a bit of a subjective thing: are the doctors really being abusive? Some doctors are very blunt. They will say "you're morbidly obese and this is going to kill you if you don't get it under control", that's not abusive. Maybe being overweight means you're sensitive to anyone talking about it, and that's kind of understandable. 

Now, I wasn't in the room for your birth, but maybe it wasn't so much of a lecture as a warning for how dangerous the whole procedure was going to be. Maybe the anesthesiologist would have difficulty administering to you because of your weight, since it's all done according to weight. I mean, giving you anything could have killed you or hurt the baby.

This is also an ADHD subreddit, so while I wholeheartedly empathise with what must be difficulties in your life due to your weight and the perceived biases you face, perhaps this isn't the place?

 Yeah, but it isn't our job to teach our partners how to have empathy or compassion.

I'm sorry you had to go through this too. It's unfair to treat a partner like a scapegoat, and take them for granted.  Yeah it definitely sounded interesting! I tried to ask her if it was because of sexism (minimizing their concerns) or due to presentation differences between sexes, but she didn't really give me a straight answer. Someone else commented that since research often focuses on men, women will have slightly different symptoms and will have a harder time being diagnosed, so I wonder if that's related. Its the old squeaky wheel that gets the oil situation. Trouble makers will always get noticed more. Silent agreeable types won't get noticed till much later and normally because of self examination. 

I've heard its the same of women with autism. They don't get noticed, because young boys are more of a handful essentially. 


But anyway yeah. How have things been for you since you realized this was what was going on? I had a whole, relief phase, then an anger phase - depressed phase then mostly a content phase with a lot of worry for the future though. 

But yeah because of adhd-pi I read posts like yours and know its very relevant to me as more often than not when people talk about women with adhd its really adhd-pi they're talking about so its still mostly relevant to me too. So thanks for making a post about it as the book may well have value for me too :)  But give me evidence that they’re the focus of every conversation. That’s the point I’m trying to get across meh I completely agree that these biases exist and wrong diagnoses occur.  If you were having pain, it should’ve been investigated rather than blaming weight or suggesting that weight loss would solve things.  What I meant was when there is evidence of risk correlating weight and an accurate diagnosis, it should be discussed.   > Doctors have biases too.

I can maybe defend the doctors a little if you do not mind. 
They were probably (hopefully?) working from a list of symptoms and coming too a diagnostic from those symptoms and maybe that three out of four times the right move would be loosing weight. They also might just be thinking in auto pilot and the easiest answer made most sense to them. (I am implying that you might be overweight here...sorry)

Sure they might have been biased but by assumption they have those biases from dealing with a lot of people and when you are a general practitioner you deal with the general ailments and so form ideas on large groups of people that might have similar looking traits. 

The human brain tends to optimize large repetitive tasks (like driving) so it can theoretically use less energy, they do so by falling into a patterns of habit(bias) and that habit might be seeing women coming into a doctors office with obvious weight related issues and describe weight loss because it saves time or has often been the case for correct treatment. 
 
I am generalizing very heavily here also so please tell me if I am wrong in any of those reasons and assumptions I listed.  Please explain why you think it's in an anesthesiologist's scope of practice to advise laboring women on their weight. > women will have slightly different symptoms and will have a harder time being diagnosed.

It all depends heavily on the specifics of the symptoms. Women with ADHD are under diagnosed compared to men but then women are more diagnosed with anxiety, depression and other classically failed coping mechanism that can be traced back to untreated ADHD, it seems like women are primarily inattentive ADHD(like mine is). 

 I personally did not get diagnosed until much later in life despite knowing some of my classmates were diagnosed with the disorder, I felt alienated and hurt because of that as I lost so much time and effort in dealing with the outright rejection and outrage I got by just not getting being like others and was described as slow, with a wandering mind that was hard to understand. Very much like the original post says, living in your own world cut of from others who would reject you so easily. I am a male but was isolated by my own head of ideas and thoughts that seemingly had no trajectory, fooled 
 in thinking that I was lesser than my piers. The chaos is still there mind you but I get better at hiding it, managing it and obsessively nitpicking my every action as I was taught in childhood. 

Case in point; Casus belli.  An act or reason to hate one self, very similar for many inattentive ADHD. 
 😂😂😂😂😂 Your lack of self awareness is just beautiful!   Serious question, are you new to the internet?  You're sea lioning pretty hard and it's as if you honestly believe this is a good way to conduct yourself Sure it should, but I think that the point of the fat bias comment was about stories like mine, which are all too common- not about how much we hate providers telling us to lose weight. I actually work in healthcare.  Thanks for taking up for us, but no, there was no reason in the world to believe that excruciating flank pain was caused by my weight, especially the quality of the pain.  These providers barely listened whatsoever.  It's possible that they thought I had a pinched nerve somewhere due to my weight, but a few follow up questions- or even just listening to the things I was telling them- would have sent up a few red flags.

Also, I said in my comment that I was overweight at the time, no need to apologize lol Because they may be required to intervene in the process and because the weight of the patient is only one of many things that need to be taken into account when administering anesthesia and monitoring the patient past that. 

Doctors get to say stuff about your health and about stuff that might affect it. Sorry if that sucks or makes you feel bad but I’m not about to spend 35 dollars on a copay just to feel angry about the fact that my doctor said something about my weight because that’s his JOB and if he’s not expressing concern about it then he’s not doing his job correctly.  Yeah I hear ya, I've suspected my diagnosis for a few years but only just got confirmation from my doctor this year and I'm 24. I didn't have issues in school when I was younger but I felt like I had a hard time making friends and I have lots of insecurities now. It sucks but it's so nice to know there's a reason for it and there's a community of people that understand this feeling. I hope you are in a better place now than you were before and aren't just suppressing your feelings. > would have sent up a few red flags.

Probably correct to seek the second opinion then. :)

> Also, I said in my comment that I was overweight at the time, no need to apologize lol

Better to be safe then sorry as some people are very delicate and I found it just polite to preface that I did assume as your own doctors assumed that the best course of action was to describe weight loss. :)  

 I think you completely misunderstood what I said (or simply don't want to understand). When I go see a doctor, my weight is not a taboo and I have many examples of medical practitioners mentionning it while also being respectful. 

To give you an example related to the 1st one : it happened when I went to the anesthesiologist consultation a few weeks before my due date. The doctor (not the one I ended up with on the day of delivery unfortunately) said to me straight away that due to my weight I might not be eligible to a peridural. I wasn't too happy about it but I knew it might happen. Then he checked my back and said to me that I was really lucky because although I am overweight my spine was clearly visible which meant that I could have a peridural after all. So him mentionning my weight was relevant and I wasn't hurt about it.

There was no respect on the day of my delivery. Just a sadistic asshole who was in position of power over me and used it to bully me. Yes it was bullying. I was in pain and scared and this doctor just used his position as the only anesthesiologist available to me to force me to listen to his endless rant about my weight. There was no intention of helping me in any way. It was just someone expressing how I was a failure again and again and again. My husband had to excuse himself because he felt he was about to punch him. The midwife who was assisting him came back alone and apologised on account of him. So this was not just my feelings you know.

And yes, my baby and myself ended up being fine thank you for asking. But his birth remains one of my worst memory, not only due to this man, but he was part of it. It's not the job of anesthesiologist who's giving a laboring person an epidral to advise that person on their weight.  How much weight do you think she could lose in five minutes?  

Have you experienced labor, also? Downvote away, it won't change the fact that you're talking out of your ass  I am in a very good place right now and thank you. :) Sure haven’t but my fat mother sure did giving birth to me and it nearly killed her! Because of her weight! But I don’t know anything of what I’m talking about.  Maybe just hear the message? They're obvi not expecting you to lose the weight in 5 minutes. Although, you could Polyanna the situation; If you're giving birth, at some point, you will eventually lose some weight in 5 minutes.  Facts don’t care about your feelings!! Funnily enough I’m downvoting you because you’re not contributing anything to this conversation except more appeals to emotion. 

 😂😂 1) I work in healthcare.  2) I had a textbook perfect pregnancy and birth while edit: fat, so I've experienced labor. 3) I have taken OB courses Tell yourself that all you want 😙 Ohhhhhhhhhhh GOD i’m so sorry then jesus christ forgive me holy shit i didn’t realize i was talking to someone who took courses!!!!!

I’m trying to figure out the point you’re making and what makes you qualified to do so. So far all I see is you saying that you got lucky in your pregnancy and that you think doctors don’t have the right to comment on their patients’ health or physical condition. If you have anything else to clarify I’d love to hear it. 

Edit before I’m maliciously misrepresented: when I say “lucky” I mean anyone would be “lucky” with a complication-free and comfortable pregnancy and delivery, not just fat women.  Clearly you haven't actually read any of my comments, or you would have learned something, but an anesthesiologist is there to give anesthesia.  It's not in their scope of practice to advise patients on their weight.  When they say so.ething about your weight, that's their opinion, not part of their care for you. But it's clear that you're not up for listening to anyone who knows what they're talking about, so peace out, homeslice.   Clearly you think you’re smarter than I am and have no intentions of a dialogue, only an argument or a brow-beating, so this conversation’s over as I’m not interested in being belittled. 

If someone is pumping drugs into me and the efficacy of those drugs is dependent on my weight, and if my weight is a roadblock to the safe administration of said drugs then yeah, I want that person concerned about my weight, I want them to tell me what may arise because of my weight, and I certainly again hope that any doctor or nurse or medical professional would do the same. Maybe it’s too late at that juncture but I’d hope for a physician who’s honest with me about where I’m at with my care and what might make that care more difficult. Sorry but that’s how I feel about it. Maybe that’s not the view of the general public as to how their physicians treat them, but I want honesty and transparency. 

Enjoy your day. Try not to scream at any other fat women for not going through being fat the way you do. 

PS I can’t give birth naturally because my hips are too narrow but thanks for making me feel like a Real Woman for not going through labor and having a child of my own!  You sound like a smoker giving out someone in the medical field told them smoking was bad for them.  > If someone is pumping drugs into me and the efficacy of those drugs is dependent on my weight, and if my weight is a roadblock to the safe administration of said drugs then yeah, I want that person concerned about my weight, I want them to tell me what may arise because of my weight, and I certainly again hope that any doctor or nurse or medical professional would do the same. 

You should be and I can obviously see where you are going with this and preface it with that they seem to be oddly specific in their insults so I would guess they feel just a little bit derailed with your arguments. (taking it personally) 

The interesting thing also is that they seem to call back on the power of authority ("I work in the field", "how dare you tell me how I experienced it", "I was am giving birth") which is dehumanizing and kinda ignorant of them to not really see where you were going with this, which by my reading was actually pretty reasonable to be honest. 

They are at fault and have weak arguments and those arguments seem to be shutting the discussion down which is just plain sad to see...


Please don't be hard on your self, you did nothing wrong. 

 I don't think I'm smarter than yiu- I just KNOW I'm more knowledgeable than you about this. I like how you're arguing against points no one has actually made here  Thank you, I appreciate that. I got myself a little tangled up in trying to make my point I think, so I’m glad it wasn’t completely missed by others.  😂 My arguments are based in who is supposed to do pt teaching and when, what people's jobs are interdisciplinarily, and when pt teaching is effective and when it isn't.  Her arguments are that somehow, anyone anytime should be able to berate a patient about their weight, whether it's their job or not and whether it's an appropriate teaching moment (i.e., in the pain of labor or in times of stress, not a good time to teach).  Yes, I am an expert, and yes, that does mean I know better in this instance.  

Idc about her feelings in this instance bc she started in on some fat ppl version of "pick me," and then gave a woman shit for her very traumatic birth experience.  Well said.  > Her arguments are that somehow, anyone anytime should be able to berate a patient about their weight, whether it's their job or not and whether it's an appropriate teaching moment (i.e., in the pain of labor or in times of stress, not a good time to teach).

And in my opinion you misinterpreted what she was saying as I found that she was not saying or implying that but that is just me and how I saw it. 

>Yes, I am an expert, and yes, that does mean I know better in this instance.

I would then point out that you were berating this woman in a very unprofessional manner. If you would have been an expert you would  rather preference critique in an appropriate manner with clearer examples and better arguments. 

>Idc about her feelings in this instance bc she started in on some fat ppl version of "pick me," and then gave a woman shit for her very traumatic birth experience.

Its easier to be the critic I know but putting myself in her shoes for a moment highlights better the reasons for why she would point it out. You came off as overly arrogant in your arguments and you could easily guess that your view of the experience was overly influential by emotion hence she pointing out why a medical worker would say that.

She said that taking criticisms and feedback from a trained professional intending to help you might not be such a bad thing and I agree with her, don't you?


 Not here in a professional capacity, so I don't care how unprofessional I seem.  And yes I did berate her, and no I don't care to step into her shoes.  Because from her very first comment on this post, she tried to invalidate the experiences of people like me and like the woman who shared her childbirth story.  She displayed a complete lack of empathy, and I gave her some of her own medicine.  She couldn't handle it and got angry and defensive.

I have said much earlier in this post that obviously, someone's PROVIDER (also an appropriate member of the interdisciplinary team such as an RN on the med surg floor) is totally within their scope of practice to provide advice on weight loss.  But that was not the debate here, because the first comment I saw of hers was in response to a comment someone made that fat hate by providers kills people, which is true.  SHE is the one who then tried to make it about people getting their feelings hurt when. a doctor suggests weight loss.  The thread was originally about life and death situations like the one I described. 

I really don't care if you think I'm arrogant.  I'm sick and fucking tired of people acting like jerks when they know next to nothing on a subject, and then when people familiar with it come in to correct them, they freak.  Over it. > I really don't care if you think I'm arrogant.

Look I get where you are coming from and by the looks of it you had the best of intentions but you quickly anchored the rest of the discussion by the first impression you had of her. 

*  Anchoring is when the first thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows.

Anyway I do think it was all a misunderstanding and exhorting more effort over this is kinda pointless in the end.


 I think I understood her perfectly well.  It wasn't a first impression, it was the only impression.  She consistently made the same point.

Feel free to stop exerting energy tho. > She consistently made the same point.

Yes. Its easier to be dismissive rather then trying to dissect where that reaction came from. 

> Feel free to stop exerting energy tho.

Point taken, other view points are invalid.   

 😂😂😂 your lil cutesy "I'm so politely trying to dismiss this person's comments" act getting a bit hard to keep up, eh? 😉 Phrasing your insults and dismissal in a timid way is still being an asshole, just so you know. Act? I am rather actively dismissing it you know but would rather keep an open mind to it as I was hoping for a more reasonable discussion.  Speaking for my self;

I know but regretfully no effort was shown in ending this with a reasonable lets agree to disagree.  😂😂  Buddy, your very first comment to me was dickish and you know it.  Go to hell. > Go to hell.

Farewell.  First smart thing you've said.
