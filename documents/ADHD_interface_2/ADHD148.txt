Found My Creative Passion And Thinking About Transitioning Off Meds. I Can't Believe This Might End Well. I Used To Hate Reading These... So a man walks into his dr's office and says:

&nbsp;

> "When I move my arm like *this* it really hurts!"

&nbsp;

The Dr, demonstrating, replies drily:

&nbsp;

> "Then don't move your arm like *this*."

&nbsp;

How many times I have said or heard others with ADHD say:

&nbsp;

> "I can't seem to focus on things I'm not interested in."

&nbsp;

For me, the answer to my self-query of waning interest was and is:

&nbsp;

> I'm not going pursue anything major in my life that isn't (1) creative (2) is my passion and (3) has some potential benefit to others as at least as I can honestly see (obviously the road to Hell is paved with good intentions thus I honestly hope my time on this planet leaves it better...that is my aim at least)

&nbsp;

I had always known I had creative aims but never had the confidence to pursue them. I didn't have much family support growing up (didn't know my father and mother, in hindsight, was most likely dealing with ADHD or Manic Depression) and doing poorly at school married with never socially fitting in, left me scared of most aspects of life. I would say, scared of life.

&nbsp;

At 39 I can proudly say it took all these years to realise I don't have a choice in the matter: you love what you love and you are who you are consequences and society be damned.

&nbsp;

I always felt like I was on a movie set and everyone else had a script and knew what to do and I was left just wandering around marvelling at how everyone just innately knew what to do.

&nbsp;

The theme of my freshman literature class was "alienation" and not only did I identify I was living it. I was angry that the world would give everyone else direction but for me. It made me different and that difference was so pervasive, fundamental and alienating, I was disconnected from my peers, myself and the flawed nature that would create someone only to feel lost, confused and angry.

&nbsp;

I didn't realise how angry I actually was until I left home for college or before when I saw what a "normal family" and "normal" people looked like. They persisted in activities, had friends and what upset me the most is they were indeed good people. They lived with ease possessed this ability to elegantly balance social, academic and relationships, in general, utilizing some fundamental device or technology that I didn't even know where to begin looking for.

&nbsp;

If it was me vs the Universe that would put someone in such a vulnerable, painful position then I had to make sure I gave the Universe little openings to fuck me over further. Therefore, I had to get a practical job, make money to support myself so I could have the stability and financial power to protect myself from the world and the alien people in it.

&nbsp;

For me, this was, what they would call in Buddhism, wrong view. You are part of nature. Holding a grudge against the Universe is a form of self-loathing and self-hatred as you are a part if not one in the same. 

&nbsp;

Despite not having a great family, I did have access to nature. Fishing, bike riding, atv'ing(is that a word?) and just trail walks calmed me the fuck out. Whatever I have, nature is part of the cure. 
Nature and I had a silent agreement that we would look out for each other. I never discussed it and since everyone loved being outdoors and spoke highly of their outdoor experiences I thought this was common to everyone.

&nbsp;

School and social awkwardness ruined that relationship. Fuck this world. Why am I going through this? What am I going through? WTF is wrong with me?

&nbsp;

Fast forward 20 years later, 100k+ in college/university fees (left college came back more times than I literally know; still no degree but going back in the summer(did I mention how stubborn I am?)) and not getting diagnosed until my late 30's, I have rebuilt that bond I broke with nature. It's like going from rowing up a waterfall to casting your sail on a calm lake and just watching where life takes you. The burden is shifted and you are along for the ride. Life has a rhythm and a pace and an ease about it.

&nbsp;

How did I get to this place? Well these were I guess my interesting realisations along the path:

&nbsp;

* there are non-judgmental thoughts. Really? Not mine they were all about as judgmental and hard on me as could be.

&nbsp;

* to accomplish any task I had to place an "emotional gun" to my head and get into a fight-or-flight state. Medication (will get into later) and meditation (interesting they both have the same root?), gave me this infant form of self-love/caring that I refused to place that gun to my head anymore. I saw how I killed myself over the decades and that it was me doing it is sadly amazing. I refuse to beat myself up anymore. I don't care what the consequences are.

&nbsp;


* I don't have to follow thoughts. I was so conditioned to just following what came to mind that I didn't realize that was distraction. It's hard to explain but something would pop up, I would get excited and follow it. I thought that's just who I was and had no idea that was what distraction was. I do remember the first time I thought, "I don't have to follow that rabbit!" WTF does that mean I don't know that was the thought. Perhaps like a dog my instinct will chase a rabbit like I was chasing my thoughts? No clue just popped into my head.

&nbsp;

* meditation which builds awareness is more beneficial than exercise or meds (which are also VERY useful in their own way). I had to take a stimulant to get the energy and calm to meditate.

&nbsp;

* you don't sacrifice sleep unless someone is dying or something is on fire. Just like we need more breaks and perhaps longer than most, some "normal" people can do without sleep for us its as optional as oxygen. I love nights, hated morning and LOVED hyperfocus, 4 am deep dives but it basically ruined my life. 

&nbsp;

Finally the MOST important thing from this journey: doing what you love. At 38 at the time, I was behind. No time to play around with hippie-dippie delusions of being artistic or creative. I had to put my head down, write that todo-list and start making up lost ground.

&nbsp;

Forcing a career or interst on yourself is akin to forcing yourself to go to sleep: the harder you try the less success you can have. I think those with ADHD see mendacity in outhers and also find it hard to NOT say the honest thing (often at the most inapproriate time and to great humor and outrage...good times) and even to themselves. I think those WITHOUT adhd have an easier time deluding themselves or compramising perhaps with doing something that isn't exactly their passion (Just my theory most likely wrong).

&nbsp;

Ya the lie to yourself thing I don't do well. It is like small talk or lines... ya I don't do that.

&nbsp;

So now that I have said consequences be dambed and I'm doing something that I have always wanted and never had the courage to do what has changed? Everything.

&nbsp;

Energy levels through the roof. I am thinking about stopping meds entirely. I start upon diagnosis with ritalin went to max of 80mg SR. Then tried Vyvanse, then back to methylphenidate with Concerta, now I take vyvanse but some days I don't and I'm not noticing a big difference.

&nbsp;

I think not doing what you deem as meaningul leads to depression. I might have been depressed until very recently. I feel in flow with life and not working against it or butressing myself against it's next curve ball it has consistently thrown at me so many times and just when I thought "This time is different!"

&nbsp;

The best way to describe my inner dialogue is that of signal and noise. The noise of discursive thoughts is still there but muted. They aren't as "charged" or emotional. There is some detachment and spaciousness and they don't sweep me away.

&nbsp;

That script that others had? I do now have a pacing to my life. There is a natural beat and everything doesn't need to be timed and I don't have to live off of todo lists.

&nbsp;

My anxiety is waaaaayyyyyy down. I'm not waiting or forumulating ways for the next proverbial shoe to drop in every situation. I'm not endlessly replaying social interactions to see who or what I did, said that wasn't socially acceptable.

&nbsp;

Clearly this could end tomorrow. But that's ok. Even when I say it there isn't the old familiar pang of anxiety "NOT AGAIN!!!" It is what it is. But suppose I fail in this creative endeavor? You could end up peniless on the street!!!! Great, I'll have lots of time to meditate and I won't have tons of financial worries. Embracing the worse case scenario I found very useful:it difuses fear which defaltes anxiety which unloads the emotional gun of your inner dialogue.

&nbsp;

Another helpful technique:

&nbsp;

> "Would you treat your son or daughter this way?"

&nbsp;

Dominate component of ADHD for me was NEGATIVE inner dialogue. Nasty, nasty, nasty. I was so hard on myself so consistently that I really was left with: "be" or "not be." Problem was I couldn't just "be". "Being" wasn't going to pay the bills and worse I had no idea where to start. Finally, I think I was really good at tourturing myself. I truly think Hell is in the mind and my mind was a living hell.

&nbsp;

To those reading this thinking well I have it worse a taste of my mind state at most times was suicide was a positive influence for me as it an escape hatch I knew I could use if I wanted the pain to stop. I literally used thinking about suicide as a way to calm down and I guess of a type of "white flag" you win life enough. 

&nbsp;

I hated reading these posts. I would get angry at the OP, think they really didn't have adhd and partly hope it didn't last since I viewed not getting better as just failing at healing too. Great add it to the pile!

&nbsp;

I get it. I never knew whatever I am experiencing existed. Maybe I'm just coming out of a life long depression but I have read about every book on adhd, every video, seminar, newsletter Russell Barkley has made (I like to refer to him as God II as he was integral in giving back to me the life God I created) and basically I have/had every symptom.

&nbsp;

Is this what normal people feel daily? Will this end by lunch? It's been about 3 months of routine and 1-2 really good months of just being ok with being. Low anxiety, muted inner dialogue just kind of going with the flow.

&nbsp;

I had low energy due to following every thought, getting too emotional about my thoughts and being depressed because I wasn't on the career path I was supposed to be. Medication, for me, provided the energy to get a depressed person out of bed and moving in some direction. This experience forever changed my view of medication.

&nbsp;

Mindfulness meditation, which meds made possible, are helping me hone my awareness so I can see when my mind is wandering. Implicit in meditation is self-love and caring as you, for instance in breathing meditation, "non-judgementally" bring your mind back to the breath if you catch it wondering.

&nbsp;

Monastic elements have helped me tremendously: clean work area, few possessions, work on 1 thing at a time... Eastern views on life and nature were very key to me getting out of my self-made Hell.

&nbsp;

Jesus wasn't a Christian, Buddah wasn't a Buddhist and what worked for me most likely won't work for you. And yes I just put myself amongst the ranks of Jesus and Buddah, good peeps. Religion tried to generalise their founder's experience to the population at large and you can see the results (Buddhism to be fair has done a pretty good job).

&nbsp;

Also I was ready for the change. You might not be so be kind and patient with yourself. Focuse on the todo items you have done or the negative things you now abstain from doing. Being hard on yourself isn't going to free you it's what imprisons you.

&nbsp;

Acceptance, surrender, compassion, letting go, self-love... I hated hearing about that cliche shit but I see it as the way out. I respect them now and I respect my role in this Universe as passive and listening.

&nbsp;

ADHD forced me to deal with these issues if I liked it or not. I too could not focus things I didn't have interest in. The interest I did have was manic for bursts then would always crash and burn soon after. But there might be something that is so dear to you and captivating that your interest will persist. I had given up looking. Using college as a venue for exploration was painful for me and only made things worse. I hate every aspect of "higher" learning but a piece of paper doesn't define who I am.

&nbsp;

Anyway, that is my journey in a nut shell and will report back as I taper off meds. Currently on 20-50 mb Vyvanse a day, but once again, it doesn't seem to effect me much. Vyvanse never has really had a huge effect but maybe it's just subtle and I am not aware of it. Perhaps meditation will help me reach a level of awareness where I can tell the difference.

&nbsp;

I view everyone with ADHD as my brothers and sisters. There are so many common experiences between us: "Are you me?" Maybe. If so, I'm wishing the other parts of myself the best of luck. Never look down on yourself or compare yourself to others. Though superficially others might fit into life a little better with the current game we are playing this century everyone is drowning and dealing with issues. I wish you the best in dealing with yours.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR** think creativity and vocation change have diminished tremendously many symptoms of my ADHD. So I really can't read all of this, but I'm guessing that your life values no longer support you being on meds, and that the only reason you ever truly chose to be on meds in the first place is because you weren't able to succeed in what you thought you *had* to do? If so, I commend you for that realization. Sorry about the downvotes. You can always check out r/sociology to learn more about how society works and how people get alienated. It is not just mental disorders and social class. Race and gender also plays a role. We people who don't confirm to the "norm" are basically what they call "deviants" in sociology. Nope, there isn't a law in society which states that procrastination is illegal, but there are definitely informal means of control within society and shaming deviant behaviour is one of them. You may be interested in reading about [interconceptionality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) to see how different forms of discrimination in society are interconnected.

If you are happy with your life, you are more likely to be motivated to work and improve yourself ADHDer or not. I suspect many neurotypicals also hate their jobs and are unhappy with their marriages. Kind of funny how most people fail to find happiness despite chasing for it. Sometimes we forget that many neurotypicals are unhappy with their lives as well. Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality
