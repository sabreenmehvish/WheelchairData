I just wrote a two-page long post (usually they're half a page) for a closed forum I'm required to post to for my Master's degree. I had trouble reading the lesson before writing it, and only now (finally able to focus a little) do I realize my discussion-post-turned-essay is absolutely off topic. I was so excited to post it too :(. I was actually really invested in some of the points.

Oh...god I hope the other post I turned in for another class just an hour ago isn't just as off topic. There's no way I'm going back and looking right now.
