Hyperfocus, blessing and a curse Moving out in a couple of weeks so figured I start packing early. Found a simple sewing kit that I never used. Always wanted to tailor my clothes. While sorting through the closet I found a t-shirt that was too big. "Huh let me just fix this, how hard can it be".

Got a shirt that was the right size for comparison and looked up how to sew basic stitches.

That was 9 hours ago. **9 HOURS**. I sat there and worked on sewing that t-shirt the entire time. I didn't eat lunch or dinner, I didn't get up to pee, I didn't get water. I sewed that shirt for 9 straight hours. The worst part is I only managed to attach one of the shoulder sleeves and stitched close only one side. The stitch is also crap for my first time. 

I think what kept me going was that its a new task, a challenge. Honestly those stereotypical grandmas sewing in the rocking chair got it going on, because this was pretty meditative and fun. I am laying in my bed laughing right now... out loud. laughing with you of course... dont you just love the adventures of going through your own stuff? 🤣 Dude. Wait until you try knitting. It’s one of the best hyperfocusing activities I’ve ever found and it’s even better with an audiobook. Hahah yes!!! My best hyperfocus stories are about learning English. In order to stay in the states I had to pass a couple of  English tests for my student visa. I had lived here for like 2 months and I failed miserably, but the counselor felt bad for me and made up an excuse that my headset wasn’t working so I could retake it. I don’t deal well with failure, so I watched about 10-12 hours of tv/day for 2 weeks. At first with my native language subtitles, then with English subtitles, then without. Same with every movie I could get my hands on. It was pathological lol... but I passed my tests with flying colors.  I couldn’t get into ESL classes, so I had to take them with native speakers which was way more difficult. I would also spend about 40 hours writing one page because I just had to make every paper perfect. A girl in class complained that I got As and I didn’t even speak English ( I did. I was just quiet). How come she didn’t get As... it made me work even harder just to piss her off. 
Tell me I can’t do something or treat me like I’m a moron and my hyperfocus goes nuts.  Hyperfocus was a curse for a long time, until I figured out how to harness it so that I could pick what I used it on, instead of it picking *for* me & taking me along for a joyride lol. I hyperfocused on singing Halo by Beyoncé from 10 am to 4 pm. 6 hours. Of singing Halo. There were some workers staining our cabinets and my brother said they were actually laughing after several hours because I was singing the same song in my room all day.... Newly diagnosed and medicated here... And I have just discovered the miracle of a REASONABLE list and a smartphone timer.

I allow myself 30 minutes to write a list of the jobs I need to do then break them down into manageable and super simple tasks that shouldn’t take more than 25 minutes, making sure each block is quite different from the previous block. Then I connect my phone to a Bluetooth speaker and play a podcast, audiobook or the sound from a tv show I know well. Set a timer for 10 mins and put phone in another nearby room so every time you have to hit reset on the timer, it pulls you away from whatever you were doing and gives an easy indication of how much time has passed/a sense of urgency to get it done. (Yay reward centre)

I keep the list on paper with a pen wherever I'm working and cross off the jobs at the 30 minute mark. Anything I get distracted by gets written down in an extra list of things to do after the rest of the list is done.

My Wednesday afternoon was the most productive 3 hours I've had in a while!
It looked like this:
4-4.30: write list (also made tea, made bed and downloaded podcasts)
4.30-5: put all clothes from floor to bed for hanging or in a pile for washing. Took all dishes and placed on kitchen floor. Put all shoes and bags away. Piled up paper on desk.
5-5.30: washed dishes
5.30-6: put load of washing on. Put away clothes on bed.
6-6.30: choose clothes for holiday and dump on bed. Get toiletries ready.
6.30-7: hang up wet clothes, find credit card, message grandma about birthday, remind friend they owe $$, pay someone else $$, vacuum behind washing machine and clean the air-conditioning filter (the random jobs that would have taken over my night if I hadn't written them down!).

Usually I polish my shoes, make labels, rearrange my wardrobe, get distracted by paper monsters, cook up a feast, mindlessly eat, or even just stare at Facebook for hours, so yay for productivity!!

Good luck packing though - I don't envy you!!

EDIT: supposed to be rushing out to meet up with a friend but just realised that I've spent 30 minutes here... Damn! I recenlty decided all the stuff in my right pants pcoket was too bulky. I did what any rational person would and bought a whole bunch of crap to make my pocket more volume optimized. 

I waited for three days for my package from Amazon, and then put my optimization plan into action. 

My keys were taking up too much space, so I removed half of them that I couldn't name their purpose off the top of my head. Then I carefully lined them up by thickness so they would fit into my new "EDC" key holder. Still look up too much room, so I got out the power tools and cut off all but the actual ridged part of each key + a little bit so each will still work, and now they fit much better. We're talking bench grindersl and bandsaw.

I had to spend awhile googling to ID my Ford key, as it has a chip in it. Once I found the key, I moved onto googling until I found an image that let me know how I could cut and drill the key without hurting the chip. (the image speaks to the time required to find it: https://i.stack.imgur.com/D3aLr.jpg )

My wallet was overhauled in a similar slash/burn system. Removed half the cards, switched to a hyper thin card only wallet, and carefully folded all my bills with an off the cuff system which made it all fit better. 

Not sure how long it took total, but focused is an understatement. Much like typing this all out at 11:00pm because I'm not tired, just something that happened. 

and yes, my pocket is now much less bulky.  I completed a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle in 18 hours over the Holidays as a way to unwind from work. I stopped for 2 hours to eat and say hi to my kids. My wife wanted to kill me but it was totally worth it! lol

That other time my wife's necklaces were all tangled up in a big ball and she gave up. Took me two hours to detangle them all.

I think it's the novelty and the challenge that gets us hooked. Plus doing stuff like this is really soothing in a weird way. Lol! I once spent  most of a day - like 5 hours - researching the history and function of notaries. For no reason other than a reference on Parks and Rec. I didn't even realize how far down the rabbit hole I had gotten until my roommate came home from work and I realized it was 8pm. She walked in the door and I was like "Did you get off work early?" Haha whoops.  Hyperfocus, or the sheer insatiable need for stimulation both made me a genius and ruined me at the same time. yep... that way I've taught my dog to give a highfive and we're half-way on rolling over :')  (I keep accidentally typing god... freudian-slip?)  She only rolls over with her head and frontlegs.... :') it looks stupid :p 

The dog is really stoked about the amount of treats she's devoured in the past 2 days though :p  Decorating cakes with fondant was my hyperfocus activity. I’d spend 8+ hours on a single cake. Bright side is that I am now pretty decent at it (nowhere near professional) and proudly self taught! haha yesterday I went home by train but I missed my stop because I was busy googling some nonsense again. I only noticed 5 stops after mine and was like "where the hell am I?" My hyperfocus is weird. I get years into some broad topic, studying every little facet and get pretty good at it. Then just stop and move onto the next thing. These tend to be more life-focusing, though. I’ve learned so much about niche concepts and things.  When I first discovered chess, I spent 7 hours playing it on lichess. I still play it. If anyone's familiar with rating; I went from 700 to 1200, if anyone was curious. I'm at about 1150 right now and ended up loving chess.  It just takes practice. Use the super power, switch it off, use it, switch it off. You'll get better with practice. It's not like we're born knowing how to do things, right? I got up. I had some rough ideas as to what I was going to do with my day. Seven hours later I know a lot more about the fall of the Roman Empire (but not really because how much info did I actually retain) and haven't done a fucking useful thing. I hyperfocused yesterday for 4 hours on an article I was writing, and it was a bliss. 

It’s pretty frustrating though because I don’t seem to be able to do it on school projects and things that actually would be productive... I just recently got into cross stitching and it’s extremely easy for me to hyperfocus on. >The stitch is also crap for my first time

Yeah, 'cause it's your first time! :)

Glad you enjoyed yourself at least. <3 It's a blessing for me until I get interrupted - I can get furious when someone makes me snap out of it. Hyperfocus would be a super power if I could just choose what to focus on. \* cough \*cough like my homework The other day I hyperfocused for hours on Photoshop to make posts for r/sbubby

I've only posted one though, because I keep forgetting to post the rest...  <3 Haha, years ago I skipped school, breakfast, lunch, dinner and getting dressed to patch together a ~44 pin 2.5" and 3.5" IDE hard drive cable making a home made adapter. It works to this day. Don’t tell me I would have learned more at school that day.  I learned to knit and listened to Jane Eyre in like 3 sittings. It’s 40 hours. That was a great few days I was listening to an audiobook yesterday and kept thinking, what do people look at while they do this?! Suddenly, the idea of knitting hit me. Now I’m hyper focused on how to start knitting and have all but lost interest in the book. 💁‍♀️ Picking locks, easy to learn nigh impossible to master. It's been an amazing way to manage my fidgeting and allows me something I can lock onto with a cool little side skill as a bonus oh my god. pre-diagnosis I used to ask each of my professors if it was alright if i could bring knitting to class. I'd record the class using Evernote audio and just go.

Way better that way! I stopped crochet because it really hurt my hands after a while, but recently found WATERCOLOR PAINTING!

Omg it's amazing.  So addicting.  I am in love! Or building websites, writing copy, and making video ads. I started knitting around Christmas of last year and got lost in it for hours on end. But typical of ADHD, I lost interest in my shiny new hobby. I’m trying SO hard to get back into it.

Do you have any patterns that you’ve found particularly easy/easy to lose yourself in? I bought circular needles but am a bit intimidated.  You’re amazing. You can pick what you use it on? You must be a superhero ,😀 What's your strategy? HOW?! I really need to finish my bachelorsthesis in a week or 2 :') spill the beans haha 😂😂😂
I have never even realized that this was a form of hyperfocusing... I will do this with any favorite new song. Playing it over and over and over.... Making my kids and husband crazy when they're home for the insanity. Lol I do this on the same parts of a song. singing the chorus over and over like a broken record That’s why I have trouble commenting on reddit. I’m always afraid I’ll get even more lost here if I start a conversation by replying lol I already broke it down but I like the timer idea! http://i.imgur.com/YPDGaET.jpg That's awesome! You used your power for productivity. I used it to waste time... though I always think I'll get it done really quickly are you me Prolly could have saved some hours with /r/edc :) [deleted] That's awesome! Did you read that confession post here on Reddit about the cake mix? Hilarious. Don’t leave me hanging. What are some of the topics? That is dedication. Bravo Totally agree, so much of what I know were learned from trying to solve a challenging problem. Any tips for keeping track of your stitches? I learned to crochet to help quit smoking, but I've just crocheted and unraveled the same "scarf" dozens of times because because I can't come anywhere close to a straight line. Hahaha do it! Knitting is one of the only “ADHD hobbies” that I’ve stuck with for over 10 years. > something I can lock onto

Pun intended? It comes and goes for me! I found that tackling more techniques like lace and socks keeps me more entertained than just plain knitting. I’m a big Ravelry addict! Been on there since it was in beta and it’s a great place to find free patterns and see what kind of yarns and modifications others have made. Often, I just pick a yarn from my stash and set the Ravelry pattern browser to show me the most popular patterns in that weight and then just go with something. Antarktis is a really cool one that I have enjoyed knitting and he Find Your Fade Shawl is wildly popular right now. Also, I am 100% on circs as they are so much easier on the hands. I have used Knit Picks nickel interchangeables since they came out. Don’t be intimidated! It’s all just following instructions, one by one, that’s the best part. 😊 Nope, just figured out a system that works for me. Yeah man don't hog the secret  Not OP, but have a strategy. 

For me, there are 'critical moments'. They're usually at the start of the day, and last around 10 minutes. Whatever I'm doing during a critical moment is what I'll more or less be doing for the next three to six hours. Sometimes hyperfocusing, sometimes not. 

Sounds simple, right?

It's the absolute hardest time of the day, because in that moment, I NEED to completely rip myself away from videogames/youtube/books/anime and start working on what I SHOULD be doing. 

Successfully stopping/starting a task takes baby steps. Too many things at once, and I get overwhelmed and shut down. For example, instead of "starting the job search", I open my job search onenote page. After that, I log in to linkedin. 

Another key is to work on tasks the way YOU work on them (within reason). Too often I'll find myself drained from restricting my impulsiveness, so I let myself follow my task-related impulses. This results in multitasking, which isn't the most efficient way to work. However, it's certainly better than working on something for an hour and quitting from exhaustion. 

Things still aren't perfect. Some days are really rough, and I'll still procrastinate with things I have no excuse to delay. That in mind, perfect is the enemy of good. 

 One caveat: medication seriously helps with having the motivation to give enough of a fuck to try.  hmu on chat & I'll walk you through my thesis-writing procedure I play one song on loop when I'm working, because I get distracted in a silent room (road noise! Birdsong! Post! etc) and if i'm listening to a varied playlist I get distracted by tuning in and out to the track, or wanting to skip songs I'm tired of. But one medium-liked song, on loop, becomes like wallpaper... I stop hearing it, but I don't hear anything else. 

Wife gets profoundly sick of that song after awhile, and she's just hearing it in passing when she goes near my study. 

Longest single-song play was four days running, ten hours a day, one song. Over and over. Here's a sneak peek of /r/EDC using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/EDC/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!

^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/7o7jnj/blacklist/) Bored, so moved onto reading about how to make Mead, how 3d printers work, down the wikioedia rabbit hole, or just plain old Reddit. Lol I didn’t! I’ll have to look for it. In this sub? Cheers :) This is why I write.  I have so many ideas rattling around my head like pinballs the only thing that gives truest, sincerest and valuable expression to them...is writing. I can write all day without eating sleeping or thinking about anything else, until I crash, then get up and do it again.  Now I do it as my job because it’s the only thing that works! (Reference and pun intended). Yeah, I think people with ADHD are generally more attracted to real-life usefulness and results because those are salient and stimulating consequences tied naturally to the work being done. I don’t know how to crochet! So I don’t know if it’s similar to knitting or not. In knitting it’s obvious to tell when you reach your end... but I do VERY simple stitches and projects. I’ve tried more complicated things but mess up a lot because I stop paying attention  Err.... yeah definitely I absolutely did that on purpose I love Ravelry! I just need to get better at finding patterns that don’t require so many different needle sizes. I found a beanie I wanted to make but I needed two circ sizes and one DPN. It’s so expensive to get everything!

Thanks for all the info, though!! I’ll have to look at the patterns you recommended and add them to my queue. In a nutshell, it's kind of 2 parts:

1. System
2. Procedure

The **system** is more or less 2 pieces:

1. GTD
2. Plugins to manage everything in your life

GTD is action-management system designed to remove the storage of to-do's, list of actions, and reminders from your brain.  Think about it this way: whenever you're on the hook to do something, you have to remember to do it.  Then you have to think through the list of actions required to do that task.  Then you have to put a reminder of that task somewhere until you can get to it, because you're not always in the place you need to be to do it & you can't do more than one thing at once effectively.  With ADHD, we try to keep all of that in our heads, and we're typically very optimistic about what we can really get done, and we don't usually have a good track record of actually being productive.  So GTD offloads all of those things so that you can use your brain for thinking & doing, not storage.  So now your brain is "clear" all the time.  It is a very effective stress-management system, especially for people who struggle with ADHD.

But, there's also a lot of recurring housekeeping in life.  What I call "plugins" are just clearly-defined ways to deal with certain situations.  How do you handle your finances, laundry, dishes, house chores, weekly food menu, exercise, personal hygiene, sleep hygiene, car maintenance, etc.?  You have a zillion things to manage in your life.  Most of us have not "closed the book" on each of those items, where we've kind of locked down a system for managing each situation, and then stuck it in a system like GTD that takes care of tracking our to-do's, our lists of actions for each to-do item, and a reminder to do each to-do item.  Now take a step back & realize that most of us hold all of those things & more in our heads, so instead of being on top of everything, stuff either gets done late, or doesn't get done as well as we'd like, or doesn't get done at all.  So GTD helps get your mind clear & plugins help you kind of auto-manage all of the recurring stuff you have to deal with.  Both of those things require time & setup, both of which are pretty big barriers in the ADHD world, but the payoff if you stick with it & get an operational system, it then becomes very easy to stay on top of life.

So those two things more or less offload your brain's overflowing tornado.  Your brain is still going to operate ADHD-style, but with everything being managed in an external system outside of your brain, you're now going to be a lot more free to focus on what you want instead of being distracted by literally everything you come across in life.  So next comes the **procedure** for getting into hyperfocus mode.

Hyperfocus is more or less what the rest of the world calls "getting into the zone".  Instead of paddling against the current, you're shooting down a fast-moving river.  You're focused on whatever you're doing to the exclusion of everything else.  Everyone who has ever watched a really good movie where you're just totally gripped into the story for two hours has experienced this - getting "sucked in" to the event.  Hyperfocus, however, is a bit more extreme, to the point where it goes on longer than necessary & where you get really, really overly focused on whatever you're doing.  And unfortunately, it's usually either avoidance behavior, or a less-important priority, rather than what's hot right now, i.e. the stuff you should *really* be focusing on.

Probably all of us with ADHD have experienced beneficial hyperfocus at some point as well (usually as a result of ignoring something else, haha).  Have you ever gotten bitten by the cleaning bug?  Like, where you get into a deep-cleaning mood & spend all day (or all night) in a tizzy cleaning up your entire place.  You feel empowered, you feel productive, you're in the "flow" of things, and it's easy to stay focused.  The task itself typically doesn't matter, nor does your current energy level, because whenever that state of hyperfocus gets triggered, you get mentally sucked into it & just kind of shoot down that river without having to work at "paddling" at all.  So the question is, how do we get ourselves into that hyperfocus state at will?

To a large extent, GTD will take care of that for you, for two reasons: first, everything you want to or need to do is captured outside of your brain, so your brain is free to be empty because your brain has a trustworthy place to plant all of that information for later. With ADHD, we are a LOT more prone to mental clutter than the average bear.  That doesn't mean the spinning vortex of mental information & distractions will just magically go away, but you can push through it because you know you have a system that is taking care of all of that tracking for you - tracking what you have to do, what all of the steps are for doing it, and reminding you when to do it so that it gets done.

Second, the implementation of the execution part of GTD is basically just working off a combination of a next-actions list & a calendar.  One list that most people have is a grocery list.  So when you see that you're out of milk, you can capture it into your GTD notebook or note-taking app.  When you process that list, you'll realize it should go on a grocery list.  Then when you go shopping, you'll know exactly what you need to purchase, so you can buzz up & down every aisle, pick up what you need, and get out of the store, no problem.  You've taken the thinking out of it so that you can simply focus on the execution.

part 1/2 Share here! 😂😂 I love how relatable this is.  Here you go
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0ynr/throwaway_time_whats_your_secret_that_could/c4ixtgi Sounds like ADHD alright. That’s where I want to be, that’s where I am, but not writing what I am supposed to very often. That’s harder, a challenge, but I’ll get there. Once you have a set of interchangeable circulars and learn to do magic loop with them to avoid DPNs, then you will almost never need anything else!  part 2/2

Anyway, looping back to triggering hyperfocus, we can now start deconstructing what hyperfocus really is:

1. It's getting into the "zone" or into the flow of things.  This basically means that you're single-tasking, instead of multi-tasking.  Normal operation with ADHD is to have all of that mental clutter of alllllll the things you have to do, all of the steps required to do each of those things, trying to mentally figure out the priority of what to do because it's all screaming at you at once, and then remembering to do what you're supposed to do at the right time.  Obviously, holding that all in your brain is not the most effective strategy available.
2. On the flip side, when you get sucked into an activity, most people can just get focused as needed.  We struggle with that because we're so mentally distracted all the time, and because we have often short attention spans.  But when we do get focused, we REALLY get focused.  We get hyper-focused!  It's kind of like a pendulum - on the left side of the swinging arc, the first extreme, is total uncaring & not being able to motivate ourselves to do much of anything, even really really really simple things.  On the right side of that arc, the opposite extreme, is getting so focused to the point where we just hammer through something for hours at times, to the exclusion (or ignorance) of literally everything else.  In the middle is our typical ADHD operating mode - trying to keep all of the tasks, sub-tasks, and reminders of tasks in our head, or maybe combining that with an ineffective paper or digital tracking method(s) - 3x5" cards, notepads, sticky notes, emails to ourselves, to-do lists, etc.  Zero consistent payoff, however.
3. Typically, we hyperfocus on something we already know how to do, so there's a low barrier to entry & doing the task itself is fairly low-friction.  Like binge-watching a show on Netflix...we know how to sit on the couch, turn on the TV, and watch a show.  Or cleaning the whole house - it can be hard to get up the gumption to do the dishes when you're really fighting yourself on doing a task, but when that hyperfocus mode hits, boy oh boy, watch out!  But really, all of those cleaning tasks are pretty simple, and we already know how to clean, so getting into the zone is easy because we're not really figuring anything new out.  Or if you've ever played through a video game for 4 hours straight, same idea.
4. So the first takeaway from that is that we have to know what we want to do, like, we have a term paper due tomorrow, but we're not clear on what's required & it feels like an overwhelming amount of work & dang, your apartment is a wreck so I better just get started cleaning up a bit and wow, it's midnight now and this place looks amazing!  But oh crap, you didn't work on your paper!  Haha.  So there's a pressure-driven trigger to do avoidance work, which kicks off that super-motivating feeling that gets us into hyperfocus mode.  But what if we didn't need that type of trigger?
5. So one of the ways our minds work is through motivation to action via thinking.  When you sit down & think through the process of what is this?  What outcome do I want?  What's the very next physical action required?  Then all of a sudden your brain is like HEY I CAN TOTALLY DO THIS!  Because you've vaporized that mental mountain & have an actionable task you can physically DO, which is exactly how your brain is wired to operate & respond to!  This is what make GTD so powerful...you completely shift off being a disorganized mess by nailing down & separating out each of the processes required to be productive.  What that translates to is shifting your entire life to simply working off a very highly-motivating list of next-actions.  I don't mean emotionally motivating, I mean that motivating in terms of allowing that mousetrap in your brain to spring into action & snap down on that task, because you've removed that haze of "ugh, I don't wanna do this" by clearly defining it & then figuring out what you actually have to DO about it, and that's where your brain excels at pushing you into doing something.
6. So GTD lets you (1) offload all the stuff in your brain, and (2) gives you a list of next-actions to work on.  Without that haze, and then coupled with a very clear, single next action to work on, it's like funneling your brain straight into hyperfocus mode every single time, WITHOUT requiring the pressure of avoiding doing something else, or the pressure of last-minute panic, or whatever is driving you into hyperfocus mode otherwise.
7. Now...imagine living like this.  All day, every day.  Being clear, mentally, all day.  Again, you'll still have ADHD-brain, but because you have all of the stuff captured into your GTD system, it's not pressing on your brain like it was before.  And then having a clarified list of next-actions.  Complete game-changer because it no longer becomes a question of what to do or forgetting or not knowing or having too much mental load & feeling that pressure all the time.
8. I couple that with the plugins I mentioned earlier so that it's easy to start doing something & easy to keep doing something.  Starting to do something requires a clear next-action, which kicks off that mental mousetrap reaction. And to stick with it & keep on doing it, it helps to have a procedure in place so that you know what you're doing.  That's why it's so easy to clean or binge-watch shows or play video games or play on reddit for hours & hours - it's easy to get started because we know what the next-action required is to get started, and it's easy to stick with it because we've done it before & know the procedure.  I've found that procedures are crucial for recurring success, because you need to kind of follow a script or a checklist to ensure success, whether you're making a grilled cheese sandwich (and not ending up with cereal) or playing NBA (and not kicking the basketball like a soccer ball).

So yeah, I went from being unwantingly controlled by hyperfocus before, to the point where I'd "wake up" from my flow-state and be like ah crap, I just wasted all of this time & stayed up late doing stuff that totally isn't relevant to what I really wanted to accomplish, to being able to hop into hyperfocus mode whenever I want.  And it doesn't require a big push or willpower or having to try really hard, it's all kind of 'mechanical' - there are rules & systems available to help you, and you already have a brain that is ready to hop into action, you just have to put the right systems into place to help you do what you really want to do.  I spent my whole life not understanding that & not having the resources to dig myself out of my ADHD hole because I just didn't have a concrete path forward.

Anyway, HTH.  I know reading a wall of text is a pain with ADHD, but it's not rocket science - you're just missing a good system in your life, which is just a bag of the right tricks, which mostly just boils down to some checklists to follow & some tools to setup.  I just hyperfocused on writing this pot & pumped it out in 20 minutes or so because I utilized exactly what I wrote out above: my brain has been freed from to-do storage thanks to GTD, I knew what my goal was (explain how to activate hyperfocus at-will), I knew what the procedure was (write stuff down), and I knew the next-action was to click Reply and start typing.  Then I got caught up in the flow & wrote everything down & here we are! https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/8snxw3/hyperfocus_blessing_and_a_curse/e11ticy

https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/8snxw3/hyperfocus_blessing_and_a_curse/e11tj07 College was rough. I’ve been blessed with great parents who supported and empowered me. Even so. I paid someone else almost 200 grand to work for them 16 hours a day 7 days a week for 3 years to get my BA. Oh man I wish this wasn't so long because I want to read it but when I start I basically just skim over shit and then get lost :( Thanks for sharing your system :)

I recorded your comments so they'd be easier to "read" :)

Here is my tldr attempt: **Get tasks out of your head and into a "trusted system" a.s.a.p. Make sure you know what to do next at all times.**

GTD (David Allen's "Getting Things Done" -- [here's a nice flowchart](https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf) -- is probably the best way we know to do this.

The whole system is probably overkill for the average person, but here's (in his own words) the two questions you should ask yourself about every "project" (task with multiple steps):

* **Write down all your projects (project = any task with more than one step)**

* **For each project, write down**

1. **What's the desired outcome**

2. **What is the Next Action?**

If you'd like to go more in depth, the GTD book is excellent, and there's even an [Audiobook!](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Getting-Things-Done/David-Allen/9781508215547) available. 

I also recommend Getting Things Done Fast, which is a recording of his workshop.

 Sounds like GTD is a key component in freeing up mental energy that you can use to get into your flow. Can you elaborate on what GTD looks like in practice, or provide resources on how to learn to use it? Holy shit that was such an awesome explanation!!! I’ve heard of GTD before but the way it’s always been explained made me sort of roll my eyes like, no way that will work with ADHD. I’ve actually sort of organically started doing some of this on my own, which has really worked for me but I’m still having some roadblocks with certain things. 

So 2 questions for you:
1) what is your GTD system? I’ve found that a notebook or planner works the best for me because I like to physically write things down and see them on paper, but then I miss out on the awesome features of technology so I usually supplement with reminders and a todo list app on my phone. Mostly this works but I still struggle. 
2) how do you prioritize your tasks when you have a LOT of important things that need to get done (preferably yesterday)? Such a simple thing but lately this has been my biggest struggle.  Fear not! I have produced an audio version for you: [hyperfocus](http://m.andai.tv/ytdl/hyperfocus.mp3)

 What you're missing is an effective reading strategy.  Try this:

1. Print out both posts
2. Write a number on the right of each paragraph (1,2,3,4,5, etc.) & cut each paragraph out with scissors
3. Read just one paragraph at a time

You don't have the attention span to process that much information visually at once.  That simply means that sitting down & reading in one block is not an effective strategy for you, so you need a more effective strategy.  Think of this method as training wheels.  Your job is to download the information in those two posts into your head so you can see what I'm talking about & mull it over. Good job, very nice!

I would add that there are endless lists of feel-good ideas out there on the Internet, including for GTD.  For example, asking what the desired outcome & next action for a project is great, but is essentially useless long-term without the rest of the system in-place in your life.  GTD basically has to be a 100&#37; implementation to be 100&#37; effective.  This is a pretty big barrier to someone who struggles with ADHD because it is somewhat complex to setup initially:

1. You have to read the book & learn the system
2. You have to setup your toolkit
3. You have to set aside a couple of days to capture everything in your life
4. You have to institute some new habits & learn how to use your next-actions list instead of relying on your brain to remind you when to do stuff

It's basically a complete culture change for someone who suffers from ADHD.  It's not hard, but it is new, and new is hard, haha.  If you have someone patient in your life, I would recommend asking them to help babysit you through the process so that you start it, stick with it, and complete it.  Once you get going, it's dirt-simple to maintain.  You'll never want to go back to your old way of doing things because life is just so much less stressful using the GTD methodology.

GTD is the magic bullet for managing ADHD, imo. The most important aspect of GTD are??? You cut off... Yup.  Book is available for $12 here or used for a few dollars:

[https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/)

I personally don't recommend the audiobook (unless you learn well audibly...I don't, I drift off SUPER easily) because it is a lot of dense & wordy information.

I do recommend skimming it & making a mind-map for each section.  Do the whole book that way.  It takes a few passes to start getting an understanding of how it works.  It's simply a reflection of how life works, which is what makes it so powerful - you choose how you want to implement it, but there's an underlying workflow that is key to proper operation.  Basically 3 keys:

1. Write down anything you've gotta do
2. At least daily, convert those from to-do's to next-actions (there's a flowchart for doing this)
3. Stick reminders of the next-actions on a list or calendar

It's more detailed than that, but freeing up mental energy is only part of it.  It's also partly about 100&#37; tracking all of the junk you're on the hook for & NEVER dropping the ball or "forgetting" anything.  It's partly about vaporizing those mental mountains we face that create emotional barriers to doing things - that aversion you feel to taking action, which slides us into avoidance behavior.

It's surprisingly simple to operate, once you get the "machine" going.  I compare it to surfing at the ocean: the wave of life keeps knocking us down with to-do's.  Learning how to surf takes some practice, but then, anytime you want to, you can hop on a wave & just skim the surface, easily managing the water instead of being overwhelmed by it.  GTD handles the management of life's work so that you can focus on the execution of it & actually be motivated to do stuff, instead of feeling like you have to try really hard at everything all day long all the time, lol. Also, yeah, GTD is kind of mis-advertised on the web.  I view GTD simply as a reflect of life's requirements.  David Allen really does have the whole thing figured out, in terms of how to effectively stay on top of things & get things done.  Like:

1. You have crap you gotta do.  Work, school, hobbies, etc.  Stuff you need to do, want to do, should do, might do, etc.
2. So you need a way to capture that, and it has to be with you 24/7 so that whenever an idea pops into your head or somebody puts you on the hook for something, you snag it.  And you snag it off your brain.  Now your brain doesn't have to remember it anymore!
3. That information is useless without figuring out what to do about it, which is where the GTD flowchart checklist comes in.  The short version is: what is it?  What's the outcome desired?  What's the very next physical action required to make progress on it?  So you first capture the breadth or the horizontal aspect of life - all the stuff you have to do - and then you dive deep & capture the vertical depth of each step that needs to be done.  Most of us do both of those in our brain, which puts us on 24/7 overload!
4. Once you know what the next-actions are, you put it on an appropriate list or your calendar.  The core list is the next-actions list.  But you can make custom lists for everything.  How about a grocery list of stuff to buy at the store?   You look in the fridge, you're almost out of milk, you capture milk.  When you process your list of captured items (at least once a day by the end of the day, although most people do it multiple times a day to really stay current & on top of things - like if you realize you're out of milk in the morning, capture it, go to the grocery store after work but don't buy milk, and then process your list before bed, then you've missed the point lol).  And your calendar is good for stuff like going to a dentist appointment next Wednesday at 9am.  Then you can put those together & kind of figure out your plan for the day.  I use a lot of contextual lists...stuff to do before work, stuff to do on my commute, on break, at lunch, after work, during free time, before bed, etc.  Like if I'm bored, I have a list of games I want to play on Steam or movies I've been meaning to watch on Netflix.
5. You can get things as defined (or not) as you want.  Like for some projects, you just need that initial next-action to get you into the zone & into that workflow of working on something.  If you're writing a book in your free time, then your next-action could be "write 5 pages today".  Or you could say "write for 30 minutes".  Just depends on the activity in question.  For cleaning my living room, I follow a checklist instead of a specific amount of time.  So I first put away any trash in the trash can, then any laundry in the hamper (i.e. socks on the floor), then any dishes in the sink (snack tray by the couch), then "return to home" (put the Legos back in the Lego bin), then anything else goes in a lost & found bucket, then I vacuum (yay Roomba!).  So that's a procedural type of activity, and my trigger for doing that is after I get home from work, I've got a contextual next-actions list for "after work" and "clean living room per procedure" is on there.  Then I just buzz through my checklist & voila, my living room stays clean on a daily basis!  I can't clean the whole living room, too hard - but I can break it down into chunks & start by picking up just the trash & throwing it away, you know?
6. Now imagine living your whole life off lists of clearly-defined next-actions.  You could easily get your work done.  You could easily make progress on personal projects.  Your free time, where you don't need to apply GTD, would actually be free of guilt & avoidance behavior, because you're 100&#37; on top of your stuff & haven't dropped the ball or forgotten anything, so that nagging pressure is totally gone & you can truly enjoy doing nothing.  That way you can binge-watch a show because you want to, not because that term paper is due on Friday, haha!

So GTD is simply a workflow that responds to how life works.  How you implement it is up to you.  But if you don't capture stuff, then you'll forget & drop the ball on them.  If you don't process what you capture, then it will remain a vague un-doable to-do instead of a nice crispy, clear next-action item that you can actually DO.  If you don't put reminders into your system, then you'll forget to do things sometime, because your brain has no alarm clock or calendar built-in.  And if you try to mentally remember all of the stuff you have to do, and all of the tasks you need to do for each activity, and then try to remember to do each of those, and also try to mentally prioritize all of those, you're going to be walking around on overload all the time!

With ADHD, we get distracted easily (unless we're in hyperfocus mode!).  Most of us are so tired we don't even know we're tired because we have sleeping problems (aka we get distracted & stay up late, lol).  Most of us carry all of the crap above around in our head, instead of letting an external system manage it.  So most of us are really tired & stressed out & don't know how to escape.  GTD is like the yellow brick road for ADHD, lol. Sure.  GTD system-wise:

1. I use the Todoist app on my phone.
2. I capture into Todoist & then usually process using the Todoist webpage at my computer, when I can sit down & run through the GTD checklist for each captured item.
3. At work, I do use a paper notebook because I can scribble out notes really fast.  I work as an IT admin with various customers & it's just easier to keep my work GTD separate from my personal GTD system.
4. The rest of my GTD system lives in Google Drive.  I break it down into Projects, Programs, Systems, and Reference.  Projects are multi-step tasks.  Programs are multi-project tasks (ex. "finish college" = a whole bunch of individual classes as "projects").  Systems are recurring items I have to deal with (budget, menu, house chores, laundry, etc.)  Reference is just information I want to keep, like a PDF manual for a kitchen appliance.
5. I use Google Calendar for calendar reminders, and then the built-in iPhone app for reminders throughout the day (based on the day).
6. That's about it.  I capture into Todoist (or into a paper notebook at work), I process at minimum by the end of the day (the whole "inbox zero" thing), and then I work off a combination of my next-actions list (work list, home list, grocery list, etc.) & calendar. Pretty simple.

Priority-wise:

1. Only you can prevent forest fires.  I mean, only you can define what's hot & what's important & what needs to get done.  It helps, tremendously, to have that off your brain & written down, so that you're shuffling physical cards instead of mental ones.  GTD is all about off-brain storage, haha.
2. I create what I call a Power Routine for myself.  I'm an adult with a family & a job, so my weekdays are spent at work & my weekends are free.  We all have the same 168 hours in a week & 24 hours in a day, so defining how your typical routine goes is a good place to start because then you can plan around that.  You may have to work 8 hours a day, but you also get a lunchbreak, which is when you can study something or make calls or do whatever.  There's before-work and after-work periods of time.  After work, you have to do your chores & stuff, then you have free time, then it's time for your bedtime routine.  So we all have a limited amount of time.  Even if you don't work & don't have a job & don't have kids, you still have to sleep & eat & get dressed & whatever, so you don't really have a full 24 hours, or after 8 hours of sleep, you don't really even have a full 16 yours, you might only have 13 hours after breakfast, lunch, dinner, showering, chores, etc.
3. It's important to understand your routine in order to understand that (1) everything takes time to do, and (2) you can really only get good at stuff & finish stuff when you single-task on stuff.  Multi-tasking is a great way to scatter your focus, haha.  GTD not only helps you to single-task, but also blow away all of those other distractions in your mind because your system is holding them offline, off your brain, so that you can really focus on that one task that you're working on.
4. A large part of why that's important is that people with ADHD are largely overly-optimistic about what they can get done in a given day or period of time.  Basically we all lie to ourselves about what we can really do & how long things will really take.  Sometimes it takes time to think about stuff, or work on a problem, or study a piece of information for school, or your run into a weird problem that you have to fix, or whatever.  And sometimes we struggle with not wanting to do something (an aversion to the task, for whatever reason) & don't have much energy left at the end of the day to do whatever it is you need to get done.
5. All of that is important to understand because ADHD's MO is firefighting.  We're constantly behind, constantly late, and are lacking in a procedure to follow, so it's hard to get started & stick with what we need to get done.  I've been in both camps, myself - struggling for the life of me, and staying on top of things easily & effortlessly.  The whole point of GTD is as the tagline says - "stress-free productivity".  Once you get the hang of GTD & block our your routine on a calendar & really start seeing what available free time you have, and then sticking your next-actions on there, you'll realize you can only do so much in a day, even if you have 100&#37; effective focus & high-energy...the time ticks on & stuff takes time & then time runs out.  And you need to balance work with personal endeavors with play.

That's why I say GTD is simple to operate, but a LOT to take in at once.  It's not rocket science, but understanding what's out there & how things work & getting into the swing of things takes time & effort.  If you can have someone non-ADHD help babysit you along the way, to the point where you understand the whole thing, have your system setup, go through that initial collection phase, and become operational and go "live", then it's pretty easy to both stick with it & to get back into it if you fall off the wagon (which happens! and which is fine, because once it's all setup & you know how to use it, it's simply to jump back into it...and sometimes that happens because you get sick or go on vacation or just get lazy or whatever). *noice* Bonus post:  You're not dumb or limited, you just require a different approach, that's all.  You already know you can learn stuff - you're smart enough to learn English, be able to write, know how to navigate the Internet, and are fluent enough in technology to be able to post to reddit.  You simply are unable to use the neuro-typical approach of sitting down & reading a large section of information at once without being distracted to the point where you feel an aversion to doing it.  That's one out of like 400 strategies for getting information into your brain.  No big deal.

Try the method above.  Slow down your need to acquire information instantly.  Set a timer on your phone and read one paragraph every 10 minute for the rest of the day.  Take that slow approach, and only bite off one paragraph of information at a time.  Then it's like shooting fish in a barrel!  Think of it as doing pushups...you can just get down & whip out 200 pushups in one sitting, you have to build up to it over the course of many months.  Eventually you can internalize this method, or another method like this, and be able to have a more effective approach for sitting down & reading through a wall of text much more easily.

I say that, and yet if you ask an ADHD person about reading Harry Potter, they've usually hyperfocused on it & read through the whole thing in no time, haha.  So it's partly about interest (hyperfocusing) & partly about having an approach that works for you, in terms of how to get the written data into your head.  Which can be splitting it up into chunks, increasing the font size, reading it out loud & recording it via a voice memo app on your smart phone & listening to it again, skimming & making a mind-map of the data, etc.  Lots of different approaches are available! Oh sorry, botched edit. I moved the most important parts up and made them bold :) That sounds excellent. The philosophy of getting all the details out of your head and captured in an external symptom isn't new to me. My problem historically has been finding a system that is easy enough to use that I will actually use it. If the mental energy required to transfer details into the system is equal to or greater than the stress it relieves, then I'm fucked because I won't use said system.

I just ordered the book from Amazon. All this is extra relevant because I just landed my first real job yesterday, and it's an admin assistant role that will absolutely destroy me unless I can stay organized. I'm sure that I'm capable of this, but it's certainly not playing to my strengths. This is amazingly helpful, thank you!! You could do a TED talk lol

I’m definitely going to try and implement this, especially since my system is already sort of halfway there, just needs to be tweaked.
