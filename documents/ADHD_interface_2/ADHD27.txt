Effort to comprehend reading So I have always wondered if this was due to to ADHD or not, but when reading many things it's difficult to process what I'm actually reading. I can easily pronounce the words and know what they mean but I can't process what they are talking about. A great deal of effort has to be put in for me to be able to comprehend what is being said.  Does anyone else have this issue and does ADHD medication help with it? Audiobooks have been a huge help after medication  Reading is a skill and it’s one that a lot of people have grown rusty in recently. I’m a fairly heavy reader and go through probably two books a week, but it took me a few years to get to that point. You kinda have to get used to sitting down for longer periods of time and staying focused (I had to do something like 15 mins at a time using Pomodoro timers). As you get used to it and read more and more, the more you can comprehend, the faster you’ll get, and the more challenging stuff you’re able to read. 

I can read most non-fiction quite quickly with my eyes just scanning multiple word chunks at a time (rather than sounding out each word in my head) with good retention. However, give me a classic from the 1800s with dated language and my reading speed is much slower, I barely comprehend it, and I can’t sit down for very long, because I haven’t built up that skill yet. Read something that is easy enough that you’ll be able to build the habit, but also try to challenge yourself a bit. Kindles are great because you can highlight words and see the definition which helps if your vocabulary isn’t as robust early on. 

Meds help big time, IMO. I still had to build the skill while on my meds, but meds certainly made things easier. My reading speed, attentiveness, and retention are all improved. I also have much more of an appetite for reading.
