Went to bed at 11:30 PM convinced I was exhausted, then watched TV and played on my phone. It is now 3:15 AM and I just got out of bed filled with the insurmountable urge to put laundry away. Never actually slept and don't know if/when I will. Never mind that I had a whole day to do this but didn't want to because that would have cut in to my precious free time, so instead I've apparently decided to cut in to my less-important sleep time.  As always.  üëç

Edited for grammar.  I feel this. 
I have literally been standing in my bathroom for like 20 minutes just on my phone - I came in here to get ready for bed because I was exhausted............... At night is always when my brain really ramps up. Hey! It‚Äôs 4:30 am where I am! Haven‚Äôt gone to bed yet either! Please kill me. The issue there is that you turned on the TV. Artificial light blocks your brain from increasing ~~serotonin~~ melatonin. If you also play games then you  are shooting up your brain with Adrenalin and stress hormones. This is not ADHD it‚Äôs just incompatibility between lifestyle and biology I've had to ban my phone from my own bedroom. It gets charged in the kitchen every night now. The withdrawals were tough, but on a positive note, my insomnia is almost gone and I've been sleeping better than ever! Went to my room to get my towel and clothes to shower at 11, decided to check emails, ended up clearing and reorganizing emails, passwords, files then proceeded to move onto every corner of room... including all my clothes/laundry. It's now 4am and I have to get ready for work in 3 or 4 hours.
Plus side is everything is organized........ had a similar night today, i don't know wether I'm tired or exhausted. everything is too loud or too bright, i filled the sink with icecubes and water then i put my face in it, but it only helps for the moment, i have to go to a trip tommorow so i can't sleep trough the day and do it again, 

i feel so deranged. I get you, it's been really helpful to me, to take a shower before bed, turn off all the lights and read a book,(you can install some blue light blocking app or even some phone all ready have that function) for at least 10 minutes, almost Everytime Im to tired and it's to much of hassle to stand up that I just go for it and sleep instead, It works like 80% of the times. When it dosent the next day I feel so tired that I'm always think "is really worth it to stay up so late?" The answer is no, cause sleep is like so important for out health and devolcempt that we can't just fuck with it. Hope that helps. You *cannot* have your phone in your bedroom with you when you go to bed, I'm sorry.  Yeah the TV and phone was a bad idea. That stuff keeps you up.  I literally laid in bed for an hour decided I needed to shave because it was annoying me, went back to bed, maybe got 20 minute cat nap, woke up wide awake tried to go back to sleep for another 1.5 hours got out of bed, got breakfast, am eating it now and reading Reddit wide awake :( Wow didn't know that this was related to ADHD too. This explains so much. You gotta take the TV and anything else out of your room. Your bedroom should be for sleeping only, no TV, Computer, work desk, etc. Make a point to only sleep in your room, nothing else (besides getting dressed if that‚Äôs where your clothes are), that way you will only associate that room with sleep. 
Maybe also try and set a bed time alarm and then stop using electronics for an hour or half hour until you go to bed. It‚Äôll keep you reminded that you need to start winding down and help remove your brain from stimulating things like phone/TV.  Everyone here needs [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com) for their computers and [twilight ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en_US)for their android phones  I always try and give in to those cleaning urges cuz they come so rarely. Every time I think about cleaning or putting my laundry away, I think of all the small fiddly things scattered around my room that I would have to pick up and organize, and just give up.

Meaning: Pens/coins/cables/tools/books/papers/etc covering every available surfac in my room D: cmon, put that phone away before bed, it‚Äôs one of the top reasons people don‚Äôt sleep well I can't tell you how many times I've done groceries or laundry or other chores at 330/4am because I've given up on sleep Not sure if it works for you but David Attenborough's documentaries make me fall asleep in minutes. Takes me over a week to watch a single episode. I do watch on a laptop with brightness turned lowest maybe that makes a difference. I‚Äôm totally guilty of this every now and then. As a golden standard (which I‚Äôve found to be really helpful) and as cliche as it sounds, I try to severely limit my time with electronics that have screens. This normally helps me slow down...eventually. I‚Äôm on a reading challenge right now where I try to read a book every month (which is definitely difficult for us...or at least me) and this is a game-changer. I‚Äôm down for the count in 5 mins or less. Together, these two habits have really helped me wake up with a clearer head and focus to the day. I also religiously use ‚ÄúSleepy time‚Äù (first link on Google...sorry can‚Äôt post direct link because phone is acting up) which has made a significant difference in whether I wake up feeling groggy or alert.

Have you all tried any of these tactics? Love to hear your thoughts! Everyone is different.  I‚Äôm just trying to help.  I rarely sleep like any normal person would. I have Fibromyalgia and RLS.  The meds made me crazy so I have to try other ways to help me. I also work rotating shifts as a nurse so once my body would get used to the cycle it would change. I‚Äôve been to several specialists and besides meds, they all said  this.  Stick to a routine. Anxiety is a problem for me when I try and relax. My mind races with what didn‚Äôt get done and what has to get done. So I make lists and journal before bed. Have to limit yourself to 10-minutes or so otherwise may exacerbate your anxiety. No tv or phone or any electronics in your bedroom. No electronics 30 minutes to 1 hour before bedtime.  And bedroom kept at 65 or cooler.  And don‚Äôt just lay in bed. If you try and sleep and you can‚Äôt for more than 15 minutes or so-get up and go sit in a chair and read.  Try and get in 20 minutes or more of exercise a day.  But not too close to your bedtime.  Bed is for sleep and sex only.  Don‚Äôt lay in bed playing video games or watching tv. Need to train your body and stick to a routine. Good luck!  Not too related to your post, but your title actually reminded me to change the laundry from washer to dryer. Thanks. I bet anything I would've forgot for the entire day. XD Haha i just played games... beats me. Yep. Woke up at 3:30 am and laid in bed until 4:30 am. I got up and put away dishes, washed a load of laundry, and then went to Walmart for soap. Lol. It happens. Every. Damn. Night. You‚Äôre not alone.  Feel this!! It really helped me to come up with a cue that consistently means bedtime. For me, that's putting on my good headphones with an ASMR video and I'm out. Hey you are me and I‚Äôm you. This is my issue all the time, I‚Äôll climb in bed exhausted and watch some tv. Eventually turn it off to lay in the dark and hope to fall asleep. An hour will pass and I‚Äôll get frustrated and bored of doing nothing while trying to sleep, so I‚Äôll turn the tv back on. Eventually turn it off and repeat that process until the whole sleep thing finally works.
I think the max amount of sleep I can ever get is about 5 hours, but on average it‚Äôs closer to 3-4 hours a night, even on nights where I don‚Äôt need to set an alarm to be up at a specific time the next day. My body naturally wakes me up after that little amount since it‚Äôs used to it. Try meditating before you go to bed then immediately get in bed without looking at your phone/tv/laptop. You‚Äôll be surprised at how tired you actually are and will fall asleep within 5 minutes.  Plug your phone in away from the bed. Remove the TV from your room. This is so me. I feel better reading this. Thanks! Sounds like a red flag for bipolar. Sounds very much like a manic phase. I would mention this instance to your clinician when next you speak.

19% of adults with ADHD have bipolar, and nearly 70% with bipolar have ADHD. I, personally, have BPD2

Source: national comordbidity survey  This, i really wanna sleep but can't and its 3am and i had to wake up at 7am. Hate it.  Feels /deep, intense empathetic sobbing, because SAME Benadryl soml Flattened diurnal cortisol rhythm is expected with ADHD Dude, same. I was up until 7AM on my phone this morning. I‚Äôve been doing this for the last week, idk how to stop. I‚Äôm tired as all hell and as soon as I‚Äôm in bed I don‚Äôt feel it anymore and I want to get up and do other things.  Once a month I will not sleep one night and just stay up doing crap and I never crash from it the in the following days. Just use the time. I've slept in this entire weekend and have been telling myself it's perfectly fine. But I'm not looking forward to tomorrow and trying to get back on my regular sleep schedule.  Are you in the northern hemisphere?  It's midsummer, which always makes me more lively.  The night is so short I feel like I'm going to bed super early even at 1am.  I find it usually passes around 2-3 weeks from now.  

I highly recommend turning your phone off an hour before you plan to go to bed.  Don't ever take it into the bedroom with you; get a normal alarm clock or put it outside your bedroom door so you have to get up for the alarm.  ADHD and tiredness keeps us scrolling and clicking long after we should have switched off. I don't even want to think about how many HOURS I've wasted sitting on the toilet after a quick wee because I got distracted by revising my entire app drawer or ended up fifty clicks deep in a Wikipedia hole...  I'm so glad other people do this too. Standing up in the bathroom at 4:00 has been very dangerous for me!  I tend to finally fall asleep while looking at my phone while standing and fall over usually  my head or another sensitive part.  But if I take ambien etc I sleep.walk and that.can be even worse.  Ugh. The other day I purposefully left my phone in another room while I went to my room to get dressed so that I wouldn't get distracted, and then I sat half naked for 20 minutes distracted by playing with my nails which I just had done.  "I'm sooooo exhausted"

\*lies down\*

\*brain kicks into hyperdrive\*

WHHHHHYYYYYYY Benadryl Yep, take the tv out of the bedroom, charge your phone out of reach. Bed is for sleeping and sex. That‚Äôs it.  i think you mean melatonin, not serotonin. the problem isn't artificial light, necessarily, but white light, since we're kinda programmed to respond to the day/night cycle and without a reduction in white light people can tend not to feel sleepy (this is a function of melatonin, and white light decreases the amount released). i heard filtering the light and making them red helps with this. stimulating media can obviously be a huge problem, too.  ADHD exacerbates this when you easily get distracted from getting ready for bed and also have trouble shifting from your games/shows/reading/internet to sleeping.

It gets me almost every night. I **know** I shouldn‚Äôt even start the activity, but my tired brain justifies 5 minutes. That turns into hours of, ‚Äújust one more link, then I‚Äôll get off.‚Äù It‚Äôs usually an hours-long internal argument where I constantly know I want to get off and try to sleep, and constantly argue, ‚Äújust one more...‚Äù. The argument that doesn‚Äôt involve shifting activities is the path of least resistance.

Timers and alarms will sometimes sufficiently jar me into shifting. Resisting the urge to start in the first place is ideal, but all my willpower is spent by the end of the day. I know that‚Äôs what they say but then why am I struggling to stay awake during a movie, like really fighting to keep my eyes open but the minute I go to bed I can‚Äôt sleep.  YMMV.  I followed a strict sleep hygiene routine for years and always had issues falling asleep.  About a year ago I started falling asleep to Netflix shows I had already binged on...I sleep great now.  Fall asleep within 20 minutes.  I got one of those tv power bars that shuts everything off after the remote hasn‚Äôt been used in a while so the tv doesn‚Äôt wake me up in the middle of the night...best sleep ever.  I need something to listen to so my brain doesn‚Äôt start thinking about things that I need to act on.   Eh this is downplaying it for a lot of people. I don't have a TV in my room, use only lights or screens without any blue/white light, and only read or study before bed where I only use it to sleep or have sex. Unfortunately I'm the most clear headed, even when taking meds, between 10pm-3am. Clear headed and not tired a bit even after trying melatonin.  Plus when you wake up in the morning you have a reason to get out of bed! This is me every time something I decide to do can start with the phrase, "oh, I'll just take care of this real quick..."  Pretty much the only cleaning I do is done at night.  Oh! I read somewhere that a change in our bodies temperature can trigger sleep.  That‚Äôs why taking a bath for a lot of people helps them fall asleep...I find that works for me in the winter, but in the summer...I‚Äôm already warm...more warm isn‚Äôt helpful.  So I bring ice packs to bed lol.  I place them around my body to cool me, and it helps trigger that temperature change.  I forgot about it until you mentioned the ice sink face bath.  

It might help some people on here....I‚Äôm going to dig my ice packs out of the bottom of the freezer for tonight.   It‚Äôs such good advice, my only issue is that when I put my electronics to the side I just lay in the dark and eventually get so bored and frustrated that I can‚Äôt fall asleep that I‚Äôll seek them out again. You can if you prevent yourself from using it in any counterproductive ways. Though if you can afford to, you can replace the needs the phone fills with unitasker tools. Like a red-colored projector clock aimed at the ceiling or wall, and maybe some noise generator/playing machines if you need specific noises, and so on. No electronics/noises/lights in the bedroom is ideal, but sometimes that just bites us in the ass thanks to the ADHD. It's really unnerving sometimes when you discover or are reminded of how many traits or behaviors you thought were merely random quirks of yours is in actuality common (though not universal) ADHD behaviors or coping strategies... Though allegedly iOS and Android have native settings for that these days! f.lux is one of the first things I install/reinstall on a computer. Is he really that boring? üòÇ Egg timers, or if you have a smartphone always on you then labelled timers, are pretty great. HE-YO! Bipolar/ADHD squad checking in. Hydroxyzine might also be worth a shot. im a college student who cant get himself to get his studying done during normal hours. I used to not sleep for an entire night once a week just to make up for the work I missed when I was procrastinating prior to that. It destroyed my sleep schedule and my mental health but it was the only thing I could do Fifty?

Hah! Amateur! its not fair how relatable this is lmao Zopiclone you rookie. LOL. What's it like to be able to take benadryl & not be sent into a bout of Ventricular Tachycardia? It sounds wonderful tbh. I'm working on sticking to this now. In principle I agree with you, but in practice I really like ruining my sleep. Thanks for the correction. Actually serotonin is super-important for sleep but as you say I got it mixed up with melatonin (which is regulated by light exposure).  That happens to me too. I‚Äôm trying to work on my sleep hygiene lately to help (no screen time, bedtime routine, not using bed for non sleep activities). Some of it is ADHD but some of it is also just bad habits related to sleeping. Routines help but ya know those are hard with ADHD. Sigh.  I find reading a book sends me to sleep  Have you tried developing a sleep routine? You could also just lie there with your eyes closed. If you know you won't let yourself get up, you will fall asleep eventually. I know what you mean but that's because it takes time for the brain to build up to sleep mode and that is regulated by your exposure to light. Modern screens suppress this mechanism and so it's normal that you can't fall asleep right after watching TV. Your brain incorrectly thinks that it's been exposed to daylight. Evolution just hasn't caught up us Oh thank goodness, I was getting so discouraged by all the people in here coming down on me for using my phone/watching TV.  If I don't do those things before bed and fall asleep to them, my incredibly anxious brain starts running through all of the things it worries about and I can't calm down and will sometimes work myself into a full blown panic attack.  

This particular issue was definitely brought on by my mind's inability to motivate itself at proper times for things like this, and not so much by me "keeping myself awake" with electronics and stimulation.  I feel like you should look into Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder/Syndrome. 

I‚Äôm the same way, I even put a couch in my room so I‚Äôd have a place to sit that isn‚Äôt my bed that would encourage my brain to settle down but I still can‚Äôt sleep for shit. I can sleep great when the sun comes up though. :-/  what i was talking about is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_reflex
it makes your heartbeat slow down, and your pancreas produces more red blood cells, and some other stuff, it's like your brain thinks you'll never breath air again


but what you say is also true. Or just put the phone far enough away that you can't use it while laying in bed If you're talking about a blue light filter I can confirm that android has settings for that, as I am currently using it!  I'd say soothing. But nature documentaries without him work too. Eszopiclone, you plebeian. May as well only use the active stereoisomer. Tastes so nasty I don‚Äôt eat for three days afterwards  If pahobee had that, he probably would have used it by now.  OMG IM GLAD SOMEONE ELSE GETS THAT It feels hungover. Honestly, Xanax is better for very occasional insomnia. Been doing this for two years now and my sleep is SO much healthier.  I still stay up too late, but once I'm in bed I can switch off in a way that I couldn't before. I second this. Pull out a book or get a kindle. It will put you to sleep in 15 minutes usually and you develop the habit of reading actual books, which is great in itself. I had the problem op had but because I started reading a book. Meh I tried that for FOUR hours one night before I just gave up & cleaned the kitchen and made breakfast for everyone. THEN I was ready to sleep (gah!). 

Sometimes I just force myself to go to bed really early (7 or 8) after taking a Benadryl + melatonin. I can usually break out of the staying up until 3 or 4a habit for a while.  If you lay in bed eyes closed for 15 minutes and can't sleep, get up, go into another room, and read the most uninteresting book possible. Once you feel tired again, try to sleep. Repeat this until you finally fall asleep. Source: every sleep doctor I've had.  I get anxiety at night too. :( The tv distracts me enough that I don‚Äôt spiral into stressful thoughts...and that allows me to sleep.  When I‚Äôm just laying there...so many thoughts! I tried reading before bed, but I always fall asleep propped up with the light on....so I wake up a few hours later sore and unable to fall back asleep.  The tv is the only thing that works for me.  

You have to do what works for you.  Just make sure you put on something you‚Äôve seen before...otherwise...idk about you, but I have to see what happens lol.  

 Just use filters for your phone/tv. There are third party apps and sometimes native settings in iOS and Android for smart phones that will let you minimize/eliminate blue light.  
As for your TV, you might want to either just making a preset color profile if possible for the evenings, or if you don't have that feature then adjust the colors in the evening to reduce contrast and blue hues as much as possible. ..And if you can make sure you get as much bright white in the morning.  
  
Your mileage can vary though, and you might actually benefit from a bit of blue colored light an hour or a few before sleep. But, *on average*, ADHD people *usually* benefit from lots and lots of **bright "cold" light in the mornings**, and very **"warm" gentle light in the evening**.  
  
There is nothing wrong with needing some mental distraction to fall asleep! Some nights I can't fall asleep at all unless I manage to get a sense of "completion" (I can't think of a better word for it, reducing random scattered thoughts and making my brain instead have random thoughts about one specific thing instead), and "boring" mini phone games that are mindless and either endless or  have very clear ending points (e.g. stages) can help my brain wind down. If my brain is really upset at me for being super under-stimulated reading a random short story with clear story structure usually helps me.  
Though the latter has really not happened as much since I started taking anti-anxiety medication so that's fantastic. When I was younger I used music playlists, whether shuffled or linear on loop, to manage to fall asleep. Holy shit that's exactly it. Even after doing my best to get on a normal rhythm, my body will naturally keep me up the entire night just to reset it. Doesnt seem like there's much to help it though apart from melatonin, sleep meds, and just constantly trying to relearn the schedule. Literally every single part in the definition section of wikipedia matches.  This is *really* common in people with ADHD ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt let me sleep? Ima prank you mothafucka‚Äù  Ooooo I‚Äôll have to look him up! Although I do love nature documentaries. weeeeeeeeed, it so sad it's still illegal, because i have been medicating myself with it since i was 16, it helps me with learning, appetite anxiety and sleep. but it's soooo exepnsive. Oh man you're in the club too? I'm so so sorry. I hope you're luckier then me & aren't allergy riddled. üòï (ok i could be way worse - it's not *really* bad just a few things that are highly annoying). 

I have a deadly mushroom allergy (which no one seems to take seriously, *awesome*), and the treatment is epipen, benadryl. WHEEEEEEE (and the much more minor point that since I moved back to civilization (aka Chicago) my allergic asthma decided to kick up a fuss & the inhaled steroid makes my throat super phlegmy which wouldn't be a problem if I didn't do a RADIO SHOW lolsob)

 Ah. Yeah that shit makes me pass tf out. It's great for PTSD though I've never used it for insomnia. Tbqh I joke about needing horse tranquilizers for sleep (I had a Dr Make me promise I wouldn't go to the local feed & seed and get horse tranqs...uhhh lol?) Or you knock of 600 pages before you have to get up for work. I used to use MidolPM (basically Benadryl). I've tried so many different tactics for this over the years. 3 different things consistently work for me, and I'm not exactly proud of some of them...

1. Get stoned/drunk enough to essentially turn the volume down on that unceasing inner monologue.
2. Go to sleep after physically exhausting yourself. If I do manual labor or when I used to work out a lot...this was the best sleep I could ever get.
3. It's most akin to meditation or counting sheep I supposed. I use the anxious, chattering thoughts to delve further into open-ended creative hobbies (video games, card games, writing)...and those just don't produce anxiety for me and because I'm so interested in them already, that I can usually keep my brain tuned to the right channel and on course. And no anxiety leads to sleep! f.lux is my friend <3 I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre just referring to the sleep problems or the sleep disorder. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD 13 years ago and I always attributed my sleep problems to my diagnosis but lately the sleep problems have gotten in the way of my life. When I found out about DSPD I started crying because it described the struggle of my life. Whether the ADHD is the cause or the effect, I‚Äôm not sure but getting diagnosed is my first priority when I get medical insurance. 

Last time delayed sleep phase was directly mentioned in this sub was 2014, I believe, so I was just trying to put it out there for those that really struggle with sleep. 

Edit: reposted because I replied with my throwaway üòÖ Man I live on the west coast, I forget it‚Äôs still illegal most places! Dude, if I read "before" bed I just end up slamming half a novel and getting three hours of sleep lmao.  Keep those books away from me on work nights man Oh I was referring to the DSPD/DSPS, but yeah sleep problems too. (And it was not that long ago b/c I mentioned it in a thread a week or so ago) ;)

EDIT: [Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms add risk to circadian rhythm sleep problems in depression and anxiety.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27128360) (2016 study)

>CONCLUSIONS:  
>  
>High ADHD symptoms were associated with an increased rate of circadian rhythm sleep disturbances in an already at-risk population of people with depression and/or anxiety disorders. **Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as often seen in ADHD are not entirely due to any comorbid depression and/or anxiety disorder.** Adequate treatment of such sleep problems is needed and may prevent serious health conditions in the long term.

So yeah - it's *a thing* I'm seriously considering if i should leave the country. you know how it feels to live next to the netherlands !? they are slowly moving to legalize it here but it's been in discussion for ages and our minister for substances has been quoted to say "it's illegal because its a crime." without a hint of irony.  Yooooo. "I'll just read to the end of the chapter.....well that was *only* 3 pages so one more chapter won't hurt"

2 hours later

"Well I'm almost done....."

LOL NO.  Oh, right on! Glad I‚Äôm not alone then. I had made a thread in this sub awhile back about my sleep problems and I got a lot of well-meaning suggestions + people telling me that the amount of time it takes for me to fall asleep was not normal (sigh). So finding the cause has been a huge relief, I‚Äôm sure you know what I mean.  In the field of logic they call that a circular argument üòÇ Man, tell me about it. Then I start reasoning in my head, oh, I can still get five hours of sleep here, which seems great in comparison to four, which ends up seeming great in comparison to 3, etc. And then I get three hours of sleep, feel like shit, and do it all again about a week later. 

What a life, lol  Oh definitely. Unfortunately I *also* suffer from chronic insomnia (wooo get to see a sleep psychologist in August b/c *no drugs work),* but yeah 2 sleep docs have diagnosed me with DSPD/S *also*, one prior to my ADHD diagnosis so when I found out that ADHD & DSPD have a high comorbidity rate I was like "oh please, you're kidding, right?" lolsob.

Thankfully I am in a place where I don't have to change my DSPD *\*right now\** so we'll only have to work on the chronic insomnia, which makes me very happy. My last sleep doc actually just told me not to get a job that starts before noon which is a-ok by me tbqh. i know ! it's so obvious to everyone... we got medical mj tough but its hella expensive and insurances won't cover it most of the times. my theory is they are making a lot of behind closed doors deals so only the right people can cash in once they go fully legal. it sucks because  it works so good i just want to be normal ffs. I'm just gonna move to colorado if it's gonna take any longer. like a weed refugee That‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre in a good spot right now because I know how hard it can be. Right now, I only go to school but it‚Äôs either all-nighters every day or I‚Äôm sleep deprived all week until I crash out on the weekends. 

I just started light therapy four days ago and have been using the amber glasses at night but... I didn‚Äôt fall asleep until 7am today so... haha. I know I need more time with them but they are my last resort. I‚Äôve been working for years now on accepting that my sleep schedule is different but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever love it. I love the sun and I kind of desperately want to be an early-riser. It physically pains me when people tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so lucky you can sleep late‚Äù because I‚Äôd trade with them in half a heartbeat. 

Hey, if you ever need a chat late at night, I‚Äôm here and probably awake! Lol.  Hahaha. In Oregon you are allowed a certain number of plants at home, that‚Äôs the real solution right there imo. It‚Äôs recreationally legal where I live but I can‚Äôt own plants... yet.  Yeah I hear that. My schedule has been sliding further into who TF knows category though b/c of the insomnia so I'm excited to start CBT for that.  It's like "no sleep no sleep, little sleep, sleep 2 days." :( I *used to* be "fall asleep around 2/3, wake up around 11 naturally," which is *perfect* since I too love the sun & that doesn't seem odd or unnatural to me, but this "up until 7/8/9/10" shit has got to stop. Especially because on Mondays I have a radio show at noon for which I get up at 10. (And of course there's the whole if you wake up at 2/3pm you have to cram a whole day into 2/3 hours & I *cannot* do that.) But I prefer *any* sleep to none so....

Though I'd never trade my late night self for an early morning self b/c, as I mentioned above, I do a radio show which involves quite a few interviews, concerts, etc. So late nights are my jam. (Well especially music which tends to happen late at night. xD)

Oh man that's good to know! Same! oh you can , your just not allowed to ;) 
i think most of the stuff we smoke here is already grown in the area, we're basically self sufficient already, it sounds sad but i feel like we're just waiting for the old christian conservatives to die out so we can make some progress :/ but it's also possible they will just get replaced by their children who they put into the party before they even have a concept of democracy. sigh..
