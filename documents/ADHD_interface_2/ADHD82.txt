"Maybe he has ADHD?" "No, his teacher says he's very smart." This conversation took place between the lady who was cutting my hair and her coworker whose son is struggling with behavior issues in school. Sigh. That‚Äôs literally what prevented me from getting diagnosed until I was in college. Sigh.  That's, that's not how it works Did you interject into the convo? People just think a developmental disorder = cognitive impairment.

It's why people assume that someone with ASD who is non-verbal is cognitively impaired, even though they could very likely be more intelligent than those making the assumption. Got diagnosed at 23. Before I went to bring it up with the doctor I mentioned it to my mom and she was like "yeah I always thought you probably had ADHD, since you were 4 or 5 I knew there was something off with you"

So why didn't you get me tested????

"Well you ended up doing so well in school so I figured it didn't really matter"

And that's the story of how I went undiagnosed until my last year of university üôÑ Aahhhh my parents say this about my kid!  This is exactly the reason why it took so long for me to get a diagnosis. I love learning and I‚Äôm never bored in class; with everything else that was symptomatic people just rejected the idea that it could be ADD if I did well at school! Ugh, I hate that. My oldest is 13. He‚Äôs in middle school, honors classes, currently taking some high school classes. He has ADHD. He‚Äôs smart as all get out. He just can‚Äôt organize classes, homework or assignments, forgets to turn things in, loses his stuff, easily tunes out in classes. His grades suck without constant attention but with structure, he‚Äôs one of the highest scoring kids in his entire grade. Put a test in front of him, he‚Äôll ace it. I went through college not knowing I had ADHD. I graduated magna cum laude with my Bachelors and went on to get my Masters two years later with a flawless 4.0 GPA. Then I got a career in my field as a writer. Imagine what I could have done if I was smart.  Blood set to boil now.  Me being who I am, I would have interjected and said, I have adhd, and I‚Äôm very smart, then give her a sarcastic ass smile. (:  Its never inappropriate to post this study.  High IQ increases risk for developing allergies and mental health conditions - *especially* ADHD 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616303324 I'm in a the field of child health research. Recently, I went to a talk on exposure to flame retardant chemicals and child behavioral/developmental disorders. Half way into the talk, it became apparent that they also use these behavioral assessments as *proxies of IQ*. I was fuming. I'm all for reducing exposure to persistent organic pollutants that are just bad news in general, but conflating ADHD/ASD symptoms with loss of IQ?! I can't believe this actually happens. Maybe that's why people don't believe that I have ADHD, and likely ASD as well....SMH. This is what I was told when I brought it up in the Navy as well.  You can't have ADHD if you made it through A School.  Turns out when I got to the boat and suddenly had to study on my own to qualify for the next 2 years, I was awful at it.  What a shock.  Also, I joined the Navy because I didn't want to go to school for 4 more years, and ended up having to go to school for two years and qualify for another 2.  I should have just gone to school. I would have blurted out people with adhd have higher IQ than normal people.   

And it might have led to her educating herself 

Edit: with the replies here. It's the same effect I would expect to get from blurting this out.  People educate themselves.   :) So not only will he be undiagnosed, he will be featured on r/iamverysmart if his parents inflate his ego... I once got denied accommodations for my ADHD  on a standardized test (reduced distraction and 50% extended time) because my IQ score was too high... People with ADHD are very-very smart, beyond average!!! The coworker is ignorant and very stupid..... My mom would always tell me that I was smart and just lazy and moody. I was lucky though and got diagnosed in middle school, although she still controlled my medication for a long time and would withhold it, so until I was able to get it myself I didn‚Äôt do very well. I hope you corrected them I'm 24. Just told my mom i think i have inattentive ADHD and she says my teacher when I was a wee boy said she thought I have add but she thought "why medicate him".... And thats fine I think. But it would be nice to know I have a problem so that I could make the choice myself at an earlier age like in high school. But I have an appointment soon [in 2 weeks] I'm assuming its gonna take a while to get on meds but I'm being optimistic. 

I've taken a lot of online tests and been researching constantly. Everything points to inattentive adhd or "ring of fire" adhd. I'm not sure if the ring of fire is medically recognized but it seems to fit me about as well as the inattentive adhd. I'm one of the "smart" kids. But I struggle if I have stresses in my life. In lucky that right now I have no responsibilities except school and I have my own quiet space to escape from people.  This misconception really needs to be laid to rest. I was top of my class through high school, unmedicated. Got through uni, unmedicated. Yeah some of us can make it through, but I regret not doing anything about it earlier, i could've done much better.  Oooooo that'd make my blood boil. We get so much crap for having ADHD, so comments like that make me go 0-100 real quick. Lol I'd have been tempted to interject with "Yep, that sounds exactly like ADHD. Smart, but has problems focusing."

But then again, I've gotten used to having to educate people, and am old enough to not put up with as much stupid shit around me.  My dad had undiagnosed ADD until his adult life, and was watching my brother and I closely growing up for signs in us. We were both doing really well in school so he thought we got lucky. He was half right Yeah..my mom really let‚Äôs me down with this.  Recently I was reading a Dr. Seuss book to my son and my mom was listening in on the phone (we live far away from each other) and after I finished the book my mom said ‚Äúsee I don‚Äôt understand why you think you have ADD.  You read that so well with such good inflection and everything‚Äù.  

So much wrong.........   Um ..mom ...It‚Äôs a Dr. Seuss book,  I‚Äôm 35,  I‚Äôve read it at least 50 times already.. I do have a 4 yr old,  also you have a MASTERS in ART THERAPY!!!   How the hell can that be the reason you think I shouldn‚Äôt have ADHD?  (I didn‚Äôt actually say that it‚Äôs just how I felt/feel)  I think it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs in denial or feels guilty or something because i was diagnosed as a kid and she didn‚Äôt agree because I was a ‚Äúgood reader‚Äù and ‚Äútoo smart‚Äù...in 1st grade!!!   (I just had absolutely no comprehension).  And then because I finally put myself on medication as an adult (thankfully!!!) she‚Äôs trying to argue with me about it because I‚Äôm 35 and I can read a Dr Seuss book to my 4 yr old?!!  It really pisses me off thinking about it because she had so many of my teachers throughout the years, tell her that‚Äôs what they thought was going on with me and she always ignored anything they talked to her about.    I feel like it was a very large contributing factor in several other issues I had to deal with and manage then and also much later. Seriously....We need to do more for awareness of conditions like this as that kind of ignorance can be so damaging for the kids!! It's not necessarily her fault but it's people need to understand this stuff!!  


For anyone that's interested I posted a video about living with ADHD (without medication) on my YouTube a few months ago. I was diagnosed at School but my mum took me off Ritalin after a year as it was apparently turning me into a vegetable. I've been completely against taking meds since then but from at least having that awareness and having since read a bunch of books on the brain and ADHD I've developed certain coping mechanisms over time!   


I know meds can help massively, and I'd never suggest anybody to stop taking their prescription but it's just a personal preference for me...  


You can find the video here

&#x200B; I was actually put into special ed a year before my diagnosis and then taken out of special ed when I got my diagnosis because my doctor required an IQ test. It turned out that yeah I had ADHD but I also was extremely fucking bored with the curriculum in the 2nd grade because I had the Reading comprehension level and analytical thinking skills of a college freshman, which had a lot to do with my acting out and just strait up not even trying to participate in the curriculum. 


Smart and ADHD do tend to go hand in hand. 



Side note: I‚Äôm not a genius or anything. I‚Äôm pretty sure I am still at the college freshman level and I am nearly 30.  aka my entire life until freshman year of college  Please tell me you spoke up on behalf of that kid and all of us w/ ADHD and told that lady some facts.  I was incredibly lucky to have a teacher in my early years of education that saw that not only was I intelligent, but recognized my attention issues immediately. I got help early on because of it.   


Ignorance is the enemy, and it can make even the brightest students suffer, if they don't get the help they need.  That teacher is a total dick.  That's unfortunate and ignorant. You can be smart and have ADHD. It can interfere with your studies but it doesn't mean you're not smart. I got into high school and college and was able to graduate with honors. My family has a history of ADHD and we all graduated high school and college. Educated people make educated guesses.



Others just talk. By chance I read (a part of) my own diagnoses today, which clearly mentions that I have ADHD as well as a lacking in the skill of organizing & some other faults, as well as a high intelligence.  


So.. yeah. "But her grades are perfect" was the excuse for my sisters late diagnosis. my grades have always been trash so I got the diagnosis in a heartbeat Oddly enough, this didn't stop them from diagnosing me. Then again, I was a smart kid and always bouncing off the walls as soon as I got bored. Which, even in hindsight, is the correct response to boredom. I hate this mentality, it's the reason I didn't get diagnosed until 16. I only got checked out after begging for help... I wish more people knew that ADHD doesn't make people less intelligent.  Opposite for me. I went to a small country school for a few years.  They didn't let me take the TAAS test because they thought I would mess up the numbers for the school.  I moved schools at the end of 5th grade, they didn't have time to file for exemption for me.  I made a 100 on reading and 93 on math. After that the new district ran all of the aptitude tests on me.  Turns out I had a genius level IQ, top 90% in fact, should have been moved up at least 3 grades, but they decided that since 6th grade is already an awkward stage, throwing me in 9th grade would probably do more harm than good.  Up until middle school, my family (dad and older brothers) all just thought I was extremely airheaded. Despite the fact I'd get perfect grades on almost all of my SOLs (except 6th grade math).

My mom was the one to notice something was a bit off when she would give me, 12 or 13, 1-3 tasks to do, and my little brother, 3 or 4, 1-3 tasks, and he would finish all of them within a reasonable time, and I would maybe do the first task before I forgot or got distracted.

Turns out I had/have ADHD, and it runs very heavily on my moms side. I was told I was just a problem child. Now I am being tested for a bunch of stuff at 29 it is often ghastly how ignorant people are, especially professionals, and parents. I had trouble getting my daughter diagnosed by the specialist because she was too smart. This is unfortunately a common belief.  Why can't we be smart and have ADHD ? :( Mine was, "No, he memorized all these flash cards" LOL... Dumbest saying ever. 

I'm really smart. You'd never think I have ADHD. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I transferred from a small state college to the big flagship university in my state. 

But here I am, killing it. 

It took a decade, but I finally graduated from college. Even with a science degree...

Who would have thought of that?  Diagnosed at 23 in my last year of university cause of this stereotype.

We're incredible blaggers, we've had to learn to do it from a very young age.

Saw my school report from when I was 5 the other day, said something along the lines of; "Sam often appears to not be listening, but when questioned he is keeping up with the rest of the class." 

^(heheh fuckin' got 'er) This is exactly why it took so long for me to be diagnosed. [removed] Two years ago I told my mum I wanted to go to the doctors because I had read through the list of symptoms after speaking to someone on reddit (I think it was on /r/books, he told a story in the comments about his childhood and why he struggled doing certain things, like reading a book and paying attention in school, then he got diagnosed with ADHD and recommended people that felt similar to go and get checked out because the medication helped him so much), when I read his story it was like reading an autobiography of my life. I remember getting *really* excited after reading through the symptoms, not because I checked the box on pretty much every symptom and thus I most likely had it, but because I had finally found something that described me **perfectly**, there was a reason I had struggled so much to pay attention and why I was so hyperactive and had big mood swings in an instant, and that there were things I could do to get help. Unfortunately though, my mum got mad at me for suggesting such a thing and said I just ‚Äúwant something to be wrong with me‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt end up going. It wasn‚Äôt until I moved country last year (to America) where I decided to go get checked out because I was on my own. I found out that I did have it and I wasn‚Äôt just trying to make things up for attention. 

Funny story actually, myself and my brother both got diagnosed with ADHD on the same day, we live a few states away from each other, hadn‚Äôt talked to each other for a weeks. After I had been diagnosed,  I was walking out the doctors office when I received a text from him. He told me he just went to the doctor and got diagnosed with ADHD.  We had never spoken to each other about ADHD before that, it was a crazy coincidence. Same day and same time haha. This paved the way for my dad to finally also go and get checked because my brother and I definitely thought he had it too. Surprise surprise, he did have it, and we discovered that my cousins and grandpa also have it and were diagnosed years ago, we just never knew.  I got my mum to look at symptoms and such online to help understand, turns out she thought it was just being naughty in school and not being able to focus (I wasn‚Äôt naughty in school, and never told her about my focus). 

Anyway, ADHD sucks and I came on here to look at apps to help manage it, and I ended up forgetting about that and writing this rambling story. I didn't get diagnosed until I was 2 years out of college and into my career. I'm still a bit salty but eh ya can only look forward. That‚Äôs the convo for all women who didn‚Äôt get diagnosed until post puberty. I was a 3.75 gpa student until junior and senior year of high school. When I graduated I was a 3.0 and struggling and not knowing why. Fast forward 16 years and deciding to go back to school 4 years ago and struggling, failed out past 3 semesters, and finally got diagnosed. Now I know why I struggle and am maintaining straight A‚Äôs. School is fun again. I don‚Äôt fear or expect failure like I used to. Stimulants and therapy have helped immensely.  Should‚Äôve tried being a girl. In 1980. Same story: They can‚Äôt have ADHD.  Same  I didn't know this many people are in the same boat. Where are we sailing to? #metoo Same, except I didn't get diagnosed until after college. Looking back, someone should have noticed. I was regularly disruptive as a kid and college was way more difficult than it should have been. I graduated with a decent GPA, but I vividly remember professors saying "It's like pulling teeth with you" and "I have no idea how someone can understand this well enough to turn in the best project in the class, but fail almost every exam."

First "big boy job" was in a dull, quiet office with few definite goals or hard deadlines. Since I was a freshman, I had imagined that scenario as my perfect foot-in-the-door job. It broke me. The boring workspace, constant oversight, sterile bureaucracy, and unwritten professional social rules all added up to an ironically deafening environment. Just before this I worked in a ***very*** fast-paced electronic repair shop. High stress, constant problems, in-and-out asap, etc. I didn't like it much, but I was good at it and the tasks were usually quick enough to trigger a sense of reward. This office zombified me and stripped me of all motivation. No reward. Ever. Diet, exercise, supplements, socializing, nothing worked. I got diagnosed midway through and medication enabled me to finally figure out how to plan ahead and play to my strengths. 

That said, the work environment was way too sterile and my recommendations were always shot down. It started with a polite "for all I know ***I*** could have ADHD," but eventually my boss would go red and yell shit like "you're being selfish" and "if you can't work in the office as you agreed then you should quit." I only ever asked for a few hours of working remotely per week, either off the clock or over. Working on something in my own space is very stimulating to me and that drive is somehow strong enough to combat my shortfalls. I tested it on my own and actually proved it to my boss a couple of times. The guy just didn't like the idea of it, I think. Or maybe he thought I was lying. Who knows. That office lost 4 out of 9 employees in one year. Sinking ship.

Thankfully, I'm no longer with them. I'm still improving and figuring out how to stay productive, but I'm realizing that my ideal career is actually more freelance focused. My "boss" constantly changes, deadlines/goals are solid, and the projects are more rewarding because they're more varied and actually have an "end," rather than pivoting into a new direction or merging with other projects. I think I just never even tried to work on improving my executive function; I relied on my school schedule, parents, and girlfriend to fill that role.  Ugh same, except grad school. Anytime I mentioned it to my parents, they said ‚Äúi was too smart, but your younger sister probably has it.‚Äù I got diagnosed, the psychiatrist said ‚Äútextbook ADHD combined‚Äù. Parents still don‚Äôt believe.  40 for me At least it happened before you dropped out of a 2 year degree program in community college... After a 7 year long attempt....


Same with me but my circumstance was the above. *sigh* And now I'm in college getting diagnosed. If only it was at the beginning of the year instead of the end of it. \*sigh\* Ditto, but not until age 43 after graduating from a top law school and practicing for 15 years.  ü§¨ Until I was 35 YES. Me too. I just posted about this earlier before I saw this post. It's so frustrating in hindsight.  That's literally what prevented me from getting diagnosed until I was an adult father of 2 well into an unfortunately lack-lustre career as an embedded systems engineer.  That's what prevented me from getting diagnosed until I was 29 and making my third attempt at college. Not even I had considered that I might have ADHD because of the stigma of it being a "dumb person" problem. So sad. People are not educated enough about what this really is or what it really means. Saaaame. I still question myself when I see so many ppl here posting about struggling in school, then I remembered that I literally self-medicated with coke in high school since it "relaxed" me, which apparently it's not supposed to do to normal people. I was 46 and finally self diagnosed. Doctor confirmed it. I suspect many later diagnoses are because of higher than average intelligence  Hello, are you me? Heyyy! Same! Kept me from being diagnosed until I was 38 years old.... He's so smart if only he'd apply himself! [https://media.giphy.com/media/2fs2I4ujlBf20/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/2fs2I4ujlBf20/giphy.gif) R u a weightlifting doctor with ADHD brah? Me 2 brah.  No, I stayed quietly disgruntled. She didn't seem like the type who would be open minded about a stranger's opinion, and I wasn't looking for an argument.  I think the same sort of thing happens when interacting with someone who isn't fluent in the language they're trying to speak. They seem like they're pretty stupid, but in reality they're likely as smart as any other random person, and are merely struggling to communicate in an unfamiliar language. That's literally the same convo my mom and I had about 9 months or so ago. I was so mad that she never even mentioned it or the fact that my dad has it too, though undiagnosed as well. I don't think it's fair that I had to struggle though college not knowing what was wrong until I started studying child psychology in my last semester and was just "lightbulb" this is what I had/have. I then found this sub and read more about it and then got up the courage to mention it to my mom, who is a nurse but doesn't believe mental illness or learning disabilities and the like are as legitimate as people say they are, and she's just like "yea I know". lol, that's how me & my mom went; except I failed out of University :/ My mom said the same thing. " I just assumed you'd grow out it"  Story of my life, I'm smart enough that I could get ok grades without studying all the way up to university when I flunked out. Started falling asleep in class without being tired.   

Gonna get tested now not looking forward to talking to my parents about it. Unless it matches their narrow definition of ADHD (or ASD) it just not true. It took seeing a meltdown for them to believe that my oldest was autistic. When I first told them their reaction was "But he's so kind/nice/good child"...  That was me when I was his age.  Thank you on his behalf for actually caring to find the underlying reason instead of just claiming "oh you're just not trying hard enough" or whatever. Sounds like me. Only problem is I never had constant attention or structure. But I'm glad your son does! You'd have handed THEM the diploma! üëèüèºüëèüèº awesome!!! >I went through college not knowing I had ADHD. I graduated magna cum laude with my Bachelors and went on to get my Masters two years later with a flawless 4.0 GPA.

Same here.  I didn't get diagnosed until I was 32, long after I had graduated from college (I received a full ride to college and graduated with honors).  No, no it wouldn't have.  The least infuriating result is that she assumes you're calling her dumb and becomes hostile. People with an adhd DIAGNOSIS have on average a higher IQ. This is a form of self selection because getting diagnosed requires seeking help. I was under the impression the IQ of people with ADHD was evenly distributed? > It was concluded that children with ADHD are no more likely to have an above-average IQ than are other children.

&#x200B; I jokingly tell people that I'm mildly autistic..but its more of a self diagnosis than a joke. I get sensory overload real quick. People touching me [no I wasnt sexually abused], people being loud for too long, being in a large persistently crowded place...all make me want to be reclusive. [removed] I was supposed to be out of the shower an hour ago to get ready for my follow up with my psychiatrist instead I'm reading up on various subjects from this post to humpback whales :( Yup. It's very heritable and I'm pretty sure my dad has it because I see a lot of my odd ADHD behaviors in him, but he's developed a lot of coping mechanisms to deal with them. Both of his children have ADHD.

It was kinda interesting because I think he saw some of his odd behaviors in me and helped me develop my own coping strategies when he was helping me with my difficulties in school. He never really knew about ADHD but he tried to be as helpful as possible because he had similar experiences.

It's also really interesting because he has a job that is very good for someone who's intelligent and has ADHD. He has a lot of knowledge about certain older houses where we live and he bascially manages all of the jobsites for this small company that renovates those houses primarily. He basically drives from jobsite to jobsite supervising the work and answering questions because he has answers for so many obscure questions. I really respect him for his work ethic and how he's gotten a job that he's so good at. He basically worked up to that job from just doing construction work and carpentry. He probably works 60 to 70 hours per week and he answers work related calls all the time outside of that. He seems to get a huge amount of satisfaction out of his job and seeing what they're working on come together. I have a lot of similar experiences/satisfaction when I work on very tangible projects. I was the whole story and that's cool but tell us more about the apps you've found I'm always looking for more! I wasn't diagnosed until middle age. I was just the loud kid who couldn't pay attention in school and the loud, creative adult. If you look at those "Top 10 careers for people with ADHD" list, I've done most of them. 

But when I'm on, it's amazing. You just need to find your super-power.  I wasn't diagnosed until middle age. I was just the loud kid who couldn't pay attention in school and the loud, creative adult. If you look at those "Top 10 careers for people with ADHD" list, I've done most of them. 

But when I'm on, it's amazing. You just need to find your super-power.  I <3 you for that last line. That was a nice story.  I‚Äôm drawing a picture right now as I want to start making art to sell but instead I am 45 minutes into sims and YouTube and apparently reddit? Good luck on your productivity and I guess if you don‚Äôt laugh about it you cry about it.  Habitica is an awesome app. I use it to help motivate myself to do boring daily tasks.  I got diagnosed last year. I‚Äôm 35. I feel this hard, especially the saltiness. Yeah! I know the feeling. While I‚Äôm male, my in class performance never suffered thanks to innate intelligence (sounds so arrogant, but true) and good parents who forced me to study with them. But I wasn‚Äôt reading enough on my own due to ADHD, and my reading skills were very underdeveloped which hurt me on the ACT/SAT. Even on the math which is what I was good at. I was too slow reading the problems. Now I‚Äôm a grad student at a very prestigious US research university. I couldn‚Äôt be here without my diagnosis tbh (not just meds, but also just knowing I‚Äôm adhd and dealing with that).  Looks like I‚Äôm the captain of this ship. We‚Äôre going where no men or women have sailed before. And that‚Äôs because we‚Äôll get distracted along the way. 

(No really, I have my sailboating merit badge)  Somewhere really fast but then we'll take a detour in the Bahamas for a few months til we remember that we left the stove on and drive halfway home before running out of gas because we didn't fill up at the gas station we stopped at 20 miles back Use a backslash to remove the formatting of the hashtag 

\#metoo

#metoo I'm doing that now. Assessment in two weeks. Parents looked at me like I was crazy when I mentioned it. Yip 33 for me, well into the dissertation stage and also working a day job :/

Didn't find out till later that apparently my mom had been diagnosed in her 50s, but was told they couldn't give her the "official" DSM diagnosis because she got decent grades in school and didn't have a hard time learning to read. Reading happens to be her hyperfocus activity.  Same.  At least it happened before the constant comments of not reaching your potential, falling short, failure and not understanding what was wrong with you led to severe anxiety and persistent depressive disorder and an 2 psychiatric hospitalizations for suicidial ideation and a suicide attemept.
Funny how concerta worked better than any antidepressant for me. :D I belive that's what the kids call Insane Mode.  Hey, I'm the software engineering version of you!  Top CS grad school, straight A's, research track, now FAANG.  I'm that age now, and just diagnosed a few weeks ago.  Still kinda in shock.... That‚Äôs why I loved coke. Felt calm, usually. Really really great feeling. So much self stimulation growing up  Ahh.. that fine line between voicing facts to ignorant fools and not sounding like an asshole. Since I've made that conscious effort to not voice my thoughts, I've been generally more well liked. Best to ignore stupid people sometimes. Better for your self image and sanity.  Hmm, very smart decision! You must not have ADHD. It's such an infuriating situation. It's like... the combination of lack of knowledge about ADHD (specifically adult ADHD) with the general attitude that your grades in school are perfectly correlated to how successful you'll be later in life, you know? My mom didn't think ADHD was fake or anything but she just didn't know much about it to begin with, and I'm sure if she'd known it would affect me later in life she would have done something about it. But she didn't know because there's no information! And on the other side of things, my parents never even put any emphasis on our grades, but "good grades = all is fine" is such a pervasive attitude that it was apparently enough to get them to ignore my glaring time management issues, random emotional outbursts, and talkativeness/hyperactivity - all of which could have been dealt with when I was a kid. 

I try not to think about what my life would be like now if I'd been tested. I like my life now, I like where I'm at and the choices I've made, but at the same time, there's so much frustration and so much brain garbage for me to deal with that could have been mitigated if I'd just had the tools I needed to learn to cope earlier on than I did. It makes me angry and sad to think about. My husband clearly thinks it‚Äôs utter bullshit. :/  ‚ÄúLuckily‚Äù it was also me. I‚Äôm also an extremely intelligent ADHD-PI, who went undiagnosed as a child and young adult. It wasn‚Äôt until another child of mine(who is combined and struggles in school) that I really learned about what ADHD can be and do and how it can present and my whole life made sense. But by then, decades of being put down had done some damage. My son was diagnosed just this year. Understanding exactly why these things are happening with him really helps us create a better system for him. I keep telling people, kids with ADHD can have great grades and do amazing in school, sometimes they just need to take a different path than the other kids.  See how this works?  Now it's a topic of interest which you might look up Linking to ADDitude is no longer allowed. They have become a shill for pseudoscientific products and products not validated by empirical research.

It's a bold strategy, Cotton.  That's so ADD!
:-) According to the doc who diagnosed me, no trait is more heritable than ADHD except height.  Lol, my dad has the exact same job  Apparently, my superpower is writing an insane amount of fanfiction. Just need to figure out how to convert that to a paying gig... 44 here. Went for diagnosis after my son got his. Yep. Meds are AMAZING for both of us. I‚Äôve only been on for 6 weeks but I see it all so clearly now, my past life, of cigarettes and cocaine and oxy and anything, really. I had a ton of coping mechanisms and have been fairly successful in my life, but suddenly I‚Äôm able to have normal conversations and focus on what other people are saying without cutting them off and blurting out inappropriate jokes and I don‚Äôt always assume the negative intent of what people say    Also literally, considering how fucking salty Adderall is. Oooh, I got my Horsemanship merit badge. We could all together go out on the ocean, with me upon my pony on your boat. Thank god, someone else is driving  <3 36 for me I'm so happy you found the shape of that hole so-to-speak. And it's true that as bad as whatever situation I was dealing with was, it always could have gone worse. Thanks for reminding me to be thankful.  And what did it cost us?  The shame.  The guilt.  The confusion.  The late nights and inconsistency.  The damage to relationships and self esteem.  I‚Äôve been grieving but not for the diagnosis ... for all those terrible years when I couldn‚Äôt figure it out no matter how hard I tried.  All that blame! Holy crap. I didn't know this. I tried coke a couple times like 5 years ago and I remember it relaxing me. Is this why? Because I have ADHD? other people describe it so differently. There's a fine line between voicing facts to ignorant fools and not sounding like an asshole. There's also a time for sounding like an asshole, and it's when you're sitting there getting called an idiot (albeit inadvertently perhaps) and thus you stand up for yourself, and standing up for kids and others. 

Someone called me I'm a bitch recently. I'm really fucking sick of shitty people and having to share a planet with them, so, if putting someone in their place and standing up for myself (or others) makes me a bitch, well golly jeepers I'm a massive bitch.

Grow a fucking pair of ovaries already. This is so incredibly underrated holy shit. Let's be honest, most of these people won't go away and do their own research. They'll just repeat what they've heard as if they're well read on the matter. Now you're combating false statements with more false statements. And if they do happen to do their own research and discover that you're wrong, it then makes them question the credibility of anything else you've told them, even if it's true. It's counterproductive in trying to educate people about what ADHD actually is. Waterproof phone If it weren't for the fact that both of my parents and both of my brothers are very obviously related to me, this little nugget may make me think I was adopted. 14" taller than both of my parents (and my brothers aren't much shorter than me) and neither of them has ADHD. Dad's dyslexic though.
 "Why on earth are there six different types of wire, and WHY IS THE KNOB AND TUBE STILL HOT!!!???"

? Lol!

&#x200B; I mean it's amphetamine salts what did you expect Now I **need** to watch *Dead Man's Chest* again; I remember they put Beckett's horse on a rowboat to take his short ass to the mainland.

Fuck me, I'm so distracted, I have so much work to do and I hate my brain Thank you. I‚Äôm happy too. It could‚Äôve gone worse for me too. Good luck on all your future endeavours. I hope you get that degree if you still want it, or something better, or anything else you want.  Yep. And so much effort, so much last-minute rushing (and somehow pulling it off anyway -- for so many years).  Luckily, I've been in a pretty good spot for a while now.  Well, until I joined a tech company full of brilliant high performing workers, got impostor syndrome so bad it led to anxiety and depression (but still somehow getting good performance evaluations), realized it was work that was bothering me, saw a therapist, saw a doctor, and it finally clicked.

Adderall seems to basically fix it -- to be able to sit down, say "I need to do X" , and actually **fucking being able to do X right then and finish it right away** is literally the most bizarre thing I've ever felt in my life.  I've been working so goddamn hard to get everything done my whole life, that when I don't need that effort just to get moving, I'm now a goddamn machine.  Well, maybe no better than my coworkers, but hell, they're goddamn machines too.  :-)

Not sure what to do with my impostor syndrome now.  Since I've basically confirmed I actually was an impostor -- it's not just a feeling anymore, it's a fact.  I tricked them.  I tricked them all, all this time.  I was going to say I haven't been grieving, but I think some denial and anger are probably fair descriptions, so maybe I'm just in the early stages now.  Good thing I've already got a therapist! I assumed at the time we were all experiencing the same thing. But in retrospect, perhaps not. I do think it‚Äôs perhaps why I loved it so much. It really quieted my mind. I mean, obviously it‚Äôs an insanely popular drug so perhaps everyone is enjoying it for the other parts too but I know that there is a similarity between how I felt on coke and how I feel on my meds.  I get what you you're saying and have felt both ways, but they have no obligation to enter a confrontation with this person. It was a conversation not meant to forget them anyway and it was about their kid. Plenty of understandable reasons there for NOT butting in.  Sometimes I care so little about the people and their opinions that it truly isn't worth the effort of opening my mouth. My standard reply to being called a bitch is basically "yes, and?"..

And when people tell me I'm annoying or obnoxious I thank them. I try so hard at it, you see... :P Was more referring the the time wasting ability  Looks like the terrain from Iraq.   The genes for height are capacity, the reality is based on that plus nutrition. A cure lol.  This thread is a pure crystalization of a conversation between people with ADHD. It's glorious. This!!!! You are the software engineering me!!!  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt take my meds because - although they work like fucking magic, exactly like you describe -  they also raise my blood pressure to extremely dangerous levels.  One step forward - five steps back.  I recently changed jobs to one where I have amazing administrative support (she GETS me and lovingly keeps me organized on a daily basis) and a competent paralegal (who handles a lot of the overwhelming tasks that drain my momentum).  This has made a HUGE difference.  I may also seek out an ADHD coach.   I'm not on medication now so I can't compare the two. But I thought it was interesting. The biggest reason I didn't say anything and risk looking like an asshole was because I was still at the mercy of her scissors-wielding friend. 

Also, as frustrating as her comment was, I believe it was ignorant but not malicious. It‚Äôs taken me 25 minutes to get through brushing my teeth thanks to my iPhone  Oh yeah lol I feel like the bigger problem is overhearing the conversation, it's not your fault you heard, but interjecting feels a bit like invading their privacy.

If they were talking to you directly for some reason, and then they said that, it's entirely easier to say something like "Really? I heard that smart people can have it too." Not offensive, doesn't make you an asshole, just plants enough doubt that they question their source. If they simply say no it's not possible after that, then you have to feel sorry for that kid. At least you're brushing them tho  Holy shit, I gotta go brush my teeth, almost forgot.
