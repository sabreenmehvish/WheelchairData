Working at 9:00am, but binge reading papers on A.I at 2:00am So I’ve been lurking here for quite awhile, but procrastinated from the two minutes it took to enter my email address and select a username and password so that I might participate.

I’m getting assessed next month for adult adhd, and I’m presently about 31.89 years of age. I’ve always had issues focusing and pulling energy together to do things that I didn’t find intrinsically interesting; this has provided interesting challenges at work, and throughout school, whereby the usual consensus is that I just don’t try because I’m lazy.

I’m aware of confirmation bias and so am trying not to self diagnose, but some of the stories here just ring so true and they’ve helped me garner understanding over my own strengths and especially my weaknesses; I feel less weird when I trawl through the posts here.

As denoted by my title, I have work at 9am and it’s presently 2:15am here in Australia, and I can’t sleep because I suspect hyperfocus is the blame for my recent (last three days) obsession with reading academic papers on artificial intelligence, specifically by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Irving John Good.

Seriously, if you’re into this stuff and want to trigger some hyperfocus, and some anxiety about the next few decades of exponentially increasing computational technologies, read this: Cognitive Biases Potentially Affecting Judgement of Global Risks - https://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf

My brain feels like a tuning fork right now. Okay first. The singularity is near. Amazon's fucking Alexis randomly laughing. That shit will never be in my home but I bet Siri will catch up.

Second, I wish that we could use finally feeling understand via /r/ADHD as an indicator of ADHD.  Haha, I do this on HackerNews all the time!
