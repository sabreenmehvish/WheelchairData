Social media is an even bigger trap to people with adhd. Everyone is addicted to the dopamine fixes, and it's hard to stay focused with a slot machine in your pocket. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39RS3XbT2pU

Just watched this and thought the adhd community could especially relate. They really are exploiting our vulnerabilities, and it's hard to stay focused with a slot machine in your pocket.  I'm just happy that there isn't a website offering not only endless variety of interesting content that's compartmentalized enough to quickly click through, and also offers an entertaining comment section... If something like that existed I'd never get anything done at work! Facebook is a nightmare unless you curate it. Unlike Reddit, Facebook starts by bombarding your feed with everyone you've ever known. Unfollow anyone that rubs you the wrong way. Absolutely. I left Facebook recently, and I constantly make use of 'Do Not Disturb' or leave my phone away from my person. I began to realise that my phone is always taking up mental energy somewhere in the background, it's begging me to check and see what's changed, what all the new whizbang things are.  
  
Emails? Check. Facebook notifications? Check. Reddit mail? Check. WhatsApp? Check. Latest news? Check. And then by the time I've finished checking, there might be more, so I could go around again. Switching off from that is a fucking godsend. I stopped using Facebook ages ago, after I started seeing posts from people other than my friends list composed of people I actually know. At that point, I realized it was heading in a direction I wasn't comfortable with, and I jumped ship. I can totally relate to the downfalls of having never-ending entertainment in your pocket, though. Upvoted because it's an interesting topic of discussion! I have a few additional thoughts below, because I did a lot of work during my degree surrounding the intersection(s) of society and technology. Feel free to skip if you like, it's simply a more nuanced explanation of my opinion.

\--

It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone observant that social media of all kinds has effectively become direct mass marketing of ideology, and of the status quo at that. It was reasonably inevitable, given the interests that control it. That said, I don't agree that "they are exploiting our vulnerabilities" any more than, say, any other advertisement or ideologically-driven media usually does. Facebook might have more power in that respect solely due to how it operates - as an "echo chamber" of agreeable thoughts/opinions - but it's ultimately up to the individual to decide whether or not that's the type of intellectual world they want to be involved in. Nobody is playing our dopamine receptors like a piano (any more than usual), although to listen to this video you'd think that was the case.  Interestingly, referring to this process as "exploiting our vulnerabilities" seems to belie some degree of faith in the technological imperative. That's not a sly veiled criticism, either, just an observation. I realize many people see science and technology as some kind of god-like entity, I'm just not willing to try to convince them of the validity of the issues with how we practice science, which often end up reinforcing our own beliefs rather than challenging them. Frankly, I have better things to do than listen to yet another deluded nouveau-riche "Silicon Valley"-style technocrat. We all probably do. Class consciousness and all that jazz.  :) TLDR there is literally **nothing** social behavior-wise about "social media".

Get rid of it! 

I swear I'm still a mess, but the depression is more than manageable now, I have SO much less anxiety, and I'm able to think more critically since obliterating my FB instagram and twitter. And by "critical thinking" I'm not talking about *deconstruction*, like your idiot literature teacher who's never lived outside of academia is. 

From my experience, there's nothing actually *social* about "social media. It's actually most likely the most *devisive* force in modern society. One of if not the most *schismatic*

In theory the world wide web exposes people to new ideas and ways of thinking. That was the goal. We didn't hit the mark.

Social media does the *opposite* of exposing individuals to new ideas (*which are SCARY*), cultures, and worldviews: What it does is enable toxically idealistic and inflexible people to find others with ideals that are as similar as possible to *isolate* their way of thinking and *reinforce* it in an "echo chamber". *It does not expose you to new perspectives*, only to *those that will* **confirm your bias** because you get to *block* ideas that get too far into your comfort zone! Hell, you get to punish your rival idealist *via proxy* by "reporting" something that "offends" you. You only get the rhetoric and perspectives that you don't isolate yourself from. 

You don't have to grow. You don't have to strive to understand. You don't have to see the world through different eyes. You just get to "Like" or "Dislike" something, and chase the "high" of those precious, completely inconsequential "likes". I feel like I have the opposite issue. I forget to utilize Facebook or Instagram because it feels like a lot of work, so I end up neglecting them.  The video gave me the heebie-jeebies. This monster of social networks has been fed for so long that even discussions like perils of social networks have to be discussed within the same platform that we are criticizing.

Am I genuinely interested in this discussion, or am I just commenting to get my dopamine fix? This is exactly why i got rid of the facebook, and twitter apps. Anything that gives you constant notifications is bad news for me. At least with reddit i have to actually log in to see comments. this. so much yes lol. i've gotten to the point where i can literally handle only one active social media account. i was trying to keep together three, and it became just a total shit show rofl. awesome. thanks for sharing this. just what i needed to see. thank you.  I get tempted to just delete all social media sometimes. I know how much it effects my productivity but persist in using it Whatever you do don’t get into social media marketing. It’s a black hole Haven’t watched the video but wanna participate in the discussion. I deleted my FB several months ago, and deleted my IG, Snapchat, and twitter right before the new year. I decided to delete my tumblr but I remade shortly after.


I totally agree with social media being an echo chamber yada yada chasing attention, but I don’t necessarily believe it’s a bad thing—at least not completely. I know it’s shallow attention, but I honestly believe it’s somewhat healthy to have an avenue to seek some kind of attention, which I crave regularly and usually suddenly. I can post a selfie to tumblr to accomplish that, but no need to post it on 4 or 5 social media websites in hopes of a response. I can just post to one website and leave it at that. At least that’s my current strategy for 2018! Yeah. The problem is that although social media is a trap, it's a trap which holds some of the only connections I have with other people. So I've been trying to limit my time on it without cutting myself off entirely. It's better than it used to be, but still not great. I had a huge addiction to it and it was really problematic. We aren't really monitored or restricted that much at work online and unless there's something broken I need to fix immediately I'm left to my own devices, so I found it really easy to lose hours just arguing shit with people on Facebook. I restricted it to just messenger now (messenger.com gives you facebook messenger without the facebook). Political arguments were the biggest timewaster, especially considering the absolute clusterfuck both UK and US politics has been the past year. I win this because I’m SUPPOSED to go on social media for my job so bingo fixed that I’m never on it. Lol. Yeah I gotta set schedules if I want to get anything done. Like no reddit before 3:00 How would someone go about cutting down on YouTube? It takes up the most of my time and I really want to use it less but there are a lot of creators I still want to watch. Maybe I can start by unsubscribing to all of the channels I don't watch EVERY upload from. You might steer clear of cryptocurrency, then I totally agree with this! It’s four am here and i had a fever today, so what am i doing? Sleeping? Nope! I’m browsing reddit because I like memes more than sleep. Why do people think Facebook is so addicting? I don't get it, there's not much of value there besides finding other peoples numbers and planning meetings with friends and family. This is one of the reasons I have what's called a "dumb phone."  A pre paid no frills generic cell phone that takes shit photos, limited access to the internet and even shittyier access to social media.  Saves money to....I have no interest in trying to access social media or games or well, anything on it because it's a shitty no frills phone. See, I guess this is just another one of those "So does this mean maybe I *don't* have ADHD?" gut checks for me.

I'm barely on Facebook.  I like my wife's posts, and I've become friends with one other woman whose posts I really agree with, but I don't respond to, because I'd feel like a creeper (as if just liking and hearting things doesn't do that enough, right?)

I don't post unless it's dumb nerd memes, or an occasional "My friends are awesome" to my sub-100 friends list.  Who respond with thumbs up, hearts, or "Thanks", if anything at all.

I don't get feedback, because I don't post, so I don't feel the need to post....so I feel...lonely?

Maybe that's just it?  I don't know.  I could delete the app now if I wanted and it wouldn't bother me a bit, (but I can't, thanks, S8 Plus!) it's just kinda more a reminder that I'm more alone, even if I do have just under 100 'friends'. Very nice. One of the first posts I made to this subreddit was linking these technologies to ADHD and it was deleted by a moderator, whom I asked to explain why - and he never did. All he said was it was too off topic. But here we clearly see the link between distractability and ADHD, and focus, concentration, the whole symptoms list is linked to social media.

I was banned from a tech website because I was just about the only one who consistently questioned the value of ICT, which is a bit broader than what this video talks about, social media. I have argued for years that facebook and other social media companies willfully appealed to people's natural needs. I have even recently on here argued that the human need to communicate, to be heard is fundmantal to what it means to be human. 

When I was young and the internet came up and my friend showed me his 28k8 modem, one of the first experiences I had with internet was how he would go on IRC, enter a religious channel and started trolling these faithful people. 

As almost all I accepted this novel technology without criticism. Everyone accepted it but no one had the sense of asking questions on what the drawbacks were. ICT was pushed into society because money was to be made. And today we have hypocrites becoming heroes, who willfully addicted populations to social media. 

And I think it is very relevant to ADHD, because in some ways society at large shows signs of ADHD-like behavior. And that reflects badly on those with the actual neurophysiological impairment.

"That each new method of of transporting commodity or information should have to come into existence in a bitter competitive battle against previously existing devices is not surprising. Each innovation is not only commercially disrupting, but socially and psychologically corroding as well."
-- Marshall McLuhan

And now we see how social media intended to disrupt people for profit for shareholders. They knew exactly how to manipulate the masses. 

Even on reddit we are being manipulated with this point system and I am very vulnerable to it myself. I love to get a high score. Because I got so little from my parents when I was a kid. When people put me on 0 or lower, in doing so usually because my opinion is not appreciated, I feel hurt. And I believe it is the intention of others to inflict this pain as a form of social control. 

It took me months to subscribe to reddit because it is a social medium. It only shows my desperation to connect to others. And it enticed me as well because I was made to feel my opinion could be helpful to others. Which probably, on the larger scale of things, matters little. I have made a footfall. And now I must witness this Parker guy saying to a person who is not on social media 'Oh, but you will be.' 

I have failed to protect myself even being *aware* of the insidious systems they deploy. Last when I replied to someone having problems with smart phone use and requested names of apps to limit the time he used them I was downvoted for my reply. 

Now someone else makes this post with this video and I feel compelled to reply because it is precisely what I have been worried about for like a decade now.

This is basically an 'I told you so' when others, elsewhere, consistently put me down with 'tin foil hat' comments. And loads of these people worked in IT obviously. So I was a threat to their income model.

Now we face, as I said before, as ADHD'ers more so than most others, the social disruption caused by these distractions. I've been trying for almost a decade to make people aware of privacy issues. And every time I saw soemthing on the horizon, what was to come, I talked about it and warned people. 

I said there would be sexual harassment of girls. And it became a reality. I warned about suicides, and they happened. I warned about 'fake news' and it happened. I warned about loss of concentration and productivity from smart phone use and it happened. I warned about hacking of smart home tech, it happened.

I warned about much more and usually I was at least two years ahead of the curve of awareness. 

I keep warning about the 'Internet Of Things' that is being pushed by IT people and everyone working in the field of ICT. And now we already see what I warned about: how kid toys with camera's in them might not be a good idea, or microphones. I have been warning about 'smart meters' for many years. It will not take too long now when we see more reports on the hacking of them.

I have been warning about how vital water works infrastructure is linked to internet, making us vulnerable to foreign attacks. Recently there was a big storm here and all 5 major flood protection systems were closed to hold the water out. If at that moment these systems had been hacked, I might have needed to use a boat to go to the supermarket.

I joked on sex toys being connected...they are there! 

So yeah. This is one area of foresight where my brain is very capable. I had no privacy as a kid, while my brother was allowed the key to his room. The argument was that 'if there was a fire, I would not be able to get out because I had locked the door'. My mother felt entitled, it was HER house, to step inside without knocking to bring me washed clothes. It always amazes me how in films and series I see parents knock on a kid's door asking if they can come in. I never had that luxury. 

My brother's room was in the attic, where all the smoke and heat will go in a burning house. So their argument was nonsense. For this reason I believe I am a privacy fighter and a technorealist. 

ADHD and mobile devices is like water and fire. And now I am here and it just feels *wrong*. And some people on here will be personally offended by this post. Because we *are* addicted, we get some *use* out of these devices or so we tell ourselves, because we are all *deeply*  indoctrinated with technological paradigms and have been taught and told to think that all technology is advantageous to us and to society. 

Now parents, who were  raised without ICT had to raise kids in a society changing extremely quick. My father had problems with using a computer back in the 70's. This vast machine with spinning tapes. It was so heavy they had to re-enforce the concrete floor. 

My parents had no concept of the dangers of internet. If I had kids, I might have been able to teach them and warn them but that never happened. But even i might not have been able to conceive of the drawbacks.

People tell me it all is a 'raced race'. It is done. We now live after the fact and must go with it. These people in the vid say otherwise. I wonder if people on here would have the courage to ban these things from their lives or severely reduce the use, to control it.

“We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.”
-- Marshall McLuhan

The guys in this vid are saying something McLuhan wrote about back in the 60's, before internet. Amazing. So is my opinion really that undesirable? We are more vulnerable to distractions and emotional manipulation of our psyche than most others. 

Have you not read on here how people share they bought complete new hobbies because they read about it and felt inspired? THIS is what is being done on a global scale.

"It is fashionable to suggest that cyberspace is some island of the blessed where people are free to indulge and express their individuality. This is not right. I have seen many people spill out their emotions – their guts – online and I did so myself until I started to see that I had commodified myself. Commodification means that you turn something into a product which has a money value. In the 19th century, commodities were made in factories by workers who were mostly exploited. But I created my interior thoughts as commodities for the corporations that owned the board I was posting to, like CompuServe or AOL. And that commodity was then sold on to other consumer entities as entertainment. Cyberspace is a black hole, it absorbs energy and personality and then re-presents it as an emotional spectacle. It is done by businesses that commodify human interaction and emotion. And we are getting lost in the spectacle."
-– Carmen Hermosillo a.k.a. ‘humdog’ (1994)

RIP Carmen. I am convinced as a species we are not ready ethically, for ICT and that our technology advanced faster than out ethical backbone. Life was better before internet, because the depth of the insight into our psyche currently is staggering. Even democracy is not safe anymore, with foreign powers manipulating votes. 

ICT is the infrastructure of our loss of privacy and other human rights. And we, defacto, now must face the decline into a new never predicted pseudo-democracy or a dictatorship 3.0 where we feel free but are manipulated to consume and vote. And these manipulations are based on Freud's nephew, Edward Bernays, the 'father of marketing'. 

God luck to you all.  Oh no. I've done nothing but read other people's opinions all day I will say at least Reddit feels less like purposeful exploitation even though it does play against our weakness. I don’t know if it’s still true but last I heard they still weren’t technically profitable. I quit Facebook.... Only to land on Reddit instead. I can control my Redditing because to me it’s less of a quick fix then Instagram or Facebook.  Where is Reddit I usually find myself reading more.  Facebook and Instagram or just photo roulettes to me and I couldn’t help but sit Indian stylw in my bed miserable at the time wasted.  Got rid of both,  I have 0 Social media  now and I’m just so much happier in general. When people ask how I spend so much time on reddit, I say that it’s more or less perfectly designed to grab my attention and never let go.  
Endless new content, any subject or category I can think of (plus many that I can’t imagine and/or would rather NOT imagine).  
It’s more addictive than anything I’ve ever experienced. There is, and I stumbled upon it one day. should we tell him? True. But once it's curated I'm even more interested.

"I can do what with a Raspberry Pi?"

"A friend is weaving, that looks fun."

"Another friend is cross stitching? That looks fun."

"A new notification? Someone needs me!" > Unfollow anyone that rubs you the wrong way.

This makes a big difference. Also I removed the app and 'forgot' the password, so I only have access from my desktop PC. I hate how they changed the notification system. It went from only telling me when someone interacted with one of my posts to notifying me whenever someone adds photos or shares something completely unrelated to me. It’s such a blatant attempt to increase the amount of notifications people get.  I instantly unfollow anyone who posts constant pictures and updates of their child. Unless their kid is hilarious. And land in a rosy bubble. Where you only hear what you want to hear? This is called social engineering, well, it is part of it.

 I really wish I could delete facebook but I feel like it's a major source of communication between my friends and I, especially with group chats and event invites. I deleted it for about a year once and hardly anybody talked to me or invited me out anywhere.  A smart watch really helped me. It lets me see emails, texts, etc and dismiss them without getting stuck in a technology loop. I left Facebook a couple years ago, and it is terribly alienating for someone with ADHD. I never get invited to anything that nobody goes out of their way to reach out to me.

Not that I'd want to go anyway once the day showed up. Or I'd forget and plan something else.

But the improved battery life on my phone, and the time I spent doing other things instead of trying to compare my life to others, and since I've left there's been the whole listening through your phone and shit, I'm so happy i left.

Enjoy freedom. Don't relapse.  I'm currently writing an essay on disruptive technology (social media) for sociology... any tips, major articles, research you read that could help? :) I disagree that the it is up to the individual. How often is this slogan used to legitimize something bad? This is an age old philosophical question that the ancient Greeks already pondered over. 

I question that 'the individual' has enough internal power to successfully detach from something bad. The question becomes to what extent the government may intervene in a person's  personal life and liberties for the benefit of all of society. Where must the line be drawn?

In my opinion human individuals are prone to manipulation and have limited self-defense resources when the attack is aimed at basic human needs and emotions. This is why social media are so successful. There is this illusion that 'the individual' is empowered enough to make his own decisions. But the attack goes below the empowerment because it appeals to more deep human vulnerabilities.

So can an individual truly decide without being manipulated? I think not. We should rather accept our human frailties and vulnerabilities. Those who harm us hide behind our own delusion of grandeur, that somehow *I* will not sub come to these onslaughts. Marketing is based on the theories by Freud. It is the understanding of the human psychology that makes marketing successful.

And from marketing on to social media, which is a new and dangerous extension of it.

All technologies are extensions of our body or psyche. A tv is an extension of eyes. A radio an extension of our ears. You can even say that a sofa is an extension of your ass. Internet is an index into our desires. An extension of the mind. And the human mind is a fickle thing. 

With ICT we have made ourselves vulnerable as individuals, because we all have our own ISP, our own echo chambers, and we pick what we want to believe and filter out the rest. 

How much free choice do you really think we have and how free are we really to make up our own minds anymore? I think the notion of individual responsibility has been a hollow phrase for a long time now. 

I think ICT plays our dopamine pur sang! You see, ICT is not *just another technology*. ICT is a *fundamentally different extension of our body and brain.* This is not when you invent a spear, and then by thinking on the design you develop a spear thrower, then a bow, which is like a short spear but flung from a bow, to a ballista, to a flintlock rifle, to an assault rifle and a ray-gun.

ICT is a technology that plays directly into our most profound humanness. The need to communicate, to form social groups, to interact, to be heard, to share in society, share symbolism and cultural paradigms. ICt *is* what it means to be human. And now we have opened Pandora's box. It is now our own human failure and success that through ICT created a feedback loop directly into our neurology and our mind, where our subconscious can now freely roam and all the filth buried deep within can now spread and be known by millions of others.

ICT is dangerous because *it connects without restraint.* Where in early days a spy could make photo's in an office of documents and be stopped by vigilance, information can now spread. Information is not understood by most people.

What is information? Information (other than data) is a a self-replicating virus-like entity that *wants to be known and spread*. And it uses our minds to do so. 

Information cannot be contained. Information has value, unlike data. Information is what comes out of data and gets a value *in- and of itself.*  Because information is always useful to someone at some time. 

This is why ADHD'ers often hoard and collect useless information out of interest in something. Bookmarks that are never revisited. But we keep them because  *what if...* one day it becomes useful. 

I get what you are saying. I often wonder about american ex-generals who had no qualms of destroying other countries and then later after retirement are all weepy weepy about how they feel they were used to create the conditions for corporate profit.

"Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear - kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor - with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it ..."
-- US General Douglas MacArthur

"I spent thirty-three years and four months in active service in the country's most agile military force, the Marines. I served in all ranks from second lieutenant to major general. And during that period I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.
-— Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler

In the same way these bozo's now admit to their despicable morality. 

 This... I never seem to be able to keep track of it let alone my cellphone. It becomes like another distraction and then a stressor. Though my life can be summed up with that word, distraction.  That is a good point. We are made into hypocrites and believe me, if I could get a dollar every time someone accused me of being a hypocrite I would have been wealthy. 

When you criticize technology, a fundamental paradigm in our society, you get called a hypocrite because you sued a pc and internet to share that view. The thing is, they are right, but to a point. I've been told I cannot take a pill for a headache because I criticize technology. In other words, *any* criticism on *any* technology is not welcome. 

But I grew up in a technological society, as such I too have been indoctrinated. Even if I wanted to to, I could not use a checque in a store because they have been phased out. More and more my dealings with municipal services need to be done in an e-office, some website where we login with out social-security number. 

I get fined if I want a paper nota for my electricity bill because 'it is better for the environment to get a pdf/login on website'. But they forget their servers use electricity 24/7/365. 

We are forced to participate. And I don't feel I have to do more than others to put these issues on the map. 

You know, there is this notion in many people that 'when you do voluntary, beneficial, non-profit, ideological work, you should be poor for doing it'. In other words, a sort of Calvinistic view that a saint must be poor, that a benefactor must be poor. You will see people make it an issue that Al Gore lives in a big house (despite all his solar panels) and that for that reason he isn't trustworthy when he agenda's  climate change. It implies hypocrisy. So Al Gore if to be taken  seriously, must live in a very modest home. And what is allowed in unclear.

So to discuss these issues and how they relate to ADHD in my opinion doesn't make you vulnerable to being criticized more so than any of us who use technology and are pushed into it. 

 Yeah I hate auto notifications. Only for texts and email. Every other app can fuck off. I hate that they all default to on. All these little beeps in the middle of the night. ugh One of the best things I did was delete my FB profile, it's been several years now clean. I don't use other well known platforms except Reddit, I think it's quite different, especially when notifications are turned off.

Google inbox has allowed me more control over when I'm notified of emails, and do not disturb on my phone for large parts of the day (with exceptions set for starred people or multiple calls in a period) has allowed a more structured approach to using this technology.

 Do it and do not look back. My dosage is down, my productivity is up, and holy shit *I actually have goals again*. What u mean as 'black hole'? Unfortunately my job relies on social media :(  Yeah for some things it's necessary. I'm freelance and my image online can get me more work, so at least some of it is necessary. But lately I've been trying to limit my mindless screen time, and allocate time for it after I've done something productive. Are you saying I have to stay up past midnight to get my reddit fix?!  Unfortunately, it's more to do with self-control and time-management than anything else. Regardless of the mindless unproductive rewarding activity, you have to allocate time for recreation after you've done something productive. Or reward yourself with it after crossing something off your to-do list. Which is why it's so hard for us with ADD to stay away from it because we crave constant stimulus and are terrible with time-management. :-( I literally cannot stop looking at the price of Bitcoin. When it was on route to $25k, I’d check at least once a minute. My friends/co-workers think I’m crazy*

*Currently, not diagnosed with ADHD, but have my assessment next week. Although, I’m 99.999% sure it will be confirmed.  Try adding in your own opinions for an even better high! And don't get me started on seeing that little orange envelope light up... Hello me Remember when notifications actually meant something? 

And yet, even with nothing there, I still fall for it while hating myself. Unlike junk mail in my email inbox which I mentally filter out, I still feel the compulsion to tap through to see what all these garbage notifications are. not to say, maybe we are about to develop an unhealthy unbalanced view of the world. 

Eg.: Social media has this personalization thing that let me see only what I want to see.  
In my feeds everyone have more or less the same opinion and frames the world just like me. It may be the real fake news because _me_ and my peers are never wrong ;) It is immoral to expose children to others. This information will never be lost. One day when they are adults they will be confronted by someone who saved their pix.  Yes. If necessary. That's a shame :(. You can delete the social feed and keep just the messenger, but obviously that doesn't help with event invites. Than they were not really friends. 

You know what someone said to me once? They were communicating through Whatsapp. And I didn't. Because it is a datamining service. And to put my e-mail or phone number in there means big data can connect me to people who also have ADHD. And it is none of their business. 

When I subscribed to reddit, I put an ICT-gun to my temple and fired the trigger. So I should not have too much delusion on where it is known I have ADHD. 

What they said is 'If you want friends, get on Whatsapp'. Emotional blackmail.  You can delete the app without deleting messenger. Maybe start hats with those you're trying to stay in contact with? I'm three weeks Facebook free and it's been amazing. I literally don't miss it at all.  This. Although it sucks, I got an analog watch for Christmas that I really like, but I know my smartwatch does so much for streamlining my flow. I can't be that guy that wears two watches though, lol.  Yes, I can link you some later tonight or tomorrow when I get a chance to dig around - good to see another sochead (I think I made that up). Yeah, keep following me and find me when my posts are downvoted. 

Also, research technorealism. Wiki has some on it. I said that it's up to the individual to determine whether or not they wish to be involved. Actually detaching (as a process) is a different thing with many social and psychological factors to wade through. Many people successfully leave Facebook because they find it "bad", so I assure you that 'the individual' does *theoretically* have the capacity to detach. There is always going to be some issue or another to solve with stuff like this, though. I let it go fairly easily, but I stopped getting invited to things since people I know primarily use FB for invites to parties and such. Now they know to text, call, or message me directly. Where I was willing to be an active informant to others about my choice, some may not find it so easy, perhaps owing to social anxiety or other difficulties like ostracision. I could go on.

My opinion isn't based on some naïve conceptualization of egocentric politics. I see that you are very passionate about this topic, but please try to understand that simply because some reasoning may be used to justify something bad (even often), does not rob it of validity in all cases. :) That’s awesome man. Did you delete your accounts or just the applications?  Maybe trick yourself into merging the two? I follow pages I enjoy on my work IG and that kind of helps, seeing the different stuff. Also I won’t let myself go on my personal page until after I post on work. 
I’m sure these are things you do/have done. It’s kind of the same stuff always, applied to different areas of life when it comes to ADHD “tricks for good habits”. 
 lol Half the time seeing the envelope fills me with dread and terrible social anxiety 😣 I keep notifications *off* for the majority of stuff online. You can also make a new account just for messenger and add only the people you need to communicate with. Then never bother with actual Facebook again - http://messenger.com is the web interface, and you can use Messenger (or better, Messenger Lite) on your phone. I don't think it'd work for me, but [Chronos](https://wearchronos.com) allows you to add some functionality to an analog watch. thanks fellow "sochead" haha that would be sweet, i'm having trouble starting it and it's due in a few days!  Accounts, apps, everything. For FB it takes two weeks. And they keep reminding you. Which is annoying. This mostly happens to me after breaking my rule about not posting in political threads... Getting 1-2 envelopes is usually fine but more than that I just assume I have said something stupid.  It causes anxiety because I expect negative reactions on what I write.

I have never found a karma system to actually work. It is always used to downvote based on opinion. Only rarely I get points for being useful.  Thanks! I think Chronos is an awesome idea, but being able to see the message at a glance is what I think helps streamline my day. It's wonderful, but it also keeps me from wearing any other watch. Oh well!  I'm sorry that I haven't had any time to dig through articles. I'd recommend checking out Burt's "structural holes", studying how information is communicated within networks, and then thinking about how the *nature* of social media mediates or moderates those exchanges -> the impact on social structure, power, authority, and so on. You could even look at how the technology itself affects these things. As a quick example, many people do not have access to social media because they cannot afford technology or services to do so. What impact might that create on making and keeping friends, finding work, or mental health? Another interesting jumping off point might be how we use the word "friends" - what are the attitudes and conventions and norms surrounding how we use the word when it comes to social media, perhaps in opposition to regular usage?

HTH Ha! Me too... I’ll occasionally do so and regret once I see that someone has replied.  that's brilliant as an outline and overall argument, cheers
