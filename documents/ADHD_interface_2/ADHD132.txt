I've lost my doormat. My dog likes to sit on the mat I keep by my back door, so I brought it with me to his obedience class last night. I remember putting the mat back in my bag after class. I remember putting the bag in the car. I remember dropping the bag in the garage before taking the dog for a walk. I remember putting the empty bag away. 

I looked all over the garage, the house, the car, and I have no freaking clue where the doormat went.

I have lost many things. I have never before lost a doormat.

tl/dr: who the fuck loses a doormat?!?


Edit: Found it! I put the bag in the front seat of the car when I was looking for a flashlight for walking the dog. Saw the title on my front-page and already knew which subreddit this was.  > tl/dr: who the fuck loses a doormat?!? 

OMG!! i lost my shit here. 

i can't even count the number of times i've lost or fucked up things that no normal human would even have. "i have a flat on my unicycle, does anyone know where to get the right size tube" seems like a question that should never be asked...  I lost my hat day before yesterday, hoping it turns up.  I sometimes lose things while I (think I) have them in my hands. Sometimes I go around in a small circle, displacing stuff because I remember that thing I had to do with the other thing after I move this third thing.

My best move so far: while I was reading a few pages of an actual book about ADHD, I remembered I wanted to put my contacts lenses in, and after doing that I remembered something I wanted to write down. Later after reading for maybe 30 minutes I go out to pee only to find my contact container open (still containing the lenses) and the contact lens solution bottle without the lid. Sounds similar to what I did. Got weather mats for my new car and when changing them out with the carpet mats, I put one of the carpeted mats on the top of my car. When I finished i looked all over for that damn mat..... looked under the car, looked inside the recycle bin, everywhere! Finally my parents came out and right away said “it’s on top of the car”. I spent probably 10 minutes looking for it. 😂  I love this. I've misplaced so many random things, and I think I've been worse about it in the last few months.  I often lose my sleep mask and find it on my head. I hope it was ok to laugh when reading your post. I could judt relate so much. Glad you found your doormat! Whenever I lose a credit card, I dread people's reactions at the store or restaurant when I ask about it. Everyone gets all panicked and is super worried for me. Last time I finally told the person not to worry, this happens all the time. It's somewhere.

What's crazy is that I even have rules about where to put it -- either in my wallet or a certain pocket in my purse -- and yet I still lose it. I lose my drivers' license every few years, too. I once had a total spaz about not being able to find my sunglasses. My boyfriend at the time came downstairs to see what the fuss was about and pointed out that they were on my head 🤦🏻‍♀️.  Usually when I lose my shit I don't even bother looking for them 😂 Sooner or later it's bound to turn up, so I let it slide until I find it. Once in a period of 2 weeks I lost my card 3 times, my phone twice, keys twice, passport once and headphones twice, found them all every time.

Although recently I can't find my headphones and my bluetooth speaker and it's been a month since I've been waiting/looking :/

May every lost item turn up in the time of need! I misplace things so often... Super annoying when it comes to a project requiring tools. "I just set that screwdriver down TEN seconds ago, where the... Did it get carried off by aliens?! Oh. There it is in my pocket. Da fuq?!" > tl/dr: who the fuck loses a doormat?!?

I mean, I managed to break my arm playing football (the real one, not handegg). While I was still at school on NUMEROUS occasions I have done the following. School finishes, walk outside holding my books walk past my bag to the car and then remember I forgot my bag. Yeah, I can remember one time... leaving $40 of chicken on top of a freezer in the garage just after unloading groceries.  These things happen. My boyfriend lost the prescription for his ADHD medication. After he found it again, we both laughed about the irony.  It’s gone to lost. If your lost is full maybe something else you’ve been missing will pop up. That’s usually how it works for me. 

Can’t find my left shoe but I did find my harmonica I misplaced 5 months ago.  My hat has been missing for little over a week now. I'm sure it'll turn up, as usual. I lost my S Pen for my Galaxy Note 8 phone. I wasn't sure where it goes. Naturally I ordered a new replacement of S Pen through Amazon. Two weeks later, the original S Pen that I lost was on the kitchen floor in the corner..... Whelps I have a backup pen just in case. Ooph, I can relate. Last time I went to the bank to ask for a contactless the lady checking my details was surprised how many times I managed to lose my card, lol

I don't think any of my cards had a chance to expire yet.
 i keep like 6 active cards cause i misplace about one a week Almost as bad as forgetting to take meds that improve your memory.

Or not being able to see your glasses. is it an "us" specific thing that we buy the most random shit known to man? I have a freaking unicycle. i dont know how to ride a unicycle and probably never will. 

&#x200B; I misread that as cat, oh no. 

I do hope your hat turns up quicker than ever though. <3 Yes.  A missing pet would be a nightmare! 

I very rarely panic over missing possessions, one learns from experience etc. Thanks for the thoughts & positive vibes! <3
