What is your hobby? I have tried everything but dont seem to find anything fun enough to continue doing it. 

What do you guys do as a hobby?  I’m a musician, I’ve been playing trombone for nine years and tuba for three. It’s kind of like driving for me because I can’t seem to get distracted from it or let my mind wander since I have to concentrate on so many things at once (pitch, tone, moving my arm/fingers, reading music, counting in my head, watch the conductor, accents, volume). I probably have way too many hobbies.  

But the ones that stuck over time are like:   
**Computer Science**  
Mostly programming, I also made my hobby to my professional career  
**Music**  
Playing a bit of Ukulele and Piano  
**Pen and Paper RPGs/Boardgames**  
When I have the chance I easily get into complex games for like 10 hours straight.  
**Writing**  
I love making up things and writing them down. At some point I want to write like a book that mixes reality and the unique view from someone with ADHD into a fascinating story.  
**Game Development**  
Creating games is another fun way to let loose my imagination and make it come alive.  
**Pets**  
I love animals! I have two lovely cats from the shelter with me and I couldn't live without any sort of animal around me. I like music, I play drums, a little bit of piano and I bought a melodica a few months ago. I listen to many types of music.  I join a band a few weeks ago.

I like to play games, seeing my friends and family, listen to youtube videos, reading books and I like computer stuff, I made this into a carrer.

I would like to learn a new language, I speak French and English and would like to add German  as a 3rd language. Aerial silks. It’s a great full body workout and helps with my endorphins levels. I also never get bored...every time I master a move there’s 500 more to learn.  Magic the Gathering. I'm a bellydancer, I write fanfic/fandom stuff, avid reader, weightlifting. I let things go on in waves, and if that wave doesn't return, that's okay. Puzzles. Jigsaw puzzles, crossword puzzles, sudoku, kakuro, Rubik's cubes--I love them all. They're the perfect challenges, usually aesthetically pleasing, and fun to try to figure out. I've also constructed a few of my own puzzles and am looking into making them professionally.

Web design is also something I'm working on, since it's something that would look really good to employers in my discipline. I like home automation, ai, polymer clay sculpting, beading, weaving, sewing, spinning, knitting, crocheting, felting, silver smithing, graphic design, dog training, fancy rat training (ever saw a rat running a tiny agility course?! So cute), gardening (especially subtropical edible perennials), cooking, preserving, fermenting, making soap, making lamps, special effects makeup, and web design. 

I'm probably leaving something out. Mostly, I just really love **making** in general. I like taking *nothing* and creating *something.* There's just something super happy-making for me to look at something and know that it exists because of me. Oh shit, that's probably why I have three kids...

ETA: Piano, clarinet, and learning new instruments. 

Also, my daughter never really loved anything until recently, and we really tried to find anything she could find pride and joy in. She's finally discovered piano (after numerous tries to get her to take interest), and painting (once I introduced her to artists like Picaso to convince her that finding her own style is the name of the game). Disc golf. I get there exercise that allows me to be unmedicated, it's nature, and I can take my dog. 

Fine something with a lot of exercise. It helps my symptoms a lot. > I probably have way too many hobbies.

There's no such thing. It just tells me you enjoy the simpler things in life. That's a great quality to have. Hey man! What up! I was about to say Magic: The Gathering too thinking I'd be the only one! What format do you play? I lean towards EDH/Commander and have a dedicated playgroup that gets together every week or at least we try too. But I've also dabbled in drafting but sometimes the LGS is just too intimidating. 

What about Magic do you like? 

For me, it's all about deckbuilding. I like making things or trying to do different things that I don't think have been done in the game yet. And there's also the organization aspect of it. There's something about just sitting down and organizing all my cards that fools my brain into thinking that I have my life together for like an hour. Girlfriend can't stand it though especially when I snap out of my hyper focus trance and there's just piles of cards everywhere. 

But anyway, cool dude! Didn't think anyone would have said Magic. I play pretty exclusively modern, and do it online a lot.

I like how it can always be new. It’s also a good escape.  I do brew a lot and I’ve had people write about my brews. I do get the hyper focus thing going from time to time .

Cool to find someone else into it!
