ADHD Summer Reading Challenge! Hey guys! So this idea popped into my head during a lecture (classic), but I was thinking about how I haven't truly read a book front to cover since I was 13 (so about seven years ago), and how there are plenty of books that I /am/ honestly interested in reading. So I thought I would challenge myself this summer to pick a book and finish it before September. This is a /lot/ of time for one book, but I know that there will be days where I can only get a few pages read. If I do get one finished, I think I'll try and fit one more in! Obviously, if you just don't like to read, this challenge isn't for you, but I know there are a few of us who would /like/ to read, it's just difficult to commit. 

So! Anyone want to join? I thought maybe we could write our choice here, and keep each other updated! Or even start a little facebook group or something. Of course, just an idea. 

TL;DR: Challenge to read a book front to cover over the summer. Any takers?  I will do it Just a reminder, there's a [Goodreads group!](https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/583178-adhd-book-club) :D 

/u/thecuddlykrab /u/patmeonthebacksnail u/kingblaike I'm in! I bought a couple of book earlier this year that I was super interested in and meant to read.. but have been sitting on a shelf. Good opportunity to finally dedicated time to read them.  You should try audible. It still counts as reading! But I understand if you rather do it the traditional way. 

Once I accidently skipped over a novel from a book series; I realised this while reading the sequel prematurely. Instead of going through the trouble of waiting for the previous book to be delivered to me, I decided to just get the audiobook. **I'm such a klutz ₍₍ (ง Ŏ౪Ŏ)ว ⁾⁾** It's a great idea! Might be worth actually coming up with a specific title, to mimic a sort of book club? I know I'd have more motivation to finish a book if I knew I'd have to discuss it! I’m in! I started The Hobbit like a month ago and am hardly in chapter 3 I'm in! I'm on board, I read quite a lot, but I'd like to go back to the times where I used to read multiple books a week! :D What book will you be reading? Just curious :) So I kind of have done this in an App called https://www.goodreads.com/ it is integrated with Kindle App, & Audible (all owned by Amazon). I suggest GoodReads cause you make a book club. I make a challenge for myself to read a minimum of 12 books a year, but I tend to read some heavy books on deep subjects. That way we could share books we are reading or interested in. The App allows you to save books you want to read, would like to read, or read (past tense). That way you can see & feel the reward of saying you finished it, & show the growth over time.   That’s awesome, I started the same challenge last year , the first few days I couldn’t get through five minutes, and definitely skipped a few days sometimes weeks but now I build a habit of reading at least an hour a day , book clubs and subreddits of the book are awesome tools for accountability and motivation  I'm in!! Totally In! Great idea! I listen to Audible CONSTANTLY...Been listening to podcasts in my car for years now because it calms me during the commute.
I'll be reading Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination! u/ennaxor89 u/constantspacecadet u/schmexy_lexi Definitely! I think it could be really fun to have an ADHD book club. We don't all have to read the same book because that's boring, but we can chat about progress and give a little review when we finish!  Yes, I second this, Goodreads is super easy to navigate and making an ADHD group with select members wouldn't be too difficult! u/aprellevie u/gorillazkingltd u/kingraph1111 Thanks!!! u/unsanitarydemon u/mistermakeshift
