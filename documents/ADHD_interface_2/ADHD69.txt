I'm hyperfocusing on Neopets again. I've spent real money I don't have on this game... Again. I've literally spent my entire workday buying petpets. I'm aware that I'm hyperfocusing & it may become a problem but it's so much fun. Plus I got some stressful news that I'd rather avoid so... You know how that goes.

Someone help me learn to enjoy things in moderation please. Oh man, Neopets is still a thing??? Oh no, I wish I didn't have this information... I wish I could help but for a moment I wondered if I didn't post this myself..

Take solace that you're not alone? I’m new here but I was diagnosed as a child and haven’t been taking meds or seeing anyone for many years. Is this something that happens a lot to you? I sometimes get lost in a video game or something dumb for hours on end, thinking only a few minutes go by. I just want to know if there’s something to help My best solution is to hyperfocus on the best next not as dmging (rip wallet) thing u can.
A new addicitve phone app. Personally i changed mine to reading light novels on my phone. They were just so consumable and easy to go through and devour. And there aint no microtransations ads or ajything to annoy me or cost me other then still procrasinating on what i should be doing

But hey its better then what it was doin earlier Honestly I think 90% of us still on Neopets are hyper focusing and avoiding life.

* Maybe not at work. I mean, it's probably allowed but unless work has outside distractions and quotas and you have legit nothing to do it can get distracting. 
* Alternatively Google will set an alarm or timer since IT probably won't allow block this expect on breaks software. 
* Wallet far far away from computer. Do not save credit card info to it. 
* JellyNeo and /r/Neopets guides are good for finding things
* DO NOT get into real world cash item trading aka NC clothes. Bad.  Lay off the Adderal dude. It's still a thing & it's glorious.

Did you ever play the Oregon Trail in school? They made it a handheld console. They also bought Tamagotchis back. I definitely paid real money I don't have for both of those things. Nostalgia is kicking my ass, yo. It happens all of the time. I'm normally able to snap out of it & I think that's because I try to practice mindfulness, I take my meds & I have my boyfriend to talk to about it. We've discussed my hyperfocus & he's very good about reminding me about my actual responsibilities.

But when I'm off my meds or not eating properly or not sleeping properly or stressed af (& I am/am doing all of those things right now) it all goes out of the window & I spend 6 hours on Neopets overnight.

Funny story: this one time in high school during a manic episode I became obsessed with the Sims 3 & regularly skipped school to play all damn day. There was one week where I just didn't go to school at all. I strongly suspect my ADHD had something to do with it. This is very good advice, thank you! The only challenge is forcing my brain to think that reading is as fun as playing Neopets. Neopets isn't secure so after one transaction I figured I'd better stop. So there goes spending real money, at least. Don't give unsolicited medical advice to strangers, dude. If you want to hear it in a different way: Tell your Adhd Specialist that you are obsessing over a game and that you are making debt in the process and therefore ask them to adjust or reevaluate treatment for you or give you counseling since this truly sounds like "Ocd" amplified by stimulant (treatment).
