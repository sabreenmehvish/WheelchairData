I'm supposed to be reading For the past hour and a half, I've been *trying* to read chapters for my finance class to get caught up.

I've read probably a total of three pages, and that's being generous. I've skimmed over the equations and some definitions. I've spent the rest of the time on reddit. 

It physically hurts me and almost makes me feel kinda nauseous trying to make myself read, even though I know I need to. Does anybody else feel this way? I'm out of meds for the next couple weeks and coffee only makes me sleepy.

tl;dr Been trying to read for an hour and a half, only read maybe 2-3 pages and can't stay off reddit. I feel the same way, I have just read an interesting article about feeling the pain don't try and push it away just sit with it and acknowledge it. Apparently to heal you need to go through it. What helped me when I was anxious was saying to myself thank you anxiety for showing up but I'm not in danger I'm safe. Apparently it's a flight or fight mechanism and your brain had been trained to recognise studying as danger like a cave man seeing a lion. Sorry im rambling I'm not sure if this is much help.  I’ve got to read 6 chapters of Frankenstein for my homework. Granted I’ve got nearly two weeks to do it but we all know I’m gonna leave it till last minute I tried reading off meds yesterday, my efforts were fruitless. I'd say try to get your meds as soon as possible and then begin to binge read. Taking small breaks in between pages is okay, but you don't want to be racing to finish in order to receive your break, or else you end up not really reading it. I honestly just can't read a book when I'm off my meds.
