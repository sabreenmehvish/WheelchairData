Reading issues (language learning) I am a 24 year old student living in sweden and I recently found out about my ADD. I started studying 4 years ago when I moved to sweden and before that I couldn't study. So it was hard to notice the ADD-related issues I've been having as they weren't having such a big impact on my life. I have had my ways around them.
But now that I am studying in sweden I need to pass the Swedish language courses as it is (obviously) one of the main courses. I have no issue with grammar and vocabulary or anything that requires learning some sort of instruction or memorizing words. That's how I passed Swedish course 1 but the 2nd course has a part where I need to read a chapter of a specific book every week and have a discussion about it with a group of students. 
I have dropped 2 educational periods because of that and cannot do the reading no matter how hard I try. It's a 3 month course and I do not have the time nor the energy to spend 2-4 hours on each page everyday to somewhat know what I've read, till I'm done with the book .
If anyone here have had the same problem and has any advice I would truly appreciate your help. (Sorry for bad writing)
