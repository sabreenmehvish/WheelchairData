What symptoms have you been able to solve with technology, and how? As it says in the title, what symptoms have you been able to solve with technology, and how?

This could be a mobile app, task manager, VR/AR, IoT, Smart mirror, Google assistant, whatever you got. I find Google home to help me remember things and that Personally Electronic toothbrushes and a Fitbit. 

I always forget to brush my teeth and only brush for like 20 seconds. With an electric toothbrush it’ll automatically turn off after 2 minutes so I’ll just browse on reddit till it’s done. 

Fitbits tell you to get up after a while to walk a small 20-40 steps and just in general stops me from laying in bed all day. Also they show calls, texts, and events .

And as dumb as they are I love a good fidget spinner/cube.  Google calendar, google keep and OneNote are your friends Smart assistants! I have an Amazon Echo Dot, because it was cheap. 

**Timers:** I don't forget things when I'm cooking now, so I haven't burned anything in ages. I can also set many different named timers at once.

**"Alexa, remember this":**  I can tell Alexa to remember random shit now. I lost my engagement ring weeks ago. Finally asked Alexa where I put it on a whim. Turns out I had actually told her to remember where I was putting it, so she told me. I've also had her remember things like my son's teachers' and doctors' names.

**Reminders:** I can have her remind just once about something, or I can set a recurring reminder.

**Routines:** Alexa has a routines feature that's mostly for smart home stuff, but I also use it for other things. The Alarmy app is usually enough to wake everyone up, but crap happens, so I have a routine set up to run in the mornings after everyone *should* be up as kind of a fail-safe. Volume is set to max, she yells at everyone for a couple minutes, and then starts looping fog horns, which creeps us all out. Nothing like waking up to the sound of impending doom to get your ass in gear.

**Lists!:** I hated the lists features until they fixed them recently so that I don't have to use the app to update, so now I'm using them more. I find it easier to keep up with a to-do list via Alexa than on paper when I'm actually busy doing stuff.

I dislike the idea of having a tiny spy in my house, and that she doesn't work without internet, but I'm seeing way more pros than cons for now. This! Having a google home mini to yell at whenever for the time, events, and traffic is a life saver.  Ikr
