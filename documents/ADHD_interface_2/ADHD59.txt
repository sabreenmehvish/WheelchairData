Reading books will be the bane of my existence I can never be able to read a book fluidly ever in my life. I’m just so frustrated. I need to read this 50 page book for homework. It’s doable. If I read 10 pages an hour, i could finish in 5 hours, which doesn’t sound like a lot at all. But I’ve been sitting here for 45 minutes, reading and re-reading and struggling to get this information into my head and to remember what I had just read, but i CANT. I’ve read four pages, comprehending the information somewhat. I’m really trying, but I just can’t do this. It’s frustrating. Hey i did a course that helped. 

They taught speed reading - doesn't help memory but helps you find important points 

Then they taught mind maps - take the important points and concept map them any way you like. This helps me remember because my brain ain't straight! 

I use maps now for loads of things (i use simple mind app)

And i love reading! 

The other hint i have seen is to put it in the online text to voice and listen to it while doing other things or taking notes.  Go for time rather than pages.  Use the Pomodoro Technique with a much shorter time frame like 7 minutes reading to 3 screwing around on reddit or whatever.  See if that helps.

If it doesn't, you can try starting to outline while you're reading.  It doesn't need to be pretty, but writing things down by hand engages different parts of your brain and it might help you retain some more of the information.  Don't worry how long it's all going to take.  It's gonna be tomorrow at some point whether you do the assignment or not.  Wouldn't you be happier in the morning with the assignment done or at least worked on? Give your self a reward after a certain amount of pages. Me being a weirdo who loves exercise reads 3 pages and then does 30 push ups. Just pick something quick and easy like a piece of chocolate not something like an episode of a programme cos then you’ll never start reading again.
