Breaking the mold of previous reading habits without getting frustrated? Since I've now been on Adderall for approximately two months, I'm more aware of my reading habits, or lack thereof. For the past 15 years or so, I was never conscious of the fact that I skimmed books, articles, facts, etc without actually reading from beginning to end. English classes in HS basically consisted of Sparknotes and/or Youtube videos since I didn't have the discipline to actually read the entire book for class. 

Since being on this medication makes me more self aware, I spoke with my therapist about how I can break this mold. He suggested taking more time in a very quiet environment and slowly read. He also suggested having a notepad/paper and write down notes/main points of whatever it is you're reading about.

While I think this is a good idea, I keep getting pissed off and frustrated with myself that I just skipped a paragraph thirty seconds ago and have to go back. It's so frustrating that I, in a way, have to re-learn how to read and this is going to take time. I think part of me is frustrated too that I feel dumb or inferior for having to deal with this while other people (NT if you will) have no issues and naturally allocate attention towards reading.

Does anyone have any advice for being more patient and calm so that you can focus on reading more?
