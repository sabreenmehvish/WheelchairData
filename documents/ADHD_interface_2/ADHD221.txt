I love reading through this subreddit, but I usually forget to come here for weeks/months at a time This is one of my 5 bookmarked subs on mobile, so I see it every time I open Reddit. I always say I'm going to check it when I get home from work, but I haven't been here in three months. It pretty much sums up my entire life For me it's the opposite. I love this community and love the support. I lurk all over reddit, but this is one of the only subreddits I am actually active in.
