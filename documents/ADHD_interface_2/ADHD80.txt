Advice for reading dense textbook? Hi all,

I’ve managed to get through college 20 years ago, I accepted that it took me way longer to read the material than my peers.   I did seem to end up with a better understanding!

Well, I’m back in college and now I have more responsibilities and don’t have unlimited time to read.   

Does anyone have tips to read a little faster and stay on track?  I spent almost 9 hours on 50 pages - very small print, I take notes as I read, dogs and toddler interrupted a lot - so not all 9 hours were reading.   I do try to study at the library, but that’s not possible on the weekend. 

Thanks in advance for any tips!
 I find that if I can both see and hear the text I can focus a bit better/catch myself faster when my attention wanders, so I get as many of the readings I can as PDF's and then load them into a text-to-speech app. Many of them let you highlight text and add notes and have the ability to export your notes/highlights if that is something that is helpful to you. Right now I am using Voice Dream Reader, and it's OK so far, but doesn't seem to like scanned documents :(

Check your school's accessibility centre, they likely provide a free text-to-speech software download. My school uses Read & Write Gold. (I tried it and didn't like it because I couldn't figure it out immediately, but it might work for others)

&#x200B; This sounds good.   I’ve thought that hearing it would be better, too.   I have a traditional paper book right now. Oh man, I feel you. Two of my books are paper as well. I have been ...not reading them.
