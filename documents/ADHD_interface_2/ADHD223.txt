The specifics of how mindfulness meditation works if you have ADHD **The theory**

Most of you have probably read that ADHD is likely caused by the [pre-frontal cortex being less active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Brain_structure). Some of you may have read that mindfulness meditation was shown to [boost activity in the pre-frontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_activity_and_meditation#Topographical_findings). Great, right? But *how* does it work and what does it feel like?

It's assumed that we ADHDers have poor working memory, and that's what causes our executive functions problems. But I found it more to be like imagine having dozens of tabs open in a browser: even if you have as much RAM as another person, if they only have a couple of tabs open, your computer will feel sluggish compared to theirs. Yet you can't just close the tabs, they're like popup ads, you close one and 10 more pop up!

**The practice**

The solution: train the brain to develop a popup blocker, and how to bookmark the interesting ones for later.

You pick a convenient, neutral object of focus, such as the breath, and you start focusing on it. Whenever you notice a thought popping up, you go back to thinking about the breath.

Don't expect to run a marathon on your first jog! When I started meditating, I couldn't go even a single inhalation before my mind would wonder off and I would completely forget about the breath, sometimes for minutes at a time. That is perfectly normal for people with ADHD, consider it bonus practice!

And be kind to yourself, it's much more effective that way. Think of training your dog to come when you call him: if you scold him and yell at him for having run off, he only understands "I come here and get yelled at, I was better off staying away". Yet if you praise him when he finally does come, he thinks "oh, I should have come here sooner, I get nice belly rubs!".

And find little moments to practice it in daily life. Every time you catch yourself focusing on something different than what you intend to, redirect yourself.

**The effect**

After practicing daily for a while, you'll realize that it's been several breaths and you didn't get lost in thought! Of course you'll get so excited you lose track of it again, but that's fine. It'll get even better.

You'll notice that you're more productive in daily life, too. Instead of dwelling on what if you fail an exam or how your boss may not like your work, you actually direct more mental energy to actually studying or working. Just like how exercising makes it easier to carry the groceries and all other physical tasks, a good meditation workout helps with daily mental tasks!

Fun becomes more fun too! Instead of dwelling on all the tasks you've yet to do, how the kitchen is still messy, you trust yourself to be better able to focus on it tomorrow, so you are more inclined to allow yourself to fully relax and focus on that video game or movie.

**Disclaimer**

This is largely anecdotal, but it does seem to be the experience of most people, with countless studies to back it up, both psychological and neurological.

I also found it more effective to practice mindfulness *with* medication. I dabbled in it before my diagnosis too, but progress was slower, and, because I didn't fully understand how it works, I would get discouraged and quit. I believe it is doable without meds too, though it may take longer.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about this, and I'd love to hear your experiences! You are freaking wonderful, /u/scatterbrain2015! I really appreciate hearing from someone with a similar experience to my own! (Although, I admit to having quite a bit of trouble reading all those paragraphs.)

Meditation has been both a boon and bane to my daily life as I've practiced it on and off for a year now. On the positive end, I've seen some significant progress in my engagement with the present, and have finally gained traction in making meditation habitual.

On the flip side, the ADHD-anxiety one-two punch still frequently gives me a run for my money. I set myself up with unrealistic expectations, then struggle painfully when my meditation practice isn't up to snuff. For a while, I really beat myself up over lack of success.

Slowly, I've been tempering my patience with the knowledge that meditation *should* be particularly difficult for me--for the same reasons, I need meditation all the more!

Currently, I'm looking for ways to better tailor meditation practices to my needs. Some things I'm trying:
* Breaking up meditations into two or three parts with 1-2 minutes of mind wandering in between.
* Stimulating the brain with repeated movement to decrease distraction
* Sensory stimulation, mostly scented candles and white noise (eg. a fan)
* "Meditating" (practicing mindfulness) while walking
* Trying meditation after excercise, with a cool down period to allow heart rate to settle
*I've used guided meditations using the apps Headspace, Pacifica, and Fabulous. I've had the most success with the latter, but all three provide great guided meditations. The voice helps me focus and mitigates some the anxiety of silence.

Thanks again for sharing! I'd love to hear your thoughts! I'd love even more to see more people on this thread... I would recommend re-thinking what "success" while meditating is.

Every time you stop your mind from wondering, you are succeeding!

In that way, it's easier when you have ADHD, because it gives you plenty of opportunities to bring the mind back to the breath :)

Remember to thank your mind whenever it tells you it's been distracted. Welcoming it back to the breath with open arms works better than bashing it for having gotten distracted.

It takes time. A lot of time. But just doing this, nothing else, is all you need to do.

Good luck, and don't give up! Just read this and laughed for not having thought of it that way myself! It's simple, it makes sense, and yet that's so far from my gut instincts.

Yeah, I can do that! Thank you.
