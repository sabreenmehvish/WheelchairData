Reading is hard I know we all have that issue of having to reread paragraphs over and over, but does anyone also read at lightning speed by just skimming everything over and just reading the important parts? I used to get in trouble in school because I'd skim over the instructions and miss all the details, and when I'm reading a book, I skim or completely skim over all of the sentences and paragraphs describing something since it usually doesn't have any extremely important info. I end up reading something references a past part in the book that I skipped over because my brain didn't see it as important, and it's extremely frustrating.

tl;dr reading is hard with adhd because my brain won't chill out lmao I had exact same issue with reading until I was prescribed stimulants. Now I can read like a mother f@*+er. I can also comprehend much better. No more skimming and rereading for me.  All the time. I used to love reading, but I cant get myself to read anymore. Ended up having to listen to audiobooks instead. Even with audiobooks I have to rewind 30 seconds, because I miss stuff all the time. Skimmed this post ! But I still got the gist of it. Frustrating. It’s a shame nobody can see me read from inside my head, because then they’d understand what I mean when I say I have trouble reading.  I tend to scan and not able process anything, can't seem to slow down, if I do I feel Boredom Pain or panic. I literally cannot focus on reading on anything unless it’s absolutely necessary. Even then I have to reread over and over again because I cannot comprehend what my brain just skimmed over. It’s so frustrating.  I lose train of thought in 10 seconds anyway lol Man if I had any doubts about having ADHD before I don't anymore, this is me exactly. Most of it is me being paranoid I think: I'm so worried about absorbing every word that I end up rereading it unnecessarily
