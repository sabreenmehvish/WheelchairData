Help with reading for pleasure Hello all, 

This will be a bit of an unusual post and I might post it In a literary sub as well
 
While I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist many years ago while I was in grad school ( I just had too much on my plate and needed help to get it all done - talking 110 hours of work per week ), I don't think I have adhd. I can function well, go to work , stay on top of deadlines and power through hard tasks with tea/energy drinks. 
But here's the deal, I used to love reading for pleasure as a teenager. But now I can't muster the mental energy to do so. I just can't start. I find myself in front of Netflix and my computer and I can't be bothered to read. When I read, I get so distracted I think of a million things and don't enjoy the story. I know many of you will say this may be depression but it's not , j totally enjoy other hobbies in life like horse riding, walking , cooking, etc... I just don't know what happened.  I blame it on too much technology and maybe a few personal circumstances ( moving to a different city by myself and feeling alone some evenings, so maybe I feel like  reading makes me feel more alone subconsciously- as opposed to Instagram or reddit. And having no one to discuss the reading with. In high school and college you have groups to share your insights with) I joined a book club, but it's not getting better... I know that if I took an adderall I would power through a book quickly, but I really don't want to me on medicine just for reading and for personal reasons. I don't judge those who take it at all, but I haven't touched in in 4 years and I feel healthy. So that's not a solution for me. 
I'm wondering if this ever happened to any of you, why, and how you over came it... 
Thanks!  Reading is hard. Words jumble together, I have to run over the same sentence several times to get it, and the stimulation is too low so I lose focus. I obviously *can* read, but it's not efficient.

Listening to audiobooks is much more natural for me. I spend about 45 minutes a day listening to audiobooks while taking a walk (it's important for me to give my body something to do while listening), and while I have to rewind semi-frequently I get through way more content. Text-to-speech programs work similarly. I‚Äôve recently experienced the exact same thing. I‚Äôve been taking Adderall or Ritalin for the past decade and wanted to wean myself off because my husband and IÔ∏è are thinking about having children.  (IÔ∏è worry about depression if I needed to stop taking it all at once) 
Since lowering my dosage and not regularly taking it, I find that I have to force myself to read. IÔ∏è have always loved to read, So it‚Äôs frustrating to struggle with this now. IÔ∏è don‚Äôt have any answers for you, but just wanted to offer my own experience.  I left advice in a similar, but more specific thread a while back. If you ignore the specific book suggestions and examples at the end, it think it‚Äôs relevant?

Summary: be very picky about the books you choose to read. You can want to want to read a book, but its not the same as genuinely wanting to read it, no matter the reason.

- i did a speed reading course. Taught me to skim like i wanted to, finding the point when i get impatient 

- sort of ruined pleasure reading for a while

- i use kindle on phone because nightmode

- for 2 years i only read/skimmed self-help and philosophy kind of books. With permission not to study/try to remember them. The idea was they would soak in somewhere and that was better than netflix (i also banned myself from watching any crime/murder/violent things)
- results was more sleep because yawn. (Ps i dont remember them but i can drop names in convos sometimes!)

- now i read ‚Äúbubblegum‚Äù everynight to sleep, but its trash novels that i still skim bits of because im not a huge fan of landscape descriptions etc
- i read ‚Äúgood books‚Äù in the morn with coffee so i maybe get something out of them.

- results:  I know i cant focus then either but i have a system where i take note of things i think/want to research for later (during random times of the day i end up looking that stuff up) rather than drifting while reading

- and i am getting slightly everso slightly better at reading for pleasure. Two or three books this year where i have read landscapes or other visual things and enjoyed the language. 

Persist i think?! Thank you hun! It's great to see I'm not the only one. And good job weaning yourself off. I support both medicated and unmedicated people. I know how hard it is to come off :) let me know if you find something that works.   Yes , great advice. Just getting started and finishing are important. Doesnt matter how long it takes . I think reading in general is disappearing, so perhaps what we experience is a generational issue. Thanks ! Thank youüòä and will do!  Also, please let me know if you find something that works or makes a difference! True. That being said i love meme language and get it totally, so cross-generational brain?
