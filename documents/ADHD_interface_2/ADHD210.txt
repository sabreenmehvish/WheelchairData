What are your current hobbies? I almost titled this "What is your current hobby?" but then I thought better of it. 

Right now I'm really into learning Spanish (again). It isn't quite to the point where it's consuming every waking moment of my day, but it's getting there. I'm trying to teach myself moderation while aggressively pursuing my language acquisition. I got a promotion & now I work at a predominantly Latino & Spanish-speaking school. Not being bilingual is really inhibiting my ability to interact with students & parents.

I just realized that got a little off track. Anyway, what's your thing right now? How long have you been doing it? Why are you doing it? Tell me (us) about it! Iâ€™ve been taking improv classes. Its to help with my social anxiety and I can put my random mind to use.  Music I'm almost done with my goal of reading 52 books in 2018, I take aikido (a martial art) and I meditate. I want to say camping, but I've only gone once since getting all the gear (the weather has not been cooperative and I have a six month old child), but I really enjoyed it and plan to go again in the near future.

Recently quit studying Spanish and teaching myself to program.  Considering taking up shooting and origami. Have always wanted to take up scuba, but I honestly don't think it's going to happen :( Babysitting, the new Spiderman PS4 game, figuring out how to organize my room, reading up on ADHD psych Learning after effects and play with settings and stuff. Also boosted board and try to socialize but not quite there yet haha I like to play guitar, drums, video games, music production, and programming.  Spider-Man for me too. The weekend I got it I completed it to over 50%, then I forgot about it but now Iâ€™m hooked again.  Iâ€™m on my second time through it!! Itâ€™s so awesome!!! Most of my friends have Xboxâ€™s and cos Iâ€™ve just been talking about it all the time they get annoyed cos they canâ€™t play it. ðŸ˜‚
