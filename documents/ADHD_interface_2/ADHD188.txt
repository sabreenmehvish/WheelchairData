Win Wednesday 
# Let's Celebrate Our Victories

ADHD is a daily challenge. Sometimes it's hard to remember the positive and it can feel like things are rarely good. **We win every single day.**  We challenge you to write down your wins and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win.

**Examples from previous weeks:**

* Abstaining from binge drinking for 11 days. Keep it up!

* Worked to overcome their traumatic brain injury and had an awesome week.

* I successfully adulted today.

* I just got through 2 weeks of studying and finals and I did pretty good!

* This weekend I was diagnosed with ADD, and people keep telling me they're sorry -- but I'm ecstatic! 

* I just finished my bachelors degree.

 I sent out 12 job applications last week... so far i have two rejections and one employer who called me in the morning while i was asleep and left me a message telling me to call back, so i did, several times for several days but they never answered and left no email i could contact them on. So kind of a red flag for that company haha. But i also had a phone interview yesterday and they seemed to like me, they are going to tell me next week if i go through to a the next stage. Ahh, i really think i could have said some more things but i just get to nervous when talking on the phone, but i think it went pretty well anyways so i really hope i get that job!!! Trying to send out more this week. It's hard to keep the motivation up when you're unemployed, but i have to, so i'm just trying to stay positive! I managed to stfu at meeting today (1 week on med)

OMFG..

Just be able to hold my thought, rethink it and say it at more useful settings.

AWSM!!! so earlier this week I missed a shift at work because I wrote it down for a different day in my calendar... I was freaking out cuz my manager tends to be pretty strict.

Normally I kinda just avoid dealing with issues like this and then I forget to deal with it, but I texted my boss about it and went into work the next day and everything was fine and ahhhhh Finally got my car into the shop.
Haven't forgotten anything of importance since Saturday (I think)
Got my work related paperwork dealt with


But best of all, I think I've come up with a planning/task organization system that will really work! (If it does I'll post about it for you guys!) Finished 2 client videos, worked up the courage to defend my pricing to a client (its hard when you’re literally putting a money value on yourself) and got my car towed to the shop for repairs! 

Now I need to finish up 2 other projects, call about pricing on my new car and get ready for my work trip this weekend.   I've been feeling like an ADD imposter lately but had a huge moment yesterday. Diagnosed formally at 26. But it turns out symptoms of inattentive ADD have been present as early as 2nd grade. My parents told me about how, in elementary school, I was almost put in remedial classes because I didn't feel like doing schoolwork. However, when I was into a topic, I'd get amazing grades. 

Instead of being put in remedial classes, I was tested for the mentally gifted program. The results were shocking, I could actually read at a reading level way above my class and was pretty smart. Turns out I was just bored and had trouble focusing on mundane things long enough to succeed (my therapist said this is a classic sign). 

Problem is, the real world is full of boring things that must be done. And I need help from medication and therapy to get through it (and I have a long way to go). But still, it feels good to not feel like an imposter anymore.  its a total coincidence that its win wednesday, and today i woke up pumped to finally fold my laundry and put it away. Its a mountain of clean clothes covering my entire loveseat/couch. the problem is my bf wants to "help". So he'll put laundry in the washer and dryer, but i have to fold and put away. His part is easy! the machines do all the work! but folding and putting away is manual labour, and its literally painful for me to get through it. I know, folding through one full basket is a win, but it seems like i'm barely making a dent, and my basket is huge! so now, after 4 hrs of watching TV and folding, im still only 3/4 way through. Doesnt help that all the laundry is so weird, like some of my familys clothes who dont even live here anymore, hats, scarfs, mitts and socks that dont match, blankets i never used but were on the floor and somehow got dirty and cat hair gets on stuff if i leave it too long. hopefully i will have a win today but i can already feel my energy depleting.... -got laid off my internship but I'm taking two months to cope and get enough therapy and learn how to cope with ADHD so that's great! 

-read two articles today without being distracted 

-pole dancing has changed my life and I enjoy it so much because I feel so focused 

-slowly accepted my breakup and letting go I functioned well at work today and got lots done! I finally learned to use After Effect. I've been wanting for several months. I finally did it with a help of medication! So excited what I can make with this! Try to finish stats hw. have to sleep early so that I can squeeze in a few more things done tomorrow morrning.  I finished a quilt I started 5 years ago. In total it only took 6 daysin total in 2 lots of 3 day stretches (thank you hyperfocus!!). I'm really happy and can't wait to give it to me best friend for her daughter's first birthday.

[Finally done!](https://www.reddit.com/r/quilting/comments/9kyzor/i_just_want_to_thank_everyone_for_the_warm/?utm_source=reddit-android)

Also I have hopefully learned to successfully hyperlink in reddit. Day late, but the Mrs. was early for her doctor appointment today! I got an A on my paper. I got an extension since my laptop suddenly died, and I didn’t have it saved online (whoops) so yay!!
 I was just like you in regards to schoolwork! Super smart (evaluated at college level reading in 4th grade), struggled grades-wise because my classes were so dependent on doing homework. I hope that the people of our generation who became teachers won't put their students through the same BS. Hey stats is great! It's the only kind of math I like because it's SO FREAKIN USEFUL! Go HAM tomorrow  It looks amazing! :) I love getting blankets as gifts. I still have a quilt I got as a baby. It's stained, but I still have it in my closet.  will try my best. Thanks for the encouragement!
