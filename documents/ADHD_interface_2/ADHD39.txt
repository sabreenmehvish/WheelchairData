Will reading (novels, autobiographies) for fun, instead of watching netflix/using reddit/playing video games in my downtime, help me increase my concentration abilities, or lead me (a college student) to burning out since I have to read so much for school? So, i know leisure reading is much better for improving my attention span and concentration abilities than my other favorite downtime activities (netflix, reddit, video games). Increased attention span/concentration abilities can help me do better in school.    :)

On the other hand, perhaps it will lead me to burning out and will be too much reading for my brain to handle...since I am required to read a lot in many of my college classes.    :(

So, LOL....it might either help me or hurt me.  **What do you think?**

&#x200B; That really depends on you, I think. It might work for some people, and it might not. It's just something you'll have to try. And regardless of what you choose, you shouldn't spend the *majority* of your time reading. Even reading for pleasure *too much* can lead to burnout and exhaustion. You'll still need to pace yourself and give yourself breaks to relax and let your brain process what you've read. This is necessary both for pleasure reading and class assignments. I loved reading as a kid and quit in college. I had to read so much for classes that reading was the last thing I wanted to do in my down time. I did pick it back up after graduating. Everyone is different though.
