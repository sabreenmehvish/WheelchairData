Graduating with a Double Degree Soon! Been a hectic 8-9 years, but in a couple of weeks I find out if I graduate from University with a job waiting for me! 

Lot of stuff happened during that time including my father passing away, being booted out of university due to deteriorating mental health, feelings of shame, getting over said shame, traveling, community college, working, and obviously getting back into university.

You guys can do it. Keep trying!  Good for you!! Such an inspiration! You should be so proud of yourself!  How did you study?! It feels imposibld to me, i canmot fathom how other  people can sit down and focus on reading for just 45 min at a time?
Would you share some tecnics you have used?  AWESOME!  Do me a favor and take a moment to savor it and enjoy it, before you ruin it by over analyzing it and minimizing the awesomeness of this achievement.  I know it is a hard concept for people like us, but take a moment to live in the right now.  You worked your ass off for this.  You gave it your everything.  You likely sacrificed time with friends and family.  Now savor the significance of this accomplishment and the pure satisfaction and wholeness of what it feels like to stay with it until completion.

 I've been a hectic my whole life and it feels great to see people get shit done and not let ADHD cripple their lives but instead, live a life striving through ADHD. first time I've ever heard ADHD as a "hectic" too btw Are you me? This sounds super similar to what i've been doing. Congrats! As a fellow ADHD soon to be double degree graduate i know how tough it is and i'm proud that you're out there showing the rest of us that we can do it. CONGRATS! I’m in my 7th year of undergrad, it’s so nice to know that it IS possible! You are a true *~inspiration~*  It makes me happy to hear stuff like this. Congratulations! Thank you so much! I really appreciate it.  I graduated with a degree in biology this year and the key for me was medication and panic. The only way I made it through school was planned procrastination and avoiding studying at home at all costs. I would set aside like a whole day for what was essentially a couple hours of work. 

I’d jump back and forth between the library and coffee shops and had to trick myself into taking interest in whatever I was studying at the time. There are far more efficient methods but this usually worked for me. I needed to know I’d be able to relocate to another study spot and get a drink/snack in order to function. Oh and lots and lots of music, especially when in transit to the next location.  Okay so readings were the hardest part of my degree for me. Full disclosure I did a bachelor of science in information technology and a bachelor of business. I did most of my readings Sunday morning- following a modified version of cal newports Sunday morning ritual. [http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/09/26/follow-a-sunday-ritual/](http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/09/26/follow-a-sunday-ritual/)

Willpower is a finite resource, so i tried to get the readings done first thing on a chill day so I could take my time. Please note though I was still terrible at readings but Sundays were a really good day just to do homework, make notes, or boring readings.  Its been 4 years since I been out of college but I spent 8 years in it getting 2 B.S.s. Mainly cause when I first graduated it was still the recession and I couldn't get a decent job and it took me 3 months to get a minimum wage job so I stayed in school funding my life with financial aid and student loans. And I liked a lot of aspect of being in college. Everything besides lacking money.

I'm no example of being the best student. I started off failing my freshmen year and had a 1.4 GPA at the end of it but worked hard and finished my first degree with a 3.125. 

Let me tell you, its not about inspiration but being motivated by fear and growing older and becoming more disciplined. 

My routine was to minimize going to classes I felt like I didn't necessarily need to attend. Definitely still go if it was quiz, homework turn in, or anything for a grade but if it was just a notes day for a history class, following the syllabus, and I had the book, power points, references, then I wouldn't go. I would still go if it was a subject I would be interested in but it would depend on my energy levels too.

Mainly, my goal was to reduce my stressors which meant prioritizing sleep and studying and doing homework in the evening (I'm an evening person). 

This routine was the best for me because I didn't focus in classes (instructors words would go in one ear and out the other, too many people to look at). And because I would study best at home or in the library.

If I studied at home then usually its like 30mins of reading and/or math then 15 or 30mins of break. Usually that 1:1 or 1:2 ratio. But sitting in the library in the very back helped improve that ratio a bit. I did that if it was calculus 2 work. So, no, I never sat down for 45min at a time readying.

I remember one time I spent 12 hours in the library doing study problems for cal 2.

So yeah, I definitely wasn't the fastest worker in my student group. It took me longer to do my work. I had to reread things because I got bored halfway thru the paragraph. I took a long time to do my homework and projects because I took a lot of breaks doing it. But I was the top student in my Cal 2 class. I start making A's, 3.75 semester GPAs and one 4.0 semester. 

Mainly just finding a routine and priorities that worked for me, finding the spots and time I learned the best, and top it with discipline and fear of failing with a pile of student loans to show for it. 

And all this was before I discovered I had ADD. I thought I was just a lazy student. God, if I had a addy script during college I probably would have had such an easy time. And you could go to the student divisibility or advocate center to get extra test time if you had a ADHD diagnosis. Man I wish I would have known then. 

Also, I burnt out hard at the last year, year and a half, of my 2nd degree so my focus and grades started to tank. I was ready to get out of school at that point. I study in 30 minute intervals, at home ill put the washing on and once its done i have a bit of break hanging it up. It helps me re focus.  I smoked a lot of weed in the increments/doses double finance degree you are speaking real shit man i agree with all of it and honestly this is great general life advice for people with ADHD  Ahhhhhhhhhhh thank you so much!!! It is such a good reminder to remember the achievement for what it is. My friends are constantly reminding me of my achievement right now since I sometimes start to downplay it.

I certainly am savoring it because I am going on holidays for a month during Christmas! As a reward for finishing my degree and a chance to get away before I enter the corporate world **forever** Thank you!!!  Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (Major in Networking and Applications) and a Bachelor of Business (Major in Financial Services). I am going in to the cyber security sector!  Happy cake day!  Thank you!! and as couchpanthers said, Happy Cake Day! >Are you me? This sounds super similar to what i've been doing. Congrats! As a fellow ADHD soon to be double degree graduate i know how tough it is and i'm proud that you're out there showing the rest of us that we can do it.

Thank you so much!! And omg congratulations, super proud of you! Proof that ADHD doesnt mean we cant become in charge of our own fate. YOU CAN DO IT KEEP GOING! SO glad to hear this :)  A potent combination. And congratulations!  PREACHHHHH I would either overthink or over complicate a assignment thus take double the time. However this lead me to get really freaking good marks on assignments. I was a lazy ass so I stuck to one location, moving locations for me was just another excuse to stop what I was doing, and/or I would hyperfocus so I wouldnt even think of doing it at the time.  I speak from personal experience.  After I got accepted to grad school, I immediately went into panic mode asking myself stuff like, "Am I smart enough? Do I belong in grad school?  Am I good enough?"  And instantly, the moment of pride and accomplishment disappeared and fear and self doubt showed up.  When I graduated grad school with a 3.8 GPA, instead of enjoying the moment, and savoring the accomplishment, I instantly went to self-doubt mode again and was like, "what if I'm not good enough for this field?  What if I spent all that money and no one will want to hire me?  Instantly, I started focusing on "what's next," what other boxes in my life I needed to check off to feel successful and accomplished.  A wise friend who is about 10 years older than me gave me the great advice to just. stop.  Stop thinking what's next, trying to do what's next, and just enjoy right now. 

 So, I waited 2 years to start my licensure stuff that goes with my master's degree, and I have to tell you, I am so thankful that I did because I'm going into my "next step" with more knowledge, more life experience, and more self-awareness in addition to more practical experience than I would have if I went straight into it from grad school. Anyways, sorry to ramble, but I feel very strongly about this advice because ADHD or no ADHD, everyone feels the pressure to do what's next.   But if you have ADHD we spend so much time trying to feel worthy and confident, that we end up losing focus on the whole reason we do the things we do: So at some point after all of this hard work, and because of all this hard work, we can enjoy life.   Haha, for sure. Thank you! Huge congrats to you, too!
