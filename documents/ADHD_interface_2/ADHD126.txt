I can't focus reading anymore. I can't.

I really can't.

I just discovered this subreddit earlier on today after realising that my lack of focus is seriously affecting my productivity in doing certain tasks. 

I'll attempt to read a book, and I always have to consciously drown out other thoughts of things that randomly pop into my head at this moment to stimulate a "clear mind" to read. Yet, even doing THAT is distracting. I'm thinking about trying to focus rather than...actually focusing. 

Not to mention I absolutely suck at reading fantasy novels where advanced literature would be used to describe a character's features and/or a scene. 

I've bought around 5 self-help books convincing myself that this'll be the day I turn my life around and not one of them has been touched.

I'm screwed. Why 5? Just one at a time
