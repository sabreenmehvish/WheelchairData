I miss reading books Reading used to be one of my primary hobbies. It made me so happy. I love learning, I love being involved in others' stories, I love learning new words, and I love the way words look. I used to write for fun, too. I have so many good memories tied to books. 

However, somewhere over the years, I stopped being able to concentrate enough to enjoy reading. I'll be reading a sentence and have another thought going in my head simultaneously, and I'll follow that thought. I'll reread the same sentence 10 times, never absorbing it. I'll get distracted halfway through a paragraph, and come back and forget what I was looking at and have to restart it --
 even with things I'm interested in. So I stopped reading. 

I'm in the process of being diagnosed and one of my main hopes is that if I get medication, I'll be able to read again. I miss it so much. I want that part of myself back.  i think the biggest problem is how prevalent computers and smart phones are now. you probably used to read a lot back in the day because you didn't have many other forms of stimulation. have you ever experienced a power outage where you couldn't use your computer or your phone anymore? suddenly you're able to focus on reading --- because there's nothing else to do! 

the internet is seriously the worst thing to have ever happened to an ADHD person. i think i'm going to start seriously considering cutting out computers/phones in a big way. 

maybe then i'll read again :) Audio books have been a savior for me.

I have a very long commute, if I listen to music my brain goes into race car video game music, and then there's the general anxiety of being stuck in stop-and-go traffic.

Having an audiobook let me zone out and has reduced the anxiety of the commute to almost nothing. I live in the desert, so I just drive out a few minutes to somewhere relaxing, leave my phone in the car, grab a latte and a few joints, and perch up for a few hours. 

The best thing to happen to me was moving here. So calming. Lol I feel ya [This article] (https://thebaffler.com/your-sorry-ass/total-attention-deficit-frost) gives some good tips on how to get back into reading again. The author is a socialist but you can ignore the politics in the article.

For me it was really hard to get back into reading. You do have to push through a bit, and be okay with only being able to read for a couple minutes at a time. But if you keep working on it, eventually it gets easier and easier. The tips in the article about reading things on paper and logging off the internet to read helped me the most. I used to be able to concentrate on books. Then I could only concentrate if it's an audiobook. Now it's only podcasts. I read missing books. ;-)
I book reading Misses.
I book missing reads.

Hard to read for me too, more and more. I used to be a library junk. I miss reading for hours, all day, in bed and only getting out for snacks.

Alas! Things change. It's strange. I just lost my kindle and I'm not panicking about it... 
My " tagline" for years has been read your book. I've always been the woman reading a book while the band is playing.

The last time I wasn't actively reading at least 2 hours a day up to 6 was when I had my kids, Irish twins. 
Right now I'm launching a new company, coincidence?

What's going on in your life that's different? 
And did you start reading really early (my mind wants to know)

 I'm exactly the same. It sucks so much, I want to lose myself in a book so badly but I just can't get absorbed the same way I used to. I have to read things over and over again but it feels like they don't quite go into my head. So frustrating! I discovered my passion for reading after being prescribed medication!


I read The Name of the Wind, and I'm currently reading the sequel, The Wise Man's Fear. They're pretty thick fantasy novels, but I've had a blast reading so far. I'll be sure to pick something less daunting for my next book though, haha. I want to apologise in advance for the long comment; I feel like I just have a lot to say about this and I'd really like to share my experience! :)


I didn't read recreationally for about six or seven years until I recently started reading Harry Potter again. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 14 and because of stress, concentration problems and depression I simply couldn't read anymore. I just couldn't focus at all. It was a drag having to read books for school, even though I'd always loved reading. And reading books for pleasure was completely out of the question.
Then, like I said, I started re-reading Harry Potter. It's one of my favourite franchises and I loved the books when I read them as a teen. I decided I wanted to try and read the books again because I'd never read the English versions before, so I got a book box that included all of them and started right away. Surprisingly, I was invested immediately (though not without some necessary hardships, of course). I've been reading the series over the course of three months (maybe even longer) and I'm doing really well. I've had some 'off days' where I couldn't read at all, but generally I've kept at it! I'm guessing because I'm such a big fan of the franchise, it's easier than other books I've tried to read. I'm actually now on book seven! (And kind of dreading the moment it ends... haha)


Anyways, I'm having a ton of fun with it! And I feel like I'm actually doing something productive with my time, rather than just browsing Reddit for the entire day or spending weeks on end on a videogame. I have a few books I'm planning to read after HP, and I'm quite excited about it! Having read this much over the past months has really motivated me to read more: I now realise just how much fun it is to read again. Furthermore, I now *know* that I *can* read, which is probably the biggest motivation for me to continue.


A few things, specifically, have helped/are helping me a lot to get back into reading, so here's some tips from my recent experiences:

Start with something that's easy *for you*. Aka, 

1. Read a book you used to love before or a genre/topic/franchise you're already heavily interested and invested in (HP, in my case). You're less likely to put down a book if the content is about something you love. 

2. Make sure the level of the book (language use, genre, topics) is right for your reading level. Don't overestimate yourself: reading something at a high level can be very interesting (I love reading old and historical books, for example), but it is also very intense and exhausting; you're more likely to put the book down. In the same vein, don't read a book that's too easy for you. I tried reading my favourite series from when I was about 14, but it got boring fast because it wasn't challenging to me at all. A good book to pick up reading again is likely at or just below your reading level.

3. Choose a book that you can read casually. Avoid books with a complex plot and many characters. You'll likely find yourself feeling 'off' about reading through the process of picking it up again, and that's to be expected. I've found myself unable to read for a few days, up to two weeks at a time. If you're reading a complex book with many characters, you're bound to lose track of the story; not only is that very discouraging and unmotivating, you're also very likely to just give up. If the book you're reading has a fairly straightforward plot and few characters it's easy to pick it up where you left off.

4. Don't force yourself to read a lot! Especially in the beginning, don't plan or expect yourself to read for hours on end straight away. Be sure to take regular breaks, and just quit reading if you find it's starting to drag, even if it's only been 15 minutes or so. I tend to read for two hours a day max, three if I'm really into it. On most days it's between 15 minutes and an hour. I mostly read during 'in-between moments' (breaks at work, on the bus, toilet visits), and it helps me, because it requires a lot less effort and investment than actually sitting down to read (I find that incredibly hard). Reading before bed is also really nice.

5. If you do decide to actually sit down to read, be sure you know what conditions you ideally read in. Find out which places you enjoy reading in, whether you prefer music, non-distracting background noise or silence, what kind of light you prefer, etc. (Mine can be very specific!) Try to recreate these conditions when you sit down to read. Of course, sometimes you can feel like a bit of music even though you normally prefer silence, or you wanna go to the library while you normally read in bed. Just follow your gut and do what your feeling at that moment tells you.

6. This one may be personal, but I'm finding having e-versions on my phone of the physical books I'm reading really convenient. Sometimes it's more convenient to read from your phone! I switch a lot between the two. Reading before bed is also really nice from your phone as you can dim the light very low to make you sleepy and you can easily lay down without having to hold a big book with two hands.

7. If you're having a sitdown, be sure to keep something to drink and a light snack near just in case.

8. Try to make an effort to cut down on chat services, social media and other services that may distract you. If you're easily tempted by notifications and finding it hard to ignore text messages from friends, it's better to tell them, 'Hey, I can't talk right now, I'm having some me time. I'll get back to you later!' instead of putting your phone on silent.

9. Try not to invest in too many entertainment media at the same time. It's fine (and natural) to switch between reading your book and a show you like (for example), but avoid getting invested in too many entertainment media at once, especially if the stories are complex. Not only will you find yourself distracted faster, you're also more likely to lose track of the individual stories (especially if they're similar). Try to avoid reading two books at the same time altogether, from my experience, that's a confusing mess with AD(H)D.

10. Last but not least... drag the book you're reading with you everywhere you go. I've been doing this as well and I've noticed the effort I have to make to go back to reading is a lot less than when I 'plan' to read. If you don't feel like reading after all, you can just leave your book in your bag and continue another time.


I hope these help you a bit! :) What I found (and still find) most difficult, is to take the step and make the effort to *continue* reading once I've started on a book. If you work on making this step smaller, you'll find it gradually becomes easier to pick up your book again. And take your time! Don't pressure yourself to do more than you can or want. I'm pretty sure three plus months is a long time to finish the HP series, but my enjoyment is more important than finishing it quickly. :)


(By the way, it took me over two hours to write this... ADD, hurray.)

Edit: Formatting. I almost had to check that I hadn't posted this and forgotten about it. 

I too was one of the promising kids who read years above their grade/age and would read at least a book every two days. 

I have so many books that I've bought because I want to read them...I miss reading 😔

I listen to audiobooks on my way to/from work and, while it's good, I drift in and out and find myself rewinding it frequently. I also have to listen to them at 1.25x or 1.5x to keep my attention?(if it's slower, my mind wanders more).  Try audiobooks! I turned up my nose at them for a long time because I used to be such an avid reader too, and I love paper books, and I felt like I *should* be able to just pick one up and read it. But audiobooks are better than no books! Read while listening to music, that works for me!
 Tell me about it! I was one of those promising kids in elementary school who read a book a week and then when books started getting more complicated and difficult to get through, even while interesting, my reading-habit sunk to maybe 2 books a year, if lucky. Nowadays I read mainly comics, which I'm very pleased with: they're fun, interesting, you get through a number in an hour, which is the absolute most amount of time I can dedicate to just reading. That way I get access to good stories without being in front of a screen or feeling like I want to die. Medication helps so much for reading. I still have a huge problem finishing books and am currently 'reading' like 10 books but it's crazy how much slower I have to read and how much less I absorb while off my meds You never said what genres you enjoyed, but I know that personally, Brandon Sanderson's writing style makes it very easy for me to focus.  He writes a variety of fantasy novels, but he writes with a very clear prose, and with a big focus on action driving the story.  He is renowned for his "Sanderson Avalanche" as well, where the story rises in action to a huge degree at the climax and ends in a very satisfying fashion.  If fantasy is of interest, I would really recommend him as someone to try out.  What's nice too is that he writes everything from novellas, to 1000 page hardcover epics, so you can start light and get heavier if you so choose.  

Regardless, I hope that you find your way back to reading, it sounds like it once meant a lot to you!  Good luck! It used to be one book a day for me, now it's maybe one a year. :( I agree with other comments that computer and smartphones have definitely lowered how much I read by A LOT. I do miss reading, I just have to force myself to do it a lot now and sometimes I just can’t get into it. I have a huge pile of books I hope to get to over winter break during the times I get really bored... but we’ll see if it happens. What sucks is that I WANT to read but I just CAN’T most of the time.  **Audio books**!!! Seriously! I was the same and loved to read, but can't concentrate enough to find it fun. 

Audiobooks you just throw on and you can even do other things at the same time! I love listening to an audio book when doing the dishes or walking to the bus. You can have dozens on your smartphone quite easily.  It's not that I miss reading. I read a lot more now. I don't read physical copies anymore, but I read books. What I miss is loving to read. In elementary school they actually started searching out new books with me in mind because of how voracious my appetites were. And the chase was awesome. Now with everything so freely available, there's no chase and it make getting the thing less fun and this makes me love reading it less. This is going to sound silly but sometimes it's about finding the right book.  Until earlier this year I literally had not read for pleasure since childhood, but around the time the the It movie came out I randomly picked up some Stephen King books and I've read like 2000 pages in the last 3 months.

If that doesn't work, audiobooks are really great (sometimes even better) alternative to books.

But honestly medication (I predict) will basically make this a non-issue.  There are loads of things that I genuinely enjoy hut could never do without my meds. I can definitely relate. I would read and write all the time when I was younger but once I hit university I began to struggle. Not exactly the best time to have trouble absorbing information haha.

Most others have said computers and smartphones have been an issue, and I'm sure it is for many, but that wasn't the case for me. I really don't know what happened, kinda came out of nowhere.

Anyway, I hope you get it figured out so you can enjoy reading again. Hey, I just wanna say that reading this really helped me not feel alone. I used to love reading as a kid and now I find it incredibly difficult to do and it makes me sad. My boyfriend sometimes reads to me which helps but I wish I had the i independent concentration to do it myself. I’m glad I’m not the only one experiencing this. I was just talking about it yesterday.  I'm exactly the same. I've read many novels in the past, then just stopped about ten years ago. I wonder if the internet has something to do with it. Too many short snippets of information have ruined my attention span. I feel ya. I can only really read when I'm medicated. Good luck! It can be frustrating to find the right drug and dosage​ but it's soooo worth it!  Get the right medication, and you will read again.

That is the largest difference I have noticed in myself. I *can* read without medication, but it is *not* enjoyable and it is *not* easy to do. It goes exactly like how you described it.

Right now I'm medicated and had no issue reading your post. I don't have any issue reading anything, actually. Well.. if I encounter a word I don't recognize I tend to chase the meaning of that word.. if that happens too much per reading block, I may end up missing details.

But wow I had no idea how hard reading was for me. I'm exactly the same. I used to love disappearing into a book, now it just doesn't work for me like it used to. I too have switched to audiobooks but I also listen to a lot of podcasts too. I use Audible, but I also use Overdrive and RB Digital to listen to library books for free. Different libraries have deals with different apps to supply e-books and audio books to their card-holders. If you have a library card it's likely that you have the ability to use these services. Some libraries offer membership for out of area users for a small fee too. I feel you. Up to my 19th birthday (roughly) I could read a book a day and I have red thousends of books. Now I average 4-7 a year. I don't even read my studie books :( Maybe get your eyes checked for prism or strabismus, where your eyes get tired because they don’t always work well together?  Anecdotally, it seems there may be a connection between prism and adhd.   My vision is fine but I have glasses that help my eyes focus in the afternoons when I start to get tired. 

Edited to add: It looks like there’s more than just an anecdotal correlation between convergence incongruence (strabismus) and adhd...

 Same boat and I thing it has affectected more than not being able to focus on my classes .Try checking books out of the library , you'll have a deadline so it may push you to read them before returning them . I used to do this back home when I was allowed 4 books a week but now I'm allowed to 20/3months and let me tell you that my card is always maxed out and I read maybe 3 books on  a good month .
Do you remember the quality of your reading back then? Because I feel like even if I was an avid and fast reader I didn't everything ou of the novel , I can get the general plot some random part of the book that caught my attention but I feel like I alterned between states of innattention and hyperfocus but I still could get the general picture at the end .Did anyone experience the same thing? I've noticed that since entering adulthood with so much of my time sucked up by family, work, and other responsibilities, I don't have the mental energy to focus on even things I enjoy :( 

It sucks feeling so drained and like I don't have the energy to invest in things that would inspire me or recharge me. I love playing tabletop RPGs (Pathfinder) but I had to leave my group because the sessions left me so drained and my symptoms were awful during game play. Start playing D&d. It's not reading necessarily but it's still story telling. Best part is that it's collective story telling. You'll get your fix believe me I miss being able to play crpg games but now I just can't really get into them past the first couple of hours. I own POE, arcanum, BG1, fallout 1 and 2, wasteland 2, divinity original sin, tyranny, planescape torment and decadence but only 2 of these games ive ever actually played all the way through. I used to love these types of games but now I get easily bored. I'm on medication and I still don't read well. I find myself actually saying "blah blah" and skipping ahead because I don't have the patience to read everything in an article.

The meds don't fix the bad habits that you picked up due to your attention problems. I'm still struggling with procrastination and task initiation. I have the same problem..
It sucks. Once I find a book that gets and keeps my attention, I tend to repeatedly read them over and over. 
I'm on my 4th or 5th run through of Ready Player One,  and I've probably read the entire Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy trilogy (all five books) 30-40 times.

I try new books all the time.  Sometimes they click and get "added to the rotation" & sometimes they don't. If they don't, I still have my shelf of old standbys to fall back on. exactly how i feel about painting. Everyday i want to do it but lack the ability to focus on it. 
 Getting a public library card and utilizing Overdrive really helped me get back into reading. Overdrive offers both books and audiobooks through your library - it's a game changer. 

My Kindle made a huge difference in reading to me as now when I'm out and about, I can take the time to read with a large variety of reading material at my disposal roughly the size of a skinny book. 

Hopefully you get the help you need and you'll get back into reading! I haven't been able to read a full book outside of a required school book in almost 8 years now. I feel so stupid. Up until the end of high school I read so much, and was almost all I ever did. I get so pumped looking up books to read and when I start something I lose focus in half a page and it makes me feel worse. I thought going back on my medication would help a ton, but I get so preoccupied with other thoughts still. I miss it so much :( Reading is focus, it will sharpen all aspects of your life. If you forget what you just read, read it over and over. Train your brain. Indulge. Read anything, I love reading smut. Islands and queens and total crap fiction but I learn new words and train my brain. Books will always be there for you, if you can read, you must.  I just started using audiobooks and it’s working wonders. I buy the book and read along with audio and it’s great. I can actually understand what’s going on without having to read the same page 4 times.  I really feel the same way you describe.

In 2015 there was a post in r/books: 17 brilliant short novels you can read in a sitting.
I ordered about half of these and really started getting back into reading, but I stick to shorter books.
This week I finished City Of Thieves- David Benioff, which I found easy to stick with to the end.  
I also think in addition to the ADHD, my vision is worse and that makes reading harder.
Good Luck

 I stopped reading once I got to college because I just didn't have the time or the energy after reading for assignments. I did get into comics around this time though. Much easier and faster to read! I do miss books though... [removed] r/nosurf is a really helpful community for cutting back on the internet :) I relate so much to the OP and this comment!!! My phone has destroyed my attention span. I used to read like crazy. Now I read short articles/short stories on my phone instead of actual books. I wish I didn't have a smartphone I hate them tl;dr: had week w/out 'net, was sweet, helped with adhd-pi symptoms and mood, reading is fun, but it's totally a muscle (but that's fun to train!).

I went away for a week with my gf, and we decided to have a zero-internet week. We're both ADHD-PI. It was such a nice experience, in so many small ways, and a big part of that was the solitude proper, away from a smartphone.

Although trying to read my book the first day was difficult, in fact, exactly like OP described, by the morning of the second day I found it much easier to stay focused on the contents of the pages. By the fourth day I was only flying off the page every 15-20, and coming back to earth in much shorter intervals. Still not perfect, but y'know, I quite like daydreaming, so that's ok.

Smartphones are cheeky little bastards that sneak into the corners and stuff up your headroom without you really realising it. First off, they slip into those spaces of time where you'd really benefit from just sticking with the damn book. "Switch to me, plsplspls". Second, we need that working space to move all our tangled, unwieldy thoughts around in, and make some sense of them. Iirc some study showed that simply proximity to smartphones reduces aspects of working memory...

Anyway, YMMV, but I find 'time gawping at internet' is positively correlated with 'feeling like shit' and inversely correlated with 'ability to read books'. They're all interrelated, but making a comfy reading space and seizing every moment where I think 'I'd like to read' has worked well to flip the scales. Good plan. I should try the same.  Mmmmm.  Maybe.   I’ve been unable to read fiction since well before computers.   i got a flip phone... It's the opposite for me: audiobooks are so hard for me to follow because if I lose track it's harder to figure out where I faded out.  It's cool how different people are affected differently! Yes, I don't have access to many audiobooks right now because I can't afford the prices or a subscription, but I spend so much time listening to podcasts while doing other things. It helps me so much, to the point where I'm going to see if the accessibility department at my school can create audio versions of things I have to read for class.  I second the suggestion of audiobooks. If you find yourself struggling to pay attention even to an audiobook, try seeing what Graphic Audio has available. They are audiobooks that get acted out almost like a radio drama, with different actors for every character, sound effects, music, and I personally found that that helps me keep track of everything much much more easily. No more "who was talking?" or anything like that, because you quickly tie each character with their respective voice.

I struggled with regular audiobooks, but after listening to a couple Graphic Audio books, normal audiobooks seem quite a bit easier to focus on now.  I second that, I am an awful reader and have scotopic sensitivity so reading in general sucks, but I love audio books, podcasts, etc. I've discovered that I'm really good at taking long solo road trips, because I can put on an audiobook and just zone out. It's actually the most relaxing part of my trips usually. It's basically meditation.

People keep asking me why I don't just fly to where I want to go, but why would I want to spend several hours shoved in a tiny enclosure full of miserable filthy loud humans? honestly, tv/computers/phones was the worst thing to happen to an ADHD person. of COURSE we're going to choose the most immediate, most colourful, animated, etc stimulant over a book if we have a choice. 

i need to start putting myself in situations where i DON'T have the choice to reach for the tv/computer/phone. after X minutes of discomfort, you start to relax and be able to concentrate .. but having that fucking option of the internet in front of you is too hard. even now i'm on this damn website instead of starting work for the day! Desert life is pretty fantastic.  Are you saying that the move from some other ecosystem (like a temperate forest or something) made a significant difference, or was the move to a desert out of a city? ...you think this author is a socialist? And that there are politics in her advice? 

I must be missing something because everything she says is really basic common sense for handling distractions and for adding discipline to one's life.

Socialist! Good lord.  Thank you for sharing that! I think I started reading a little earlier than average and was always a couple grade levels ahead. I was a voracious reader through elementary school and middle school -- I'd go to the library and pick up 6 books for the week. The book fair was the best haha. I think it slowly started to dwindle away at the beginning of high school. So it's been like this for quite a long time now.  Fucking love those novels. Still waiting for 3 Wow, I don't know what to say. Thank you for writing all of this out. I'll definitely refer back to this. I've actually been really wanting to read Harry Potter again lately!! :)  Haha, I wish I could do this. I have to be in complete silence or all I'm thinking about are the other sounds.  Yeah, same for me. And I've *started* so many different books I really want to read, but none of them are ever, ever finished.  That's funny. I think one of the last books I finished for pleasure was also Stephen King!  I hope you're able to enjoy it again soon also!  I have trouble reading now too. Part of it is also how technology has changed. Part of it is just getting busier as we grow up. I read literally hundreds of books while not paying attention in school growing up. I'm somewhat of a binge reader so it's been hard for me to work into routine adult life.

What I've done is make it something I look forward too. I keep a book in my work bag. I'm able to read by scheduling it and making sure my phone (aka rectangular ADHD exacerbation device) is elsewhere 

Once a week I get breakfast at a cafe and read for 45 minutes. I read at lunch sometimes too. I don't bring my phone or anything else to do when I do it 

 I really, really hope that's true. Yeah, it's not like I *can't* read now. It's just become such a negative experience that I never want to. It's almost painful when I feel myself drifting off again and again. And I know it'll take be 5x longer than someone else to read it. I just want to be able to focus solely on the thing I'm doing. I don't know.  Wow. Okay. I have already been diagnosed by a psychologist. I'm getting a second diagnosis by another team so I can get accommodations by my university, and potentially be medicated. That's what I was referring to. I'm already working with a therapist. I sought out diagnosis because someone *else* mentioned ADHD as a possibility based on massive problems I've had through my whole life that have destroyed me and left me behind my peers. 

This is beyond rude, because you're making a claim I'm a drug seeker AND erasing my experience by looking at a quick, single post I made about *one* symptom when I'm sure you know, people are dynamic and can change over time.

I wasn't able to get a diagnosis when I was in early education because I wasn't hyperactive, and am also a woman -- who, as a whole, are *severely under diagnosed* and also often present symptoms differently. 

Also, and this doesn't even matter, I've never used substances that aren't prescribed to me. I rarely drink. I don't smoke. So why would I want to seek out a stimulant that I know can cause so many issues if I don't truly believe it would help me? Maybe I'll just let myself fail out of college for the third time because of untreated issues again. 

Last, depression is co-morbid with ADHD to an extremely high degree. They feed into one another. So, like?? I don't understand your point. I have multiple mental health issues. Guess what? They're all likely tied to ADHD.  I love how ironic the concept there is. Come to this place on the internet to help you stop ... getting on the internet.

^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/6l7i0m/blacklist/) I completely agree and I think your story explains it perfectly. I didn't get a smart phone until really late in the game (like, my second-ish year of college), and I've totally noticed a difference in myself and my attention since I made the switch. I've gone through periods where I mostly unplugged and always made much better connections with other people. However, when we would get internet access my whole group would crawl off separately from one another to start checking SM. I still don't think I could read then, though lol.  I have a hard time picking a good audio book to hear. The selection is massive. I use OverDrve so it is all library connected & free.  I was the same way until I started listening while walking.  I have a hard time being motivated to work out but if I was listening to a good story it was easier not to get bored and go home. In Missouri, we have a network of libraries who have put their audio and digitized books online for free. You might want to look into that  because other states do to! I'll second what /u/reallyshortone said and go check out your public library. Many of them will have options for audiobooks out will at least be able to tell you the best option.  [Librivox](https://librivox.org) is entirely free audio books. Public domain literature narrated by volunteers. Great for classic works. There are a lot of free podcasts. 

Also, consider loading a **youtube video** on your phone, put on headphones, and then put the phone in your pocket. Kind of an impromptu audiobook if you have videos or channels talking about stuff you love.
 
 Overdrive through the public library system (US) offers rentable audiobooks. Also depending on the books you can find some on YouTube. I did this for one of world lit classes because I have a two year old and it’s hard to read anything with someone going “momma why doing?” Every five seconds. I have found that Audible is well worth the $14.95 a month because I use it every day. It even helps with things like noise distraction because it works like a noise filter. I hope you find what you need.  Hey, I made a tool that you might be interested in, it converts a YouTube URL into an audio-only URL which you can stream or save.

I like to use it on my phone to save data and battery (since YouTube made screenless playback a premium feature (and banned it from other apps) and it's still not available in my country).

Sometimes YouTube detects it and you get "access denied error", but it works most of the time. 

If it bugs out you can always use http://keepvid.com/ which does roughly the same thing as mine, a bit more reliable, at the cost of being slower and having more ads. 

KeepVid also lets you save the video, not just audio, which might be useful to you.

Best wishes. Check out Overdrive. It is an app for your phone, tablet or use the site on a computer. I'm connected to all the audio books for the my County Library & another neighboring state's major city library. I connect to anywhere I have a library card. You can get 10 books at a time for 18 days. If no one is in line you can renew for longer. The app keeps track of where you are. There is a sleep shut off timer, you can slow dooowwwwnnn the words to 1/2 speed or make it faster. Sometimes to get to bed I'll set it at 1/2 speed. I'm currently listening to a nonfiction book that was published in Oct of this year. I was on a waiting list to get it, and it is getting boring. I have trouble finding a good book to hear sometimes. There are actually a lot of "radio dramas" out there. The BBC still does a lot of them, and you can find quite a few on Audible.

And of course, sometimes the books you want to read get made into movies and TV shows. :D Going into winter here, I am so craving nature. Not jungle nature because I've already done that. Cabin nature, hiking nature... I'm over stimulated and id like a break and I'm wishing I didn't hate winter.
 I've been told that I read before I could talk. But I couldn't, still can't spell or really bother about grammar. I do try sometimes but wish that people could just get how I speak or type.

I have a daughter, who I believe has been misdiagnosed with being on the spectrum/slight aspergers who as a kid was always playing with numbers. She didn't come home with good grades in math, but she did once win a math contest. 

It's like I had an uncanny sense that I could extract information from reading at a very young age, but I got what I needed ( the gest of it, enough information) and stoped at sentence structure somewhere.

When I was around 25 I discovered the 8 times table (babies and lack of education). As a young kid I was subjected to flash cards to remember my times tables. That was torture I didn't want to happen. I can't in hindsight complain because my parents were not meth heads. But.. I didn't learn anything and it was torture... take that experience, instead replace it with anything else. 

When I was 25... I just had the thought one night " 10 - 2 that's the 8 times tables. Dammit 10-3  That's the 7 times tables. Why didn't anyone tell me?

The hallmark of an intelligent person is an curious mind that absorbs knowledge. I'm always wondering about the world, I  really like knowing how everything works.

 When I was 5 if someone had told me that, " you got your 10 times tables, and your minus 2's down. Let's combine them and you got this next step

 It never would have been an issue. My 8 times tables would have been something that took a second to learn, instead of like a decade. I'm learning to ask people to explain abstract concepts like I was 5. It's amazing how quickly I can catch on. 











 Np! I'm just hoping it might help anyone who reads it. It's an incredible joy to finally be reading again after all these years, and I can only wish the same for others! :) His books have their flaws but hot damn I've never had such a good time reading as I have since discovering him.

I hope you get your meds and can dive back into the world of books, it really is the best medium for storytelling imo, and even though ADHD can make reading difficult, but definitely not impossible.

All the best [removed] It's more about controlling what content you're looking at and using the internet purposefully instead of mindless scrolling. But yes the irony is real. I use GoodReads to look for books I find interesting, then look for them in Overdrive. I live in Missouri! Tell me more!! And sometimes, as long as you get them back on time, they're FREEEEEEEEE! Oh yeah these days I just download lectures, interviews and podcasts from YouTube to my phone -- there's sites where you can get the audio download link. Hey, I made a tool that you might be interested in, it converts a YouTube URL into an audio-only URL which you can stream or save.

Best wishes. Wow, this is awesome!! Thank you so much for sharing it with me. I'll definitely be using it :) I've read quite a few articles that state people with ADHD naturally seek out the outdoors because those activities allow us to release energy but also are calming. I've always been huge into the outdoors and, little did I know, it's like a natural remedy.  Yes, I believed it was rude you claimed my seeking out help for a diagnosed medical condition was "disgusting and offensive." I was stating how I *felt* about what conclusions you erroneously jumped to, not you as a person. 

Again, you are erasing my experience. Honestly, you're arguing about my symptoms when you will never know how I've experienced them. I am totally aware ADHD isn't an instant thing. I never said I instantly developed a neurological disorder. 

It's the opposite -- I've had these problems my entire life, I just never knew what they were. I attributed it to personality quirks and developed coping mechanisms that failed to a point where the only option was to get help. We are not all so lucky to have others recognize our symptoms in childhood.

*Yes*, I already have a diagnosis -- from a psychologist. I'm not ashamed to say I want to try medication because that is the first line of recommended treatment for adults. My psychologist cannot prescribe medication. She referred me to another group of people who can provide evidence to my university that will help me to get both accommodations and medication. My school requires it. I'll be going through the diagnosis shit three times, with three different medical groups sending their records between them. This isn't something easy, or something I take lightly whatsoever. Also, it's super expensive. I wouldn't be taking action without my doctors urging to do so. I'll still be in two types of therapy, I'll still be seeing a psychiatrist, and I'll be working with the accessibility center at my school as well as learning program specialists. 

I never changed my story, you just filled in blanks I never provided.  Thanks now I have several GoodReads in my queue.  Look for "Missouri Libraries 2Go - Overdrive". I don't know if any other state has a similar system, but it's worth looking for. I usually download one/check one out for long road trips!
 Go to the local library website. In Wisconsin, we have the same thing. I can check it out online and deliver it directly to my Kindle (or the app I think). I've always been afraid of bugs, anything that flies and invades my space really. I've flown over handlebars because a bee was flying and I was riding.

I shocked myself out of it, my inner suck it up buttercup had me sleeping with vermin regularly, and constantly shrieking for the first 6 months.

Result?  I'm desensitized. I'll give a time line if a wasp was invading my space. (Not flying is easier for me)

0-10   my neighbours had flowers that attracted alot of bees. To get into my house you had to walk by them. I cried and couldn't go home unless they weren't there. A couple of times my mom relented and let me come in the front door.  Also few skined knees because of falling down running away

Wasps were in the back lane. We, the kids in our neighbourhood had escape routes between the garage.

10-20 I learned to shriek like a cute girl should.

20-30  shortly after my Irish twins were born I was in a parking lot waiting in a car when a bee flew in. I knew enough to get out of the car so I didn't shriek because that wasn't appropriate enough. 

I also learn the making excuse to walk away when there was a flying thing around. My kids have there own phobias, I'm happy to say that it would take me a minute to describe theirs, they love camping.

30-40  We are mostly towing the line and if bugs bother you your not around them.

Then.. Because you are ADD. 40-50 you push yourself.  I can now sit with a wasp on my arm. Ok.



 So true. That's why I work outside. I have tried working inside, it doesn't work. Yay!
