How I feel like a failure. Hey everyone, longtime watcher first-time sub poster (ish). Anyways, I just got back from Thanksgiving break and, obviously, I procrastinated my homework. Long story short bc I know most of us have short attention spans, I finished all the easy stuff in a long ass time and basically just had a mini emotional breakdown (weekly occurrence) and am now pushing back my most important homework to tomorrow morning, where it's due tomorrow afternoon. I'm going to bed I've been up since 3am and those bad thoughts are coming in so I can't be conscious when the show up otherwise it's just me spiraling further into a distracted depressed state. Idk why I'm posting this, I won't see comments until later tomorrow bc I'm a scrub who only uses mobile Reddit. Annnnyywaaayyyys, remember to brush your teeth bc she let I did that twice today. Good night! I hear you. I have meltdowns regularly, things that aren't a big deal for most people, I struggle with. I can't keep a kitchen clean even for 1 night, I've had outstanding tasks for over a decade and don't even have my license. Feel like life is passing me by. Where is all the time going? 

 But hey. I'm sure when you find something you love, you absolutely Ace it. My husband says to focus on the "despite all this, you were able to do *insert achievement" Thank you so much, reading this definitely helped!
