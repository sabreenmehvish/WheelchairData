Reading for extended periods of time with ADHD is MUCH easier when listening to calm atmospheric music. Seriously, I am amazed at how much a new age atmosphere melody in the background helps me stay engaged in a book. That is until I stop reading to post about it on reddit!  Music grounds me in everything. I've always got something playing, sometimes in the background, sometimes as the main focus. 

It seems to give that wandering part of my brain something to tether to. 

For what you're talking about this album (and artist) is perfect. 

[Benoît Pioulard - Sonnet](https://open.spotify.com/album/7EisbIi4ur2hnhnvZND9pz?si=mr-67wEBSgGino9g50zf3g)

I've got tons of other genres I'm into and have an album or several for just about any mood / activity, lmk if you need a recommendation!

e: here's another ambient artist you can't go wrong with : https://geotic.bandcamp.com

If you listen to any electronic you might know him by his other moniker, Baths. Music is distracting for me.  I don’t know why, even instrumentals.  I think I daydream and focus too much on the emotions it evokes.

Tv, however, is just enough to distract me.  Some mindless show I’ve seen a million times; bob’s burgers, archer, friends. Seinfeld, whatever, helps distract the distractible part of me so I can focus.  I can only work in complete silence :(   If it were only reading I could understand that,  because the music distracts me.   But I can't even draw well with the music on.   I will eventually end up just singing and looking up stuff on Wikipedia.  Oh it's a song about a shipwreck,  let me go see what famous shipwrecks I can find!    Seriously,  ugh.   Instrumental music does it too,  but more in the way that I will fixate more and more on the sounds.
 Atmospheric black metal is my “tune out everything so I can concentrate” soundtrack of choice. More energy works when I’m sewing or drawing, more atmosphere when I’m writing or working.  Aphex Twin's atmospheric music is great for reading.

[4 Red Calx [slo]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QfSEIH2WEk) I love some white noise.
Music actually distracts the cognitive functions of the brain subconsciously, specifically in musicians.
White noise changed my studying/reading life. I usually listen to ambient sounds or latent noise while reading or doing work.  Seems to distract my subconscious enough to let me actually focus on tasks at hand.  Moreover this is to a greater extent how I'd describe the effect of Ritalin.  Although it's an upper, a mere 5mg calms me down enough to really get work done.

 This sounds like something I could get behind, I'm so glad it's working for you. Could you provide some examples of what sort of stuff you're listening to?  I found listening to brown noise was best I like rain tracks. no music just rain falling, extra points if there is a little runoff going. I also sit under the shower with the lights off to meditate. REALLY helps. I think it's to do with denying some senses, or "jamming" them with completely unusable data.  Here is one of my favorite albums to spin while reading. If it wasn't for this album, I would still have a bookmark somewhere in between the first couple chapters of the Dark Tower series.

If you can't read full books because of lack of stimulation, this album will keep you invested. Yeah! It sponges up the static, and/or gives the wandering thoughts a place to chill. Calm music distracts me horribly. I need either zero music, or super high energy music.  When I was struggling to get through grad school, one of the things that made it 100x easier was listening to the [Animal Crossing New Leaf](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoIp-AJdIshrKJ7O7h2DmXCS9POcR8lTZ) extended hourly themes, lol.  Listening to anything repetitive has such a calming effect on me, almost no matter the genre.

I used to listen to music on an earbud to go to sleep freshman year of college and one of the most effective songs for me was actually a somewhat heavy EDM song - [Warp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DO6Y9_5e7A) by Steve Aoki. Trip-hop! The genre station on whatever music service.

Doesn't just curb boredom and distractuon. It puts me in in the zone - relaxed hyperfocus. I like to play [Hatnote \(Listen to Wikipedia\)](http://listen.hatnote.com/#en) and [RainyMood](http://www.rainymood.com/) at the same time, really relaxing. There are several focus channels on Spotify that I like. When I want to dig in on something, I have it on low in the background. Seems to help. I seem to go back and forth with this every day. I feel like I need music and thrive most of the time, but primarily with instrumental metal or something like that. If it's something with vocals it seems less likely to help.

I often struggle with getting the right thing dialed in. I work in theatre and a large part of my day is spent with background dialogue and music while intently listening for verbal instructions over a headset. The background noise distracts my lizard brain while my rational brain picks out the important information and acts on it.

Ask me to listen quietly to a book on tape and I’ll fail miserably. Ask me to calmly move a multimillion dollar piece of life-safety equipment with precision in the middle of a rock show? You got it.

Weird how ADHD compensated for itself, no? blocks out all surrounding external stimuli, I did  to get my math done with 25-50 problems to solve I could do the math but it would take me hours, with headphones it would still take long but I could stay on the problem longer and keep the doing the work, also I read some books for english too while listening to music but sometime the music would interfer with me the reading, I never tried, soft, calm gentle music like classical or something might have been a better option Fun music with words for math, classical or instrumental music for reading for me  Not for me, I can't focus with background music. If I want to read or write something I need silence.  Sup soma.fm groove salad check it out. Most music distracts me, but for some reason the Tron soundtrack works. It might be, because it has become so familiar to me and I've listened to it so much, while studying. So maybe it somehow subconsciously helps me get into the study mood. But I've noticed that some non-talking ASMR and white noise also work! 

Instrumental piano music is a no-no for some reason. Maybe because it's not so smoothly flowing like orchestra music. Has more sharp notes or something hm.  I have a few foreign bands that I like. So when I need to read or write, I'll listen to music in other languages. This stops me tethering off into a daydream but also the enjoyment of the song keeps me 'in' the task I'm doing.   i  can focus best when i listen music i acualy like, metal in particularly, atmospheric music acualy distracts me more then poeple talking all around me. Unless I'm on stimulants... then, I usually want total silence. I find that brown noise in my headphones does this (just an 8 hour brown noise vid on YouTube) for me, but music kinda distracts.

Sometimes I don’t want to figure out what album I want or spend time curating the music/feeling myself - so I just tune into a few of the stations on focus@will.  Amazing at getting me zoned in.  I have this thing with sound. It's the only thing that can truly calm me down. However, it has to be just pads or strings and nothing else, otherwise I start getting into it too much. No rhythm, no catchy melodies, no nothing. Sound is the best thing ever, unless it's a noisy classroom or Nicki Minaj Video game music or soundtrack compilations for me. 👍 Yes! This has worked wonders for me. When I developed tinnitus, the ringing was so irritating that I put on white noise all the time. I used it once when I started working and now I never work without it. Came across it totally accidentally but is of great help to me. I can't do melodies simply because of the constant changing. Listen to the same sound of rain on repeat is just enough to cover up the random stimuli around me while also not differing in ways that distract me. I actually really like to listen to a cat purring instead of music, I find even atmospheric tunes end up distracting me too much. I've been using https://purrli.com lately, it throws in occasional meows instead of just purrs. OP, can you post an example. Thank you 🙂 I can't deal with anything with words unless it's something I've listened to so much that I know them by heart. I just start focusing in on trying to listen to the words and can't get anything done. As a result I have a backlog of TV shows and podcasts to get through because I have to focus on them to get through them, and I'm usually incapable of doing that! I am just the opposite.  I can listen to almost any music and probably listen to 8 hours+ of it a day, but if a TV is on I am sucked in till that show is over.  I can't count the times I've wandered past a TV and just stood in spot and watched it for however long. Oh I could never do this, I would invariably end up focused on the show lol I have been working in silence more and more. If this is what works for you you should consider some noise cancelling headphones. Sony WH-1000XM2 is a pretty incredible set that has really helped me out at work.  Can you suggest some bands in this vein? I'm thinking Agalloch, but not sure if that meets the criteria or not. I fucking love them, though! Woods of Desolation fan? Torn Beyond Reason is one of my fav albums and I'm not even a metalhead.  [deleted] >Lichen 300% and 800% slower together

This kinda reminds me of some experimental stuff that a guy I know did, involving the layering of loops that had been slightly slowed down so they went in and out of sync.  Found it super meditative

https://soundcloud.com/robmanuel/sets/gym-core-weird-loops-to-zone I'm scared to know how many times I've played Lichen by now, the best non-drug related reset button there is Look up "skyrim atmosphere 10 hours". That'll do the trick. Liquid Mind channel on Amazon Music or try this :https://youtu.be/KYsldfmeVZ8

I wouldn't be able to tolerate headphones on for very long unfortunately,  I would get easily distracted by those too.   I obviously have some sensory issues!  > Sony WH-1000XM2 is a pretty incredible set that has really helped me out at work.

OMG I *love* these.  They are pretty much permanently clamped to my head (including as I type this).  Cost a small fortune, but have definitely got my money's worth.

 [There’s a whole Youtube channel.](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCHm_D4kNQaRshalYoB1qtbw) Some of it is kind of hit-or-miss, but I’m sure there’s something there you’ll like!

I recommend Summoning, Wolves in the Throne Room, Mesarthim, Caladan Brood, Wonders of Nature, Vvilderness, and Eldamar to get you started with some stuff that I like to have in the background for different projects.

A lot of stuff from the Drukqs album is particularly interesting slowed down.

Someone also blended Flim and Lichen together which go together pretty well, I think if you search Flichen it'll come up. YouTube's being used pretty creatively nowadays Second this!!! Works like a dream.  Thanks! Next time I can get myself to study I'll check it out! 

Ok, probably before then....   :) Have you heard the jazz cover of Flim by The Bad Plus?  Came on my discover weekly playlist on Spotify a couple of weeks back, and was the first time I'd heard it.  Gotta say I really like it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX_Iij8Eyts
