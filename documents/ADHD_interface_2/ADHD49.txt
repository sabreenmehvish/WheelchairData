Best Jobs for ADD/ADHD adults? Hi! I think this is my first time posting in here but i really enjoy reading what works well for everyone. I was diagnosed with ADD/Anxiety about 5 years ago (when i graduated college) and I have worked in HR since then. I always found the jobs extremely hard to manage because of the long periods of sitting still, the detail oriented nature of HR paperwork, having key follow ups, etc. 

Last year I moved and took a “break” from corporate life and went back into retail at a high end department store. This is the first time I have had ZERO anxiety about a job and actually look forward to going to work everyday. I love not sitting all day, not having my day revolve around tedious paperwork, not having keep track of a million emails. My bosses here love me too. The problem is, the money is obviously not that great as i have not yet taken an assistant manager position ( my boss wants me to move up). 

I understand I might never make as much money as I did previously in a traditional office job, but does anyone have a job where their ADD/ADHD does not hinder them? What are some jobs that are like a high end retail job (Account Manager? Liquor Rep?) that have some growth potential and a decent pay? 

Any advice would be appreciated. I am in a pretty bad relationship and I am planning my exit, but I’d like to have a few life details nailed down before i finally get away.  I personally work in software development.

That said, no two jobs I've ever had were exactly alike, or challenging in the exact same way, even in the same field. Some were devastatingly boring and unchallenging in the sense that it was torture, others were exciting but way, way too stressful and high strung.

I think I would suggest looking for where you have both affinity and opportunity, but also know why you are working. Like, is it because you want to retire someday? Settle down and have a family? etc. etc. It sounds like sales and marketing might be a good fit for you?

I don't mean aluminum siding sales, but any industry that sells things that require "a relationship."  Tech is full of niches like this. Even lawn care for industrial offices need people like this.

You get good variability and yes, there is some pressure to "produce" but, if you are good with people, it won't be pressure.  Concentrate on smaller employers where you have a variety of responsibilities and deal with the customer.

Be aware of an old saying in the work world, "People are promoted to their highest level of incompetence."  You are clearly excelling in your current role.  Also be aware much of brick-and-mortar sales is still steadily going away.  So, it's good and fine to be there now, but figure out how to leverage your current experience into the next job. being unemployed; being employed to mess everything up  There is no "best job" for people with ADHD. We are not all alike. The only way to find a job that is a good fit for *you* is to try different things, just like everybody else. Advertising agencies are made for us. No day is the same and it’s constant stimulation. It is a lot of chaos but our brains tend to rise in the ranks quickly with our ability to speak up quickly, creative problem solving and ability to sprint. 
Not saying it’s always the MOST healthy environment as life balance can be an issue for us but it’s for sure a place we can thrive, or at least that’s my take.  I am an account Manager for a pop company. Gig isn’t bad but I have a hard time rotating and doing the little stuff.

I don’t think a liquor rep job would be bad because there is certainly less of that stuff. I certainly make ok money in my job and I know many reps make near  if not over 70k. Worth a shot Auctioneering. Freelance, at home, away from distractions Currently in school for computer science, how have you found adhd to effect your work? And what are some of the difference between yourself and a coworker who you would confidently say doesn't have adhd? Would appreciate any feedback! This. Been a software dev for over 25 years, and I was only diagnosed a few months ago. Got lucky.  Here's some thoughts... Some of these apply to most any job, though, and maybe some to anxiety or something specifically.

* I have constant anxiety about social interactions. What did he/she think of that e-mail/IM/etc? Do my colleagues like me? Do they hate me?
* I don't work well in an open office environment or need/employ coping strategies.
* I can't deal with micro-management. It pushes my buttons to the point that I can lose my cool and behave uncharacteristically unprofessional. Some bosses aren't like this.
* I hyper-focus on work/related things. This is both good and bad. I perform well, am very productive, knowledgeable ... but have poor life/work balance at times. I often, often know about new technology or other things before colleagues do because my brain is never "off".
* I never fill out expense reports/get reimbursed for things. This is not good and I need to do this, it's just so hard to even start, much less remember where receipts and stuff are.
* I do well in a crisis when the adrenaline is going/etc. In some positions I've been called in a lot to fix the damage and put out the fires. Sometimes I overcommit or get in over my head.
* OMG the imposter syndrome...
* I have to take notes on everything and insist people send me e-mails/etc. for things. Most of the time my notes are so frantic and over-detailed as to be useless. I've had to practice and learn what to write down.
* I zone out when people are talking so I try to catch keywords and am frantically guessing at meaning via context. Sometimes honesty is the best policy and the sooner the better -- "I'm sorry, my brain spaced out just now -- can you please repeat that whole thing?"
* Just to reiterate - I'm forgetful as anything!! So the BEST tools are the ones that help you FIND information fast. Get really good at Google, Stackoverflow searches, etc. Get really good at heuristics in searching the codebase/commit history/etc. Those will save your life.

I don't think we judge our own work very well in general, so I will say I have observed in others...

* With ADHD: very productive! Put out work super fast, but make lots of mistakes and generally sloppier work than other members of the team. Still, people you love to have on the team because omg they are so passionate!
* Without ADHD: So level-headed, so patient on working through the most mundane of all tasks, much slower productivity wise but much fewer bugs / much better organized code.

Everyone is different though. No two ADHD people are the same anymore than any two projects or two coders.

If I wasn't so fascinated by the technology and solving problems, I would absolutely hate it. Unfortunately, I've been promoted, so I have to deal with more and more people problems and meetings and things... and those are the worst. Thank God for medication when it comes to those things. Other devs are better at following procedure to a T. I find it hard because that's boring.

I can think out of the box and hyperfocus up some absolute magic they can't.

So for both reasons, I recommend working for smaller companies where your work has an impact and you can be creative. And start your career with some application support, we're usually awesome troubleshooters. Thanks I really appreciate the response! Completely relate to a lot of your bullet points, and deal with similar issues already (especially the constant social anxiety, super annoying). Seems like I am headed in the right direction as I share your passion for technology and problem solving. Everything you said I feel.
