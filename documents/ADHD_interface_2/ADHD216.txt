Me last night "I'm going to be 100% focused on work for the first 5 hours of work...". Me on google at 09:20 "how efficient is it to microwave water?". FYI

* A microwave is about 50 percent efficient. Most of the energy is lost in the process of converting electricity to microwaves (which are part of the electromagnetic spectrum).
* An electric stovetop is about 70 percent efficient, although that varies widely depending on the type of pot or kettle you use. 
 Most of the energy is lost heating the air around the stove.
* An electric teakettle is about 80 percent efficient, although again this varies from kettle to kettle. Electric kettles are generally very well insulated, and the heating coils sit directly in the water, so less heat is lost to the air.
* An induction stove or hot plate is about 85 percent efficient. It creates an electromagnetic current directly in a pot to generate heat, losing very little to the air. I am so glad I’m not the only one who goes down obviously important rabbit holes.  For hours at a time.  I’ve at least learned to write down what I was working on before I start.   the title of this thread made me laugh, but what really gave me warm feelings was opening it to discover that you had detailed what you learned, even if you didn't reach your goal. 

and then reading comments from other people asking questions about that information just really cinched it for me.

i love the ADHD community. we struggle and we mess up just like everyone else but we are curious and genuine and loving. bless y'all.  For those now wondering what an induction burner is:
>An induction burner consists of a ceramic plate with an electromagnetic coil beneath it. When you turn on the burner, an electric current runs through the coil, generating a fluctuating magnetic field, but no heat on the burner itself.However, once you set an iron or stainless steel pan on the burner, the magnetic field induces many smaller electric currents in the pan’s metal. What about different kinds of pots? What makes them more energy efficient? How big is the heat loss with vs without a lid?  All these questions!  As someone who drinks tea daily, this is actually incredibly useful information I didn't know I need, so thanks for that lol. 

To be fair, here I am browsing reddit instead of figuring out if a truck we have at work can just get plates or if it needs a duplicate title first. 
Update: turns out it needs to apply for a title. Joy.  Literally me in class. I caught myself reading a "How to visualize entropy in an encrypted file" in my cultural diversity class yesterday. Thank god for that recording (and that the professor speaks fairly slowly) Every fucking day. So I assume your work isn't researching efficient ways to heat water. This happends when I put all that pressure on myself.  Saying to myself that for the next 5 hours I must be 100% focused on work is setting myself up for some major failure.  Setting realistic goals like "I want to have this accomplished before I get up to go pee next!" really helps.  Because I KNOW I will have to pee roughly every 45 minutes, so I pick something I think I can get done in those 45 minutes so I do not have to sit suffering trying to finish something whilst having to pee.

If it sounds silly but it works it's not silly! "ok, no Reddit today, we are going to focus on work and finish this fucking project"... About 10 minutes ago.  I drew pictures of stuffed sharks for 2 hours this morning.  Researched shark images, tries different poses.  Have two I like.

note:  I am an admin assistant and my work or life have NOTHING to do with sharks or the ocean.... I feel like this is important information that i was lacking. Also, amazing that you wrote it all down here, as soon as i read your post i wanted to look it up myself out of curiosity ( and i also should be working... ). You saved me some time and therefore increased my (potential) productivity! Thanks! I had a lot to do today, so I was going to be at work by 6. It's 745, and I just sat down at my computer. 

I'm usually here at 8:10, so yay? OP yes you are valid and I empathize with your struggle! Also you get extra extra loves for actually including the answers in your post  awesome info!   


I was like "I'm going to start working on my thesis early tomorrow, set alarm at 6:30!!!"

I woke up at 6:30, my flatmate was in the shower, fell asleep and woke back up at 7. Not bad.   
cup of coffee, meds, walk the dog! HEY LETS MAKE THE DOG HAPPY!! go for a long walk to a spot where she is allowed to be off the leash :)   
Dog jumps in mudpool, have to go buy dogshampoo and wash the little bastard. and after that the whole house and myself because Bibi was the only clean thing left... 

Lets make lunch. What shall I make? something healthy? Lets google stuff about nutrition and "what humans are meant to eat" watch several 20 minute youtubevids.

OK but NOW I'm going to work efficiently!   
I'll post on reddit that I have  deadline today and need a push to take my second dose of meds so I actually go and to the work... 

Got the push, took the meds. started prepping my workspace... OH HEY HOW DO YOU TEACH DOGS TO ROLL OVER???? 

3hours later, my dog can almost roll over... I've made her 3 new toys she's not even moderately interested in because she wants to run around and jump in mud today. 

Now, I said I'd start early, I took my last dose of meds for the day and I'm typing an elaborate response to a reddit post about weird stuff I googled instead of following my plan of working hard...   


I WILL WORK HARD THIS EVENING I REALLY REALLY WILL! (Do need to take the dog out too... hope she doesn't get herself in some situation that I'll have to deal with xD)   


I now have decided I want to read the books on dogtraining that my partner has (who is the dogs owner). I'm just dogsitting a few weeks :p  


OK I'm going to work now. I will I really will...   
 Well, I'll be taking my hot plate out more often. Wait...I have a keurig  Thanks for the break down of what you learned. I would have had to Google it myself otherwise. Lol me every damn day I'm glad the content of this post had the answer bc I was like "well now iiii want to know the answer" and you need me from probably being late to work or something.

I mean I'm still on reddit though.  Lol I’m switching back and forth between like five books right now cause every time there’s a reference to something I don’t know I always look it up and find another more interesting book  Ive seen a video if you microwave water too long it superboils. The issue is, it doesn't form bubbles to release energy. But as soon as you touch it or break the surface it will react violently and spew scalding water everywhere  This is why I have so many tabs open. Thanks for the interesting read! :) If ever I needed further confirmation of my diagnosis, this post was probably it 😂. Well done. That information is genuinely interesting too, I had always assumed a microwave was higher efficiency than a hotplate, but I never knew that induction had both of them beat.

Fascinating. Anyway sod the work, it  never goes away. I woke up at 9 am yesterday. I had no classes and ~70 pages of reading to do. I started reading at 4 pm. how does that compare to gas stove? i imagine gas stoves are very inneficient but could be wrong Ohhhh my god this is so relatable  This is useful, and now I really know I want that uber expensive electric kettle that'll heat my tea water at the perfect temperature for each tea type.

But yeah, all the slightly useful inane stuff we know XD I thought it was just me.. I do this shit ALL THE TIME.  This thread is reminding me that I really need to get a job so I can pay for my psych visit and for my vyvanse. Shit.

And also I need a new car battery, so I can fill my car with gas, so I can go to the oil change place and get my car inspected, so that I can get the registration renewed, so that I can actually drive to said job. FML. How efficient is it when I heat water on the gas stove at home? Thanks, because we drink a lot of tea around here, so it's nice to know using the electronic kettle is pretty efficient. What about a gas stove?                 I love that you shared your research because I was immediately wondering the same thing. ;) What's amazing to me is that the difference in efficiency between using my new induction stove and my old electric stove is close to the difference in using an electric stove vs a microwave, and I literally never considered microwaving water to heat it up. I just googled it and it's apparently a thing.

 \- Good for small amounts of water (a couple of cups)

 \- Takes only a few minutes

 \- and be VERY careful of something called "superheating" where basically the water reaches hotter than boiling temperature, but doesn't have anything rough to form bubbles on, so it'll all happen at once, effectively exploding into steam, possibly all over your face. So put something "rough" and microwave-safe in the water or use an old cup with a chip or some staining.  lol! also I'd like to point out that I sometimes heat water in a big pan on the largest burner, more surface area :B TIL about water efficiency Was this on meds or off? Pretty sure the answer is "very". I used to work in a factory where microwaving water was how they heated the product (sitting in a sealed chamber on a platform above the water) up past 1100 degrees.

OH you already answered it. Oops 

 Dude.... thanks to your efforts I’ll be investing in an electric kettle and working to reduce my microwave use when I could use other methods!   

But what about toaster ovens... I saw this post this morning while I was having trouble getting started at 8am. Kicked my ass into gear. Thank you. Great info, thanks That is way more efficient than I thought it'd be...! What about a gas stove?  Ha! That was me today checking a design file for work. Went down the wrong rabbit hole for 3 hours lol Omg 5 solid hours I could never even dream of this kind of productivity! 😂😂 All I know is that a microwave is more efficient than a stove top due to the loss of heat not being transferred directly into the water.

Read an article once where some guy got the necessary electrical meters and went all scientific on this problem. No idea what I was supposed to be doing when I read that.

Maybe they should put this question on tests for ADHD: "Which is more efficient at heating water: a standard stovetop or a microwave?" You’re the first person ever to think of microwaving water... that’s awesome. If it makes you feel any better, I actually needed to know this 😂 Not to inspire anymore rabbit holes but I wonder if this is why water done in the microwave goes cold faster 🤔 I love microwave. When I moved out, I only bought a Microwave for my cooking needs. I usually eat outside, but whenever I have to prepare food for myself, a microwave is always good. I just eat vegetables, oats, and stuff (at least currently I am motivated for my health; no idea about a month from now). And Microwave is great for all that. But this energy efficiency thing is what bothers me. Me in a nut shell Well at least you learned something. I would google it, click the first link, start reading and realize the article is more than 10 words and click out of it. Reopen Firefox and reload reddit front page, get bored within 10 seconds, pull out phone, open safari, and browse reddit 😩 Cringe  Yeah, me too! I also keep a notepad of rabbit holes to go down later. It sometimes saves me from interrupting my work occasionally. TVtropes is probably the worst thing to ever happen to me. Don't even get me started if I have to make a big purchase like a new refrigerator like I just had to do.  Spent the entire day at work picking one out because I would be mad at myself if I messed it up. Nope, you are not alone.  breadcumbs  This post encapsulates me feelings so succinctly.  Such a wonderful place to go if you are going to be briefly off-task at work anyway. I just discovered this community and wonder where you all have been all my life. I was probably too busy googling the release date of Donkey King or watching a video on how to eat a pomegranate (though I currently do not own a pomegranate nor have plans to obtain one).  Haha, this is why I work in Science. Sometimes it is my job to go down rabbit holes. Though that does not always overlap :/ The first time I saw an induction burner, I thought it was magic. Because it instantly heats the "pot" that you put on the top, but the surface of the burner itself is not. Very fascinating! LOL All of a sudden such pressing issues!  Chemical engineer here. The most important thing for pot selection is that it covers the whole stove top. Keeping the lid on is also crucial, as vapour has enormous amount of enthalpy (essentially energy) in it. The heat loss to the surrounding air is also a factor, but not that bad as liquid to gas heat transfer is not that big. Good questions... *hundreds of ADHDers head to Google to chase down the answers to eventually find out what shape of pot is best and how one makes their own pots...* This is going to be incredibly useful whenever I am arguing with an American about why kettles are better than making tea in a microwave! :)  Did Hilbert curves come up at all? [Here's a good one!](https://corte.si/posts/visualisation/binvis/index.html) Haha, sadly not!  I'd forget about the work until I had to pee, then sit with my legs pretzel twisted until I finish the work lol  The hot plate would still be more efficient if you include the energy and materials required to manufacture the k-cups Gas boilers can get to around 90%efficient. But they are purpose built. I would imagine you're looking at sub 70% for a gas stove.  That’s a fantastic idea.  I usually text myself something.  Then immediately forget.  Eventually delete the message.  Then start the cycle again.  I think I’ll just have a notebook of crazy shit I want to learn about.   the "To-Don't" list! I have one also lol That is an amazing idea... now just need to remember to buy a notepad... 😂 I love this idea. I get distracted at work so easily. Reddit is a big culprit on that but it manifests in so many other ways too. I’m going to try to make a list for later. Thanks so much.  TVTropes should carry a health warning, it somehow manages to tickle my constant stimulation itch as well as my deep dive itch.

Dam site is like a black hole, once your in its orbit you aren't leaving  This I also understand.  My husband and I obsess over decisions like that.  Pros and cons.  Wants and don’t wants.  I’m surprised we’ve been able to pull the trigger as often as we do!  Lol I've never admitted this before: there was about a week one summer when I spent a considerable amount of time watching streams of live animal birth.  

Did you know that hippos are born underwater and have to immediately swim to the surface? 

Did you know that a giraffe falls about six feet, head and hooves first, when it is born?  Yeah! I just realised, from reading a paper on electric kettle use in homes in Britain, instead of working, sigh, that overfilling your electric kettle can potentially drag down the efficiency to the same level as a microwave if you're only interested in making a single cup of tea! Thanks for answering, now I’ll be able to sleep tonight!  I don't think you'd really be able to make your own pots, but I'm sure that pot making is fascinating.

How It's Made is one of my favorite shows ever. That's true, though I don't know many Americans who drink tea. Personally, I think microwaved tea has the worst taste. I've always been partial to the regular kettle or electric kettle lol.  I think that's the exact article I was reading when I caught myself! I took a look at the github for the program in general, but didn't get a chance to try it out yet, but it looks like what I was looking for. I use refillable k cups ! :) Bullet journal: Lists! You don't even wanna look at the memos app on my phone...  I used to think the whole “TV Tropes is a black hole” joke was a total exaggeration until I happened to glance at the clock while browsing once ... I’d been reading articles for *three hours.* Somehow, my mind warped three hours into an illusory 30 min. of browsing. It was like time travel.
TV Tropes is a dangerous place indeed.
 http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife I feel like it would be even less efficient since you're throwing out the work that was put into heating the extra water.

So you heat two cups at 80% efficiency and then toss out half of it (presumably none lost to evaporation cuz I can't math that hard), that would put you at 40%

Higher efficiency the closer you get to only one cup.  Hmmm, you don't think it's possible? I guess you'd need a method to heat the metal.... unless there's another thermostable compound you could use for the purpose...? I mean, how does one cook in the wild with no access to pots?! 

This might need a Google search. [deleted] Hahaha that's amazing! Woah, didn't even know they made those!! I oughta get some for my office Bullet journal...  aka me wanting to restart a page because something doesn’t look right on the page or I don’t like my handwriting or I lost the pen I was using ... and a random light black pen doesn’t compare to a G2. I really want to get into them but I get distracted by the dumbest thing on the page. A drop of coffee fell... can’t ignore the stain or see the beauty in it, just wanna rip 2 pages out because now the G2 bled across the page and the second page is wet and the brown color is kind of ugly etc etc LOL Great idea!  Who doesn’t love lists?   Ha ha ha.  Probably not.  I’ve used the dictation app too.  But I hate listening to it.  I wish it’d would take notes on what I say.   [deleted] >how does one cook in the wild with no access to pots

Broad, flat rocks. Suspension over a fire (example, spit roast). For certain things you can actually cook them directly on the fire. 

You can certainly do metalwork at home, but I'm just skeptical of pots and pans specifically, they seem like they'd be super complicated :o What's worse is trying to reheat your tea in the microwave. There were regrets that day. I have a fountain pen and I use noodler's black in it, no bleeding ink for me! As long as it dries first, anyway, which can take a long time on rhodia paper... [deleted] I thought about warning people, but I mean really everyone here should know the dangers of TVTropes. Especially when in response to "TVTropes should carry a health warning" *and* the url spelling out TVTropes Will Ruin Your Life ;P Hmmm, that's a very good point.... for making stew type things that are very liquid though?

I guess they'd be really rudimentary if they were made at home...! Sums up my life.
