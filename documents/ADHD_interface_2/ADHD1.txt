I find this speed reading technology to be extremely beneficial for my ADHD brain  I'm the exact opposite. The faster it goes, the better the chances I'll get the urge to look away, miss some words, get lost and get frustrated. It just won't work for me the way it does for others.  I do something similar when listening to audio like podcasts. If I play them at normal speed, I get frustrated by how slow everyone talks and space out every few minutes, but if I play them at 1.5x their normal speed I don't get bored. 2x is too much, though, voices sound too weird sped up that much. [deleted] I saw this a few weeks ago, and decided to try it. Why not?  
I read their entire site using their built-in reader and actually retained some info. The best part? I didn't have to read the same paragraph more than once. ONCE! That's a first, and I was SUPER excited! I really hope they implement this more places ASAP, even if just as an option for those who don't enjoy it. http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2622099&d=1394392119 [I posted something similar a few days ago! Check this one out too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/20dwce/this_speedreading_bookmarklet_is_a_godsend_for_me/) Anybody wanna give us the Tl;Dr for those of us that did not take meds today? What the heck does this do? I love the idea and want to do it, but after staring at the screen my eyes started feel weird. =( Freaking amazing. I could really get into reading like this. It grabs you and forces you to read. That kind of external motivation is very good for people with adhd. I was able to read, as if by magic, at 600 WPM. 

The only thing that sucks is that they aren't releasing it yet.  It would stop me from skimming instead of reading articles but I think in the long run I would miss more important things since my eyes would wander and the words would be gone.  At least with traditional reading I can simply look back and it will still be there even if I do get lost in a thought or get distracted.  This would pretty much be the worst way information could be presented to me because its just going too fast for me to really concentrate on it and it seems like a hassle to get back to before I was distracted from it.  [deleted] Nice.  I already kinda speed read but I have a tendency of skipping a little too generously when tired.  For me 600 wpm wasn't even remotely difficult.  That's pretty cool. It's great, but it doesn't help with getting lost in thoughts (spurred by what you're reading) and letting go of focus. I tend to not register what I read when that happens, and that's a problem. I desperately want this software.  It makes it so much easier to concentrate for me.  Won't work on an iPhone. You would need the ability to install 3rd party apps. I have the xperia z1 and it runs great. It can be used to open ePub files and display them in the same format as above.   Interesting. This is why I posted it, to see how other people performed with it.

I've really wrangled my ADHD in the past few years, though, so I might be one of the few who find it to be beneficial. Yeah, interestingly enough, I agree. 

Unlike a lot of my ADHD siblings (that's you people!), I was always a bit of a whiz kid at reading. 

I basically became a party trick: my parents would trot me out and have me read the newspaper aloud for people when I was 4.

Stuff like this fucks my reading up, rather than helping. 

I wish we could put our finger on what the precisely the difference in our ADHDs is there!  I already read at 700 WPM, but this is the reason this barely works for me - with normal text, I can glance away or zone out while thinking about something. This doesn't give you any room to process anything you read. [deleted]

I used to think 2x was weird as well.  It's amazing how quickly you adapt though, give a podcast 5 minutes at 2x and it will sound perfectly normal - and then 1.5x will start to sound slow. I like to go higher than 2x, then slow down a bit, and it suddenly feels relaxing. Awesome! Looks like it uses similar if not the same technology Doesn't seem to work properly on GS4, crashes after you select the epub. Awesome :). I wonder if it's the same technology You have to experience it, really. It flashes words in sequence at you while you stare at one spot. The speeds range from 250 words per minute to 600 wpm It's not that long. I suppose it's not for everyone :c I posted a link to the apk if you want it.  My biggest struggle is losing my place while reading and have to go back and find the place where I last remember absorbing the information, which is absolutely tedious. This will just allow me to click one spot to go back to and speed-read it over again. Much more efficient for me, personally You can save reddit threads and check them out later. They're saved in their own section on your profile and everything I would absolutely lose focus eventually and have to go back, but honestly I would rather attempt to re-engage in the speed reading than have re-engage in an entire paragraph. Large paragraphs intimidate me because I lose my place a lot and don't absorb the information well. This technology keeps me engaged longer than reading normally does. I imagine that their rewinding feature will be similar to that of Youtube's, where there is a timeline and you can just click a spot to go back to. So how do you get it?  And then how do I stuff books into it? Same here, it engages me so much more than reading normally. The fluidity of the transfer of ideas is astounding, really. So is this a thing yet?  How can I get it to process PDFs, eBooks, etc.? Yea same here! It's very interesting. What if some of us don't actually have ADHD and instead we have some other undiscovered mental difference mistaken as ADHD? I really wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. The research behind ADHD still has some very debatable topics. The only time I truly focus is reading something interesting  Personally it engages me enough for the information to be absorbed much better than reading normally, regardless of how often I drift off. I was able to do it easily, and I love the idea. I might give it a shot on another day. What is that though

do you install it on your phone or something. wiki says it`s for android They released the SDK to interested developers yesterday :). We should start seeing web apps utilize this technology very soon
