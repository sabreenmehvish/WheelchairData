Assistive technology Does anyone know if there is any device or app that can caption verbal lectures or conversations, etc, that builds up like a book and doesn't disappear as soon as the next like pops up (like on TV). 
  
Looking for something like that where I can use primarily during class, and can skim to find the part where I need extra clarification or missed.
  
TY!
 First of all, you'll need to record the audio. Afterwards, you'll have to use a program like Dragon Naturally Speaking or even Google's tools for speech recognition software.

In my perfect world, if have my phone set to record at the start and end of each class I have in my calendar, and then name the file based on the class and date. I think Notability for IOS does this.   I have Notability on my ipad but don't really use it! Really hope that this is possible because that would be ideal! TY!
