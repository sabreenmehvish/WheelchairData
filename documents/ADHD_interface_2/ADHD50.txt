Finished reading a list article talking about signs someone doesn't have ADHD All of them were wrong about me (which points to maybe having ADHD) except the last one which stated "you probably don't have ADHD if you finished reading to this point." The only way to know if you have ADHD is to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist and get evaluated. Nah. If you read to that point it has nothing to do with ADHD or not. I'd bet people without ADHD are less likely to get to the end. If I was reading a list that was like 'not me, also not me, still not me' I'd nope out pretty quickly.  I know that article, I also got to the end, and I was diagnosed with ADHD anyway.

I felt that point was kind of silly because the whole thing was written in a pretty ADHD-friendly manner anyway. Yeaaaah like there's internet tests and there's evaluation and they are not the same That's why I said maybe. With the help of my mom I am going to get evaluated by a professional.
