What symptoms do you have that you didn’t realise were because of ADHD? What symptoms do you have that don’t fit the ADHD ‘stereotype’ or you didn’t realise were ADHD related at first?  The ability to shut out the whole world and focus on something for a long time.  omg so many - and they're the reason I ended up here and ultimately got evaluated and started meds. If it were all about distraction and inability to focus I would've kept attributing it to anxiety and poor self-discipline. Some that come to mind, in no particular order:

* **24/7 fidgeting and squirming**: I'm not the type of physically hyperactive that makes me always on the go or needing tons and tons of exercise, so I kind of wrote this off.
* **The internal hyperactivity**: I just thought this was my weird personality, maybe some anxiety. Always 6,000 thoughts and scenarios swirling around my head at a mile a minute, at all times, sometimes with a soundtrack playing in the background. I concluded many years ago that the reason I talk to myself constantly is that it's the only thing (without meds) that forces my brain to slow down and filter what's up there.
* **Never being able to just sit and watch TV**: Even as a kid I had to be doing something else - drawing, doing a puzzle, playing cards, anything.
* **TIME MANAGEMENT**: This was a big one as I had no idea the time blindness was a classic ADHD thing.
* **INTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER**: Stealing Barkley's term. About a year before I found this sub and got evaluated, I was at a low point and recognized about myself, "I know what I need to do. I know every single thing. I could counsel someone else. I just can't seem to do even the most basic life thing." Finding the Barkley videos where he talks about this was the first time I cried after discovering this sub.
* **The way my past depression had manifested**: That is, not bipolar but characterized by incredibly unpredictable and often rapid mood swings, often up and down throughout the day.
* **The RSD**: Always just attributed it to low self-esteem.
* Being very **quick to feel overwhelm and paralysis**
* **Pathological procrastination and avoidance**
* Often **skipping directions** and then having to go back and read them when I fuck something up, but also having a **keen eye for spotting problems** when reviewing things
* **ZERO CAPACITY FOR CREATING STRUCTURE**: I'm working on it with the help of meds but it'll never be a strength. I recognized at a relatively early age that I worked much better if structure was forced on me (even though I may want to resist it).
* **Talking too much**: I once got an award in middle school of "Quietest: But once you get her started you can't seem to shut her up." Also not being able to hold it in once I have a thought or idea I want to express.
* **A parent diagnosed in adulthood**: Would've been helpful to know!
* **Spending my days following one impulsive thought to the next and ultimately getting nothing done**: The infinite loop of going to put a load of laundry in, realizing I forgot to feed the cat so stopping to do that, then remembering I needed to take the recycling out, when seeing the recycling bin outside noticing that my entryway drain is clogged, unclogging that, then suddenly remembering I was doing laundry. Etc.
* **Terrible with verbal instructions**: Especially if there is any kind of sequencing involved. I will forget it immediately.
* **Subpar working memory**: Similar to the verbal instructions. I genuinely do understand while someone is talking. And then I can't hold onto it. In jobs where I've had to close out cash registers, I could reliably count the cash 5 times and get 5 different answers.

EDIT: lol I'm at work and stopped to reply to this and after reading it I was like "man that was long" and looked at the clock and realized it was time for my second dose Anger outbursts; I hadn't known that there was an emotional component to ADHD until well after I was diagnosed and started reading up on it.  I'm jumping on this one.

\-Exacerbation of Mental Illness- I didn't realize this was a thing at first. I was too close to see it, as one tends to be. As it turns out, a lot of the negativity that can develop in folks with unmanaged ADHD can seriously worsen or exacerbate mental illness. I now manage my depression and anxiety more effectively since my eyes were opened to the synergy between not treating my ADD for so many years and the symptoms inherent in the other illnesses.

Try to make sure those with ADHD and mental illness have access to management resources of the former and it may mean a less obstructed path to treatment of the latter. It's made an enormous difference in my life. Emotional intensity

Ability to multitask- I can't focus on just one thing

Racing thoughts- I think MUCH faster than I can talk.

Inability to stick to routine

Rejection sensitive dysphoria- I had no idea that was a thing until I read an article about ADHD and how RSD is a symptom.

The way my depression manifests makes it look like I have bipolar disorder I'm still blown out of this..  


At the psy discussing meds..  


"So, I upgrade your diagnose to severe"  


I kinda tasted it and asked why ?  


She then points at my filled out form towards meds screening...

"Your phonenumber is incorrect"  


"Ahh"  


I could list 99% of my "ways" as 100% coping mechanism towards basically:  


\- Having \_no\_ concept of memory.  
\- Time is now or not now.  
\- 100% pure map mind.  


Sounds extreme right ?  


Pretty funny/crazy "ways" and "routines" I have, and how semi "functional" I was. Problems with socializing. Almost looks like autism from the outside. Are you me????????? Also - thank you for this thoughtful reply! I resonate with so so so much of it  > Time is now or not now.

This really resonates with me. I’m diagnosed with Autism and ADHD :-) but I think a lot of the lines between the two are very very blurred!  YES I AM HELLO Oh ha I hadn't even realized you were the OP! I'm glad you found it helpful! 

One thing that's not on here that I thought about later was getting through high school, college, and all my grad school coursework with zero study skills and pumping out everything at the last minute and producing at least decent but often very good work. My brain doesn't work until then!  I knew it  I finally found a way to travel through the multiverse
