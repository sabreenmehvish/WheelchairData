Know when your med is peaking! Hello!

&#x200B;

I am a Concerta user (36mg) and I realized something that helped me be more productive and content with my day. I know when Concerta has it's peaks and how much of the med that is in my plasma during the day. For this I use some a resource ([THIS](https://adhd-institute.com/disease-management/pharmacological-therapy/pharmacokinetics/)) and it contains visual representations on how every available ADHD med (except Desoxyn) peaks etc. It has been really useful to have highest Concerta blood plasma concentration when I really need it.

&#x200B;

For ease of use for you who uses Concerta I'll summarize the concerta/blood concentration in short.

&#x200B;

After 2hrs it is at 40% effectiveness, now plateauing there for 2hrs, from 4-6hrs it goes up, at 6-8hrs it is at 100% effectiveness, 8-10hrs it goes down, at 8hrs it is almost back at 40% and then declining to 0-10% at 24hrs.

&#x200B;

This information tells me that I should be at 4-8hrs when I want to do heavy mental lifting, which has helped me a fair share  in my day to day life :)

I hope you found my post useful! Neat page, thanks for the link!  Too bad they don't have vyvanse on there... I really, really did. Yesterday I took Concerta much later in the day because I forgot in the morning. Then, when it was time for bed, I was having all of the most productive thoughts... but was too tired/worried about keeping SO up that I did nothing about them. Now! Itâ€™s morning and I wish I had written everything down last night at the very least, and that I had the motivation to do any of them! :P Very interesting! I take two pills of Medikinet (20mg) during work days with a 4-hr interval, so I've sat and tried to figure out how the graph would look for me when the second pill kicks in at the 4 hr mark.  


I wonder if it could be as easy as just adding the values of two ritalin charts together, one with a 4 hr delay. That'd give me 3 "effectiveness spikes" instead of 2.  


Sadly, I'm mediocre at best when it comes to maths and graphs. Same goes for biology, so I have no idea how the med-to-plasma ratio works with an extra pill added. Great link OP tysm. I switched from methylph to adderall like a week or two ago and its so nice to see the change visualized! This was fascinating, thank you! Really? - I am on the same dose- but obviously, if you're in a 9-5 job \[going by your schedule\], then you're going to either have to get up early \[so it kicks in\] or stay late? How do you work around a 'normal' schedule and when is the best time to take Concerta do you think?

&#x200B; Oh! I see now! - I just looked at your comments properly, and now looked at the link! Mine is an extended release \[ a really useful link for the different dosages\]. Thanks.  That is very cool, thank you for posting! Visual learning ftw! This is nerdy as fuck and I love it! Thank you, OP!! I just downloaded my med's graph to my phone to help with timing my booster dose. It is! Elvanse is Vyanse, the name varies between countries but both are lisdexamfetamine with the same mechanisms.  Hey pal, isn't this (http://imgur.com/a/WhpalRd) what you are looking for? If it is the correct med you could just space it out as you'd like. As long as the total area made my the line and x=0 is equal to the area made in the graph and the peaks look the same it should be correct :) I feel the same. A brief explanation from the doctor provides far less understanding of the prescribed med compared to a precise visualization.  I go to school, so it's 08-16 average. I take the Concerta at 07, which makes me pull through fine until the end of the day. So it peaks at around 15 and I get home 16:30 which gives me at least 2 good hours of studying before I start to feel tired. I find that that is optimal for me :). If you want it to peak earlier I like to set a timer about 1hr before waking, take the Concerta and wake up nice and strong. It is a really nice feeling to wake up with Concerta fueled energy haha.

Best of luck pal! Oh, wonderful!  Thank you for the education, I really appreciate it! I'm dumb. That's what I get for not reading thoroughly. Read it a second time and now it makes sense.  
It's the first graph on the page. I'm not taking Medikinet XL, but the standard kind (the immediate release methylphenidate preparation kind, mentioned next to ritalin). That graph is for 2 pills with a 4 hr interval as well.  


Now it all makes sense. I was actually trying to work on a graph using two of the previous one, but I guess I can scrap that now. I learned some new stuff about graphs though, thanks! :) Thanks. I went through school without it, but useful to get your input on peak times, so i can get through the day now!
 Anytime love
