Changing careers and would like to interview the following, please: Programmer, Electrician, Accountant, Pastry Chef, Franchise Owner, Anyone in Human Resources Hello r/ADHD !

I am reading "What Color Is Your Parachute" Career Edition and one of the tasks is to interview people who are already in my chosen careers. I was going to post in the actual subs, but I really want someone with ADD to give their insight.

I'm 34, a mom and have really bad ADHD and a bit of anxiety - I'm really nervous about having responsibility, but if I want to make money to survive. I need a job that pays actual money. Right now I work at home as a social media customer service rep - I'm the cheery voice of a popular retailers facebook page. It just pays minimum wage and has crappy hours.

Basically, I want to ask you questions such as:

* How bad is your ADD?
* What is a typical day like?
* How much responsibility do you really have?
* What type of training/how long?
* How is the work/life ratio?
* Do you think you are compensated well?
* Are you able to take contract work or project based work? My ultimate goal is to be able to take a month off during winter/summer break. Or, at least work 100% remotely during those times.

I'm sure there will be more questions, especially ones tailored for each profession.  I just had to post something because I've been alternating between forgetting and procrastinating and the book is due back to the library soon (on my last renewal!) so I posted this while I was thinking about it.

We can talk right in this thread, so It can be useful to others. Or, take it to PMs, discord, skype or whatever.

Thanks!! I'm in none of those fields, but my husband was an electrical engineer.  He kept saying I was smart enough to do what he did, but I'm sure I'd have screwed up a design twelve times before it would ever work.

Were I an electrician, I'd electrocute myself the first day on the job.

They do let me teach college students.  Nobody dies. Programmer here.

> **How bad is your ADD?**

I'd say moderate. I'm not 100% sure, because I have very little to compare against. Mine definitely causes me problems, but I've known a guy with ADHD much worse than mine, even when he's on meds.

> **What is a typical day like?**

Some days I get nothing or next to nothing done. Other days I forget to eat lunch while working in hyperfocus on a task. I find that short, well-defined tasks are much better for me than large, poorly-defined ones. I also do better when I'm working with someone else, but a lot of places think pair programming is a waste, so I don't get to do that much.

> **How much responsibility do you really have?**

Probably more than I should...

Currently I'm expected to take a project, break it down, get feedback from the people who requested it, and code it all up, with minimal input from my boss.

> **What type of training/how long?**

A 4-year Computer Science degree is needed to get a job at a lot of places. It's possible to get a job without a degree if you have experience and can prove you're capable, but it's much harder than if you have the piece of paper. I got a job as a student halfway through the program, didn't finish college, and had to get about 4 years of experience before anyone else would offer me a job. (This has more to do with the field than with my ADHD, but it's important to know.)

> **How is the work/life ratio?**

For me, it's a normal 40-hour/week job with a $65k salary. I've heard horror stories of places overworking their programmers, but the sorts of places that do that suffer from low productivity and high turnover. I've been fortunate enough not to deal with any of them yet.

> **Do you think you are compensated well?**

For the first four years at my first employer, they paid me like a student, then like a new graduate, but never what I felt I was actually worth. I was paid $52k when I left (for a 25% raise!), and my boss had indicated when I got that raise that it was the last one I could expect for a long time. He never considered me as valuable as the other programmers who got their degrees, even the ones who had less experience than me. (Again, this is more related to the lack of degree than to ADHD.)

> **Are you able to take contract work or project based work?**

I haven't tried, and I doubt I'd be able to manage it myself. The ADHD makes it hard to get started each day, and to keep track of a lot of side stuff. I'm good at programming itself, but if I had to deal with finding work, contract details, payment, and so forth by myself, I'd probably be much worse off than I am now. Once you factor in not getting benefits, paying your own taxes, and so forth, being self-employed as a programming contractor does not appeal to me.

Any other questions? Programmer here. My symptoms are on the more mild side of things, mostly innatention and terrible motivation.

If you do go down the software path, know that it takes a lot of self-discipline to properly prioritize things and know where to apply effort. Deadlines are hugely important and it's easy to get to place where it's been 2 weeks and you've accomplished nothing. In that respect, I think starting in IT support or IT operations is better because your work will be much better defined (usually just work a ticket until it's done and then pull a new onel
) and there is usually more flexibility with hours and stuff. You have to deal with people more work those jobs, but it's not that bad, and it's fun to be the hero  It's always a good day if  nobody dies.

Also, I'm pretty sure I'd electrocute myself too. I almost listed carpenter or welder, but I value my life and limbs. Thanks for the reply. I'm in self paced coder camp. I'm reading and understand the words but nothing is sticking. Funny things I got a few gigs from friends, but they are all over my head and since I'm struggling now, it's making me nervous!

Also, thanks for reminding me about the cons of self-employment!

Lastly, quick question: I understand that technology changes pretty fast.  Realistically, how often do you have to learn a new language or something for your job? Are you penalized for not getting it right away?

Like, I'm learning Angular 1 in codercamp, but my ex keeps pushing me to learn Angular 2 - which, if I understand, is completely different. I would like to add onto the above comment. I'm in the IT support field, have been for 4 years, and, depending on how bad your anxiety is, IT support may not be the best choice. I have severe inattention as well as anxiety, not unlike yourself.  Most people, depending on the company that you work for, aren't exactly the nicest to the support team. In their minds, you are in charge of making sure that their technology runs. If they are calling you, their technology is not currently running, and their patience on the issue tends to be on the short side. However, as long as you have an organizational system (Most likely a ticketing system mentioned above) you should be fine getting everything done in a timely manner. Just take what everyone says with a grain of salt :) > it's been 2 weeks and you've accomplished nothing

Glad I'm not the only one who experiences this... I had to google IT Ops. I've thought about DB administration before. I'd definitely look into that and other careers under the IT Operations umbrella some more.

But, I want to avoid support. I've worked customer service and support desk for years and the people are annoying to no end.  Can't say I'm making (much) money at it, but my hobby-turned-side-job is leatherwork.  About the only thing I have to worry about is getting poked or cut with *really* sharp stuff or hitting myself with a hammer by accident. I'm pretty lucky I haven't gotten any new scars since starting, although I've had a couple nicks and pricks while cutting and stitching. XD As a programmer, I'm constantly learning, and I pick up new languages and frameworks from time to time. If you have a steady job, odds are you'll be sticking with one ecosystem, including a handful of languages, over several years. But if you want to change jobs and not do more of the same, you'll probably need to learn a new set of languages.

As far as classes go, I've found that there's a strong pattern with students taking their first few programming courses: Some will get easy A's, and some will get D's and F's. Very few are in the middle. Some people "get" programming, and some just can't wrap their heads around it. I don't want to be unduly discouraging, but if you're struggling with the early stuff, you might be in the second group. If that's the case, you will probably want to pick a different field, because it'll be a constant uphill battle just to get by. Thanks for the reply. Yes, I would definitely steer clear of IT Support. I don't have the nerve to put up with people day in and out. I worked all types of customer service, mainly in call center and I was completely burnt out after a few months of working them. I'm OK with co-workers, bosses and stuff, though. I would love to be some sort of craftsman  (craftswoman?).   I saw a degree in metal working and I wanted to take it so badly.  I always play crafters in MMO games and would love to do it in RL. Yea, I'm somewhere in the middle.  I'm just not into the material, I guess.  I actually enjoyed the assignment when we had to build a game from scratch. Did the typical hyperfocus thing and busted out a half-decent game.  But, I lost interest once we were back at building websites using factories and services and stuff. Today is my first day back on medication, so I'll have yet to see if I can concentrate long enough to finish this module of course. I'm trying to at least finish.

Again, thanks for the answers. I really appreciate you taking the time to comment. If I have more later, mind if I PM you? Sure, sounds fine. Just remind me of the context (career change + ADHD) so I know what you're talking about.
