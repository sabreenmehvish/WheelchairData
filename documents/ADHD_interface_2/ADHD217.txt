Good New Strategy for Getting Reading Done I alternate chapters between books.  I've been trying to read *Confessions* for ages - and I lost my previous copy that turns out was a better translation - and I tend to get kind of muddled and stuck in it.  So when I finished my last book, I decided that from now on, I'll alternate chapters.  So I read a chapter from *Confessions* and then a chapter from my other book that I'm a bit more excited about right now (*An Exorcist Tells His Story* by Fr Gabriel Amorth) and it is going great so far.  *Confessions* has really short chapters (I had to make a rule that chapters shorter than one page don't count by themselves, lol) so that's helping.

I've really never read much; it's always been frustrating and slow.  Since late July I've read three books.  I don't know what's going on!
