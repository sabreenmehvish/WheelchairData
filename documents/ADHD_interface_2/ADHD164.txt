Tips on reading the book Feeling Good by David Burns? Hello,
I bought the book 2 months ago because well I'm depressed, The thing is that I barely read it because it's quite boring and requires to keep a daily mood log for example (I'm terrible at creating habits and sticking to them, I have just so many things I want to improve on).
With medicine it's a lot easier but I don't want to rely on them due to side effects.

Does anyone has experience reading this book and got tips? Also tips in general for reading? (When I was young I could hyperfocus on books like a champ but now I'm 20 and I can only read really really interesting books)

Thanks :)
