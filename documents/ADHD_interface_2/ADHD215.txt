I'd find lifehacks much more useful if I could even slightly remember them the instant I scroll them out of view  Life hack: Save them all in one place: a list, folder, Pinterest board, etc... Then never remember to look at them ever again. At least, that's my method. *sigh* Make a list on a sheet of paper if ones you find most useful. Put them into a document on your phone and set reminders to refer back to them. [deleted] Getting from short-term memory to long-term memory is the WHOLE art of learning. Its not easy, but you can do it. Some people have suggested notebooks and Evernote. Those are great, but can be overwhelming if you haven't developed the HABIT yet. 

Start simple. Here's a tip to get you started:

Today - write down everything you want to remember on a single piece of paper. 

Tomorrow - start a new piece of paper. FROM MEMORY, write down the most important parts from the previous day (this is RECALL). Then copy over whatever you forgot (and still want to remember) to a new piece of paper. Continue to use this piece of paper to write down the new things through the rest of the day.  

Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. 

Here is the one thing you need to know about the brain - each time a neuron path fires, the resistance of it firing again DECREASES. Just like muscles. Use it and build it up, or don't use it and lose it. 

To build your memory, USE your memory. The act of recalling makes it easier to recall. I have been using evernote.  I have different folders like "now" for quick off the cuff thoughts/kind of a diary...sometimes I take this and put it into my actual journal.  I have recipies and to do lists for my wife and each kid and work and shopping lists, podcast notes, books I've read, wine notes.  Everything.  

I always had (and still do) have a problem with having a work calendar and a handwritten one but now I can even take a picture of my hand written calendar we use for bigger events like trips and have it with me all the time.

Every few weeks I'll forget about it for a few days or I'll let a dozen notes clog up the uncategorized folder but since I leave it as one of my primary apps on my phone (while almost everything else is in a folder) eventually I notice the big ass elephant on the screen and get it organized/review. Take notes! I literally bring a notebook to lunch at work with me to help with this ~ if I bump into someone in the hallway, I can write down what they wanted. Ive also turned Pens and paper into a hobby to make myself feel less bad about ALWAYS having pen and paper on me. 

You can do it! Sometimes I wonder why I even bother reading anything, I forget so quickly. :) /r/adhdshowerthoughts My memory: wack   
My follow-through: wack  
My object permanence: fuckiNG WACK i made piece with not remembering these well. when i need something specific, i look for it and i either find it or... you know, just do it the standard or dummy way. I've just spent half an hour browsing top all time of /r/lifehacks because of this when I'm meant to be going out for dinner üôÑ  The only one I can kind of remember is being mindful of my thoughts as they‚Äôre happening, which carries over from meditating. Like, sometimes I‚Äôll randomly notice that I‚Äôm thinking and briefly be fully present for a moment. This is probably because it follows the same format that is commonly advised for changing behaviors, which is to write down ‚Äúif ____, then ____‚Äù scenarios where you specify a desired behavior in response to specific things that occur. When meditating regularly, it‚Äôs like setting the intention of catching yourself whenever your mind drifts off, and the act of meditation is practicing and reinforcing this. The more I meditate, the more this happens and it‚Äôs helpful because when I catch myself in autopilot, I can step back and try to gather my thoughts and figure out what I have to do in that moment.  I email it to myself and keeping a rolling todo list in my email. If I wanted to remind myself of something I usually start by searching my email anyway. I can't even remember having something if it's not on display... And people wonder why I'm so messy. I think it‚Äôs a good idea of print those types of things out and maybe hang them somewhere in your house, even if you need to make multiple copies, have them there so you won‚Äôt forget and then have them on your phone as well. I have a midori insert for this kind of shit I couldn't live without google calendar and alarms on my cellphone oh and google home. If you can stick to it. https://youtu.be/5hLnY9L1c-M I use trello (a list/project/task tracking website) and just keep it open as a tab all the time Thanks everyone. I now want: 
- a metal cover for my notebook 
- a bookmark i can write on 
- this flat pen with post-its that i want now. Doesn't ship to australia so i will now have to remember to track it down.

Lol sigh lol 

Edit: emailed company to ask them to supply to australia because we make the world a better place for everybody!  Pick a few life hacks at a time and immediately start doing it.

In the past I read many self help books. Since I forget everything moment the book is finished I summarized it in bullet points. Still, I end up not doing most  of that what I learned. You are so inpatient to improve yourself, you learn techniques all the time and you don't have time to implement any of that.

Now, I don't read any of those books. I'm not obsessed with life hacks. I never used 99% of what I learned. But, over the years I have experimented with many habits or techniques. None of them were life changing but some of them helped somewhat in dealing with problems. Those I have retained.

So, my advise is if you are reading an article or book about self improvement, just make notes on the practical stuff it tells you to do. Nothing else. Imagine you are reading a article on time management which is 10 pages long. The conclusion of the chapter (solution) is to plan your day using google calendar and maintain a to do list. Just write those two points down on a piece of paper or type it on your computer. You don't have to remember the extra details like why they work etc.. Then immediately start using google calendar for that.

**For example the only thing you should remember from what I wrote above is**


1) Note down any practical advise from what you read in a piece of paper or computer.

2) Immediately start doing it.



**These are the actual life hacks I do in my life**

Use the app called Todoist to make all To Do lists I need. The list for "Today" is displayed as a widget in my phone home screen. So it's the first thing I see when I unlock the phone. There are two other lists called "shopping" and "future".  "future" list has stuff to do that has not been put to specific due dates yet.

I use the app called Business Calendar to plan the day. It uses google calendar but adds extra functionality like drag and drop appointments and shift multiple appointments forward or backward in time.

I use the app called "Money Lover" to track all my expenses. This helps me budget.

I have a small notebook and a pen in my pocket at all times. I would write anything of importance there. Somehow, I find this faster and easier than typing into my phone.

Do 20 mins of mindfulness meditation after waking up in the morning.

Do 40 mins of cycling in the evening.

Maintain separates notebooks for each field/subject I learn in OneNote. Sync it in all my devices so that I can access notes from laptop, phone or tablet.

This is pretty much everything I do that can be considered life hacks. I‚Äôve recently started bullet journalling, and I have to say, it really helps with not forgetting things. I keep a little notebook on top of my fridge so that I can occasionally search through it and go "God why did I write THAT one down? Why don't I ever write any USEFUL tips down?" The rest of the time it does an excellent job of gathering dust and falling on my head when I open the freezer. Basically that way with FB & Reddit. I‚Äôll just hit save & finish reading this later. (Never look at them again... even with the FB notifications to look at them) I feel this on a deep, personal level. Great idea!

I think I will forget it before finding a place. RemindMe! 1 day I can barely keep track of the notes I keep for important stuff! Same I have hundreds of new notes on my phone with random numbers and shit This is my experience as well, but I have noticed that when I write these notes by hand my memory of them tends to be better.  That being said, I also rarely look at them again if ever... Sorry if I sound ignorant. But what is ADHD-C? I was this AD/HD shirt recently designed after the band AC/DC and it said "Highway to hey look a butterfly" I believed How do you do a to-do in your email? 

Because i need another system like i need another arm (unecessary but may be helpful and fun) That sounds like a medical device that gets implanted...

Gonna have to use the Google,  I guess...

Edit:  Ah...  a paper insert for a notebook thingy.  Hehehhe I physically write things down that I like as good ideas and keep a big 3 subject notebook at all times filled with the things I need to accomplish each day. Like a bullet journal/ day planner. I do the bulk of my personal weekly planning Sunday night and my work weekly planning Monday morning and Friday afternoons. That way I don‚Äôt forget if I needed to do something Monday over the course of the weekend.

But as far as good tips and stuff go.... I tend to write them and highlight them in the margins. 

This is the only thing that works for me. And rigorous outlook reminders. The real LPTs are always in the comments. üòÇ Just like that! Gotta love reddit!

|-|-|-|-|-|-| I have a little metal notepad that I keep in my pocket. It's the only place I keep notes. You have to engineer your environment, make it a personalized ADHD environment that works for you. I need that shirt! I send myself a todo list like this:

"Project" A



* Bullet point 1 ‚úì [6/21/2018]

* Bullet point 2 

* Bullet point 3...


"Project" B


* Bullet point 1

* Bullet point 2

* Bullet point 3...


"Project" C

* Bullet point 1 ‚úì [7/01/2018]

* Bullet point 2  ‚úì [7/05/2018]

* Bullet point 3...

And then anytime i quickly think of something, i can just reply to this email with 1-line, the context of the original email is enough so i don't rebuild the full todo list. At the start of each work day I build a new email/todo-list from all the replies to the list from the previous day, which doesn't take too long, just 1-2 minutes. 

I've only been doing this for 3 weeks and it's already long but that doesn't seem to be a problem I guess. I keep the most pressing stuff at the top, and as i go down the list, the projects and bullet points go from "That would be good to work on right now" to "oh yeah, I kinda forgot about that". I'm thinking eventually I'd like to get rid of some of the completed tasks but they actually seem to both build confidence/momentum in me to keep going as well as provide context to which bullet point in a project you might want to work on next, since most bullet points in most of my projects don't actually always have a clear "order" i should do them in, but are all equally fighting for my attention.

A "Project" could be something like "things to buy" or "Code for $project". Appreciate yr search. Sounded like a new cocktail to me lol Witchcraft!! This seems like a very helpful hack for me- thanks so much for your detailed response. 

I often have home projects i think of at work (while working hard i promise!) and the notebook system isn't working for those because memory/etc.. A rolling list is exactly what i want but most apps dont work for various reasons. 

But i already do email! Genius." Scaffolding" term for executive function hacks springs to mind - thanks for this.  ü§™ > I often have home projects i think of at work (while working hard i promise!) and the notebook system isn't working for those because memory/etc..

PREACH! This is exactly why I'm using this system with email. 

I've tried various apps over the years but there is always a 1. a learning curve that I'm resistant to because it's probably 2. yet another inflexible app that doesn't do everything I want. 

And yet email is always *right there*. With just a little bit of effort it has all the flexibility I need.

The only thing that bothers me about this is mixing my work and home tasks, and keeping so much personal todo items on work email, but all the executive "get stuff done" books I've read/skimmed seem to take that approach so I guess mixing work and home tasks is perhaps not as bad of a thing as I once thought.

 I like how you found that solution. There is something satisfying about adapting something to another use - like  how recycling  makes things personal and just right. Not explaining well but it's elegant.
