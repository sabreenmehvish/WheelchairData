Normal people and visualization (for ADHD-PI) Dont you find funny when some CEO tells people that in order to succeed they have to be able to VISUALIZE success, which is basically just walmart version of our daydreaming. Normal people then go on and use their full brain power and focus to visualize some basic shit like having a house or a nice car for a few minutes.

And then there is me, struggling to turn my daydreams off.

edit: My daydreaming is so visual most of the time so i assumed all ADHD-PI people to have it the same way. I guess not. I visualize things so hard that I go through all the emotions of excitement, then boredom, then I don’t even want the thing I was visualizing anymore.  And ironically that same phenomena leads to a lack of success in ADHD. In middle school we had daily "sustained silent reading" time and a reading comprehension strategy report to fill out DURING the period, one of the strategies we could use was "visualization".

My reading comprehension was proficient (also it seems common for  people with ADHD?) so I never had to use any of the reading strategies, so I always put down visualization because reading a book is literally watching a movie in my head.

Anyway I got in trouble for using the same strategy everyday and not stopping while reading to write about a strategy I just used and the whole experience was extremely frustrating.  Oh, I was curious about this (PI here). I've got aphantasia so I just can't visualize at all. I always just thought those exercises were dumb and super non-literal. Though if I could turn off the constant monologue/whatever song I listened to last though, that'd be great. I visualize success so much I'll actually feel like I've accomplished something, which in turn makes me stop acting to achieve anything. I'll daydream to the point of creating scenarios in my head I think could hinder what I want to achieve, or go through such an emotional roller coaster 'visualizing' something that I become physically exhausted.  


I know my desired outcomes, but can't create a linear path to achieving them. I can visualize things for days, I wish that's all it took to get me motivated. I can visualize for days. The problem is translating the visualization for use in the real world. There's this disconnect. I can't draw what I see or accurately describe what I see, and putting what I see into action is a struggle, and never quite right. Part of me feels like if I could fix that disconnect, I could take on the world. This is why when I find a really good book or series I go into hyper focus reading it. It is so easy to visualize what I am reading I just get lost in the story. For all their bluster for creativity and thinking outside the box, corporates are horrified by creativity because they don't understand it, they can't control it and they are threatened by it.

They are the same people who tell you that of you work hard to can accomplish your dreams. It's great news if your dream is to become a lawyer.
 I think the problem is that with ADHD, the visualization is the end step, not the beginning step. Visualizing your dreams / goals / whatever else should be a first step. but the visualization has to be something that I can put into action. I think that's where the breakdown occurs. You gotta put the image in your binary search engine deep in the back of your brain.

Basically the image only does any good if you manage to convince your unconscious mind to internalize it and then start making decisions that lead you to the image.

You can do it. So this is partly why I am tens of thousands of dollars in debt and have shitty credit. Allow me to explain: I moved to Los Angeles and this way of thinking permeates the culture there. It is the way of The Secret and the “Law of Attraction”. I have other mental issues and this totally fed my delusions. I was investing in nothing but acting classes and not working enough at actual jobs to help pay for my dream but more importantly my life and real, tangible things. Then, when it wasn’t working, you’re taught that you must be having negative thoughts and “efforting” too hard to make the things happen when you’re just supposed to be happy all the time I guess. So not only did I feel depressed, I felt like I was FUCKING UP by having negative thoughts and being depressed. I am now at both the lowest and most important point in my life because I *learned the HARD way* that that method DOES NOT WORK. 

I don’t have all the answers but what I think actually does work is having real goals, backing them up with real, tangible short-term/mini goals and tasks, and NOT feeling bad about having off days or having negative thoughts sometimes so you can focus on getting better or even just to a place where you can function right now. 

It’s so attractive because it’s so easy, but echoing what everyone else has said, real life results take real life work. Visualizing by itself doesn’t hurt, but I found that it created expectations that didn’t happen, and so when they didn’t happen I would be even sadder than if I had just set more realistic goals and celebrated the small wins that I gained along the way. 

TL;DR This is The Secret nonsense. Take it with a grain of salt or don’t listen at all and instead set realistic goals. ❤️ Motivational speakers tell people to visualize things as well.  My life is the Film 'Sidekicks'  but I don't get to enter a martial arts competition with chuck Norris  Once I figure out the perfect path to success I stop caring because the challenge is gone. And then I hate myself later when I get hit with the consequences of not actually getting anything done. Yay  I'm the total opposite of you. I'm aphantasiac (which means I can't visualize anything at all). I daydream constantly, but there is no accompanying visual. All I'll ever see when I close my eyes and try to imagine something is the back of my eyelids.  I’ve always been a big daydreamer, too. 

But I also find that the kind of “visualization” of success and positive outcomes that business self help gurus advise is also a really great tool for procrastination. And I learned it in therapy! 

Its a great way to retrain your brain to associate positive emotions to a task (essentially, “imagine how you will feel when you’re done”) instead of the usual associations to guilt/shame, failure and discomfort.  Yeah when somebody tells me to do that, I usually have a better time visualizing than actually doing the thing lol I cannot "visualize" anything. I can think about it, but not "see" anything. r/aphantasia

here is me, i can't visualize. I visualize things so strongly that I’ll start straight up saying whatever it is I’m saying in my daydreams, just to cut back to reality when someone asks if I’m “ok”

I’m fine bish, I was fighting some giant-ass alien monsters before you came in, get outta here so I can get back to it Google maladaptive daydreaming. It’s not officially recognized yet but I’ve always had a rather extreme ability to daydreaming and when I discovered the term a few weeks ago if matched what I’d been doing/feeling for as long as I can remember. Personally it’s always felt like visualization was the only part of my memory that worked right. To recount something from a book I’d imagine whichever page I was looking at, to find something I would mentally replay my last known interaction with it, to remember what people said I have to be standing in front of them watching them speak again in my mind.

I mentioned to someone once though while trying to remember something  (before I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI) that I had to replay the memory like a video until I found the detail I was looking for and they were just like “oh yeah, I can do that too.” Thinking about it now makes me laugh because it’s not like a neat trick, it’s just how memory has always been for me. I totally agree.  Especially when driving.  I have extremely vivid daydreams.  It's really weird.  I know it's daydreaming it's not like hallucinations or anything I just get way into it.  Almost like how when you get really into a movie or book and you are totally absorbed by it. Vivid daydreaming may be linked to lack of REM sleep. I’ve read that having ADHD can make your nights restless so it may be worth looking into. 

On another note, what is the PI for? You make too many assumptions.

Also there is no *normal* brain. It is a figure of speech. Enticing as it is thinking about purchasing a house or what not, the leader is trying to get you to goal set.

Everyone day dreams, it just so happens that us, diagnosed with ADHD are more susceptible to becoming entrenched in our fantasy world than others. I also have Aphantasia, cannot visualize anything in my mind. However, what I can do is "sound/music  visualization" so to speak... but damn I'd like to visualize graphic stuff. I guess we want things we don't have.   So I spent my 30 minute walk to classes this morning playing out a scenario in my head where I'm spearheading a national committee on consolidating and coordinating public transit options across Canada. Glad to know that I'm not the only person whose imagination goes completely haywire sometimes. Wait that takes full brainpower? I don't get visuals but the amount of imaginary conversations or events is countless. I'd say average one per hour at the very minimum. The worst is when it's the same imaginary conversation repeating over and over again. Lol I'm the KING at visualizing.

Plus, lots of CEOs who give advice/talks on success likely subscribe to books like The Secret, which in my opinion, is a bunch of baloney. But ADHD is a "gift"! Right?.... [deleted] I am exactly the same. I don't really have an internal voice either. I can call one up it I want to or try to, but 99% of the day it isn't there.

Strangely my strongest sense in memory is touch. /r/adhd is prolly chock full of maladaptive daydreamers. I am not one of those. But I know the condition well. Well I guess they mean more concerted, deliberate and focysed visulisation, whereas ADHD visualisation just is about whatever.  Dontcha kno it I’m actually convinced this is our super power only we don’t know it bc we couple it with the anxiety of people yelling at us to be different. I have been really shocked at experimenting with allowing myself to live in the daydream for hours at a time (rare!) Careful, brother, you are treading close to 
r/iamverysmart territory... 

 This is the biggest reason why I got depressed and always felt empty. I was tired and bored of most things even before I tried them, just because I spend way too much time daydreaming about them.

Nothing seemed worth doing anymore. This only changed after I started using my medication. I still feel like life is boring, but it's a lot easier to find something that keeps me interested/ focused, which makes sense. This is such a big problem. Sometimes I have to explicitly stop visualizing things so I won't get bored from them prematurely. I met a girl the other day.   


I've already gone through our wedding. It was nice  I can extract excitement and other emotions from my visualizations too, its like taking drugs man. stahp. too real. Didn't occur to me to put it this way but it's so accurate it's not fun. Maybe now I know how to better describe my motivational problems to others, at least. Same I do this in the amount of like one day, and then visualize a new career path/dream/life the next day, and so on.... shit, this is so me lmao that is definitely relatable Holy shit me too. I have lived whole luves in my daydreams... I do this all the time thinking about apple watches.  Yeah... :( SAME Me before making every meal. it’s actually mad how much i relate to this Yea, if more visualization equals more success, i would be king of the world by now lmao. I wouldn't quite say it's the same phenomenon.

Us ADHD brains tend to fantasize a lot - but this is different from visualization.

Visualization is an intentional thing. We fantasize and daydream but rarely intentionally. how do you read a book if not by watching it as a movie in your head?  I have zero reading comprehension.  I can't focus on what I am reading.  It pisses me off.

I waltz around like some sort of math genius but can't retain anything in simple literature.

Albeit, it's way better now on meds. I had a similar experience, except I don't recall us having a visualization option. Super frustrating.  I could read perfectly out loud but my comprehension was rubbish due to my STM I only managed to have reading feel like a movie once when I was in 4th grade reading *The Deathly Hollows.* I absolutely despised being taught how to read over and over and over. What I worry about most is that now that I will be starting a career as a teacher next year, how do I cater to the portion of my class that actually needs these prompts?  jesus, as a dude with aphantasia that sounds like an absurd way to read a book Man I feel that!  I remember as a kid my mother was telling me people draw by “seeing the thing they want in their mind’s eye.”  I swear I though that was a super power!  Apparently, ADHD brains are underdeveloped in spots where people visualize, which sucks because being able to draw or paint worlds out of nothing looks like the coolest thing I’ll never be able to do! I find that not listening to music for about 6 months started to vastly reduce the music in my head. I think im the same. Its like im blind in my mind.  A recent study showed that the more people visualize their success, the less likely they are to actually attain it. And for the exact reason you just mentioned.

The trick here is to spend an equal amount of time visualizing the barriers to achieving that success. That way, your brain isn't telling itself that it's already succeeded, but instead, starts figuring out how to get around those barriers. I find a slightly disjoint version of that: I don't think my brain distinguishes between 'planning something' and 'having made the plan happen'.

So I'll come up with a plan, and my brain marks the whole thing "Done!", and never thinks about it again.

Bloody annoying, as anytime I try to do something about it, I first consciously think up a plan...  I can visualize for days as well...but it takes me 6 months to get around to doing the thing I visualized.  I think having a problem with executive function forced our brain to evolve a certain way to compensate, so we are more creative and analytical. Its like having a special eyes that see the world from a unique perspective. I too feel that if we could somehow fix our executive problems now, we would retain these evolved minds and be actually able to translate them in real world. Lets figure this out and create a post-ADHD master race!

Maybe i am visualizing too much again lmao. If we see that a bit more optimistically, if we simply learn how to translate that visualization, we could basically open a portal to a other world. Same here. Putting down a book is the equivalent of pausing a movie to watch it in pieces over the course of days. And, really, who does that?? There is such great joy to be found completely immersed in a book. Do you ever have the trance broken while reading and realize just how magic the experience was? For me that happened recently reading gone with the wind- I was (mentally) literally in civil war era Atlanta moving among the war filthy hospital with Scarlett and then something broke my attention and I was just looking at words on a page again.  You have no idea what the corporates want or think.  Creativity is prized at anything except the timeserver layer where risk is terrifying.  The issue most people who say that corporates hate creativity have is that they expect to be able to just walk up to the CEO with no appointment, no plan, no research, just some "idea" that will "change everything".  The people who make an appointment, have a plan and documentation get somewhere (often, to a no, but we'll keep it in mind--and the CEO's notice the next time an interesting project comes up).  Creativity only threatens timeservers and seat warmers--but at least from where I sit, most people who claim to be creatives held back are just loud assholes who want other people to do the work.

&#x200B;

Hard work is important, but honestly, what really matters is boring work (which I am avoiding by writing this post).  That, and single minded goals--I launched spacecraft and bought a house before I was 25 because I wanted to; then I floundered around for the better part of two decades.  Most people, I think, are similar--they have their goals, they meet them, and then they have to figure out what next. They may handle the figuring out stages better than I do, though. This is untrue Creativity is vital for a company to stay competitive in a capitalist market. Yeah, it's really about making the idea your single driving goal.  The hard part for most of us is replacing the goal with a new one.

&#x200B;

And there's a secert to this too: don't worry about how hard your goal is.  I wanted to work on a space mission since as long as I can remember.  I couldn't be an astronaut, I wasn't able to get into a good school, but I was good enough at my job that when they needed someone to run reports during launch I was able to volunteer.  I've always gotten what I've worked for, but I don't get anything if I don't have anything to work for.  Right now, I've made my last goal and have to come up with something new. Excellent explanation, but please, how is this done? That movie legit gave me a complex. I had never before considered that I might possibly be saying anything out loud. Since 1992, I reflexively die of embarrassment every time I come out of being deep in my own head and realize there are people around. 

PS thanks for giving me the most accurate and concise possible description of my life; I can quit now Too real >I daydream constantly, but there is no accompanying visual

Please tell me more!  How does your daydreaming work without visuals?  I've never heard of  aphantasia! people with aphantasia: have you ever read a book then watched the movie, and been disappointed that the scenery/characters in the film weren't at all how you imagined them?! Check out r/aphantasia if you haven't ever. Join us! > giant ass-alien monsters

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37) I meant more like non-ADHD than normal.

Its just funny thought that maybe for non-ADHD people to imagine situations in their heads might be as hard as for us to focus.

Also i meant this kind of visual daydreaming. I assumed its hard for them, because there are actually guided tutorials on how to do it and its always like "visualize your dream house, take it slow, now visualize your dream car". Also people that learned to do it regularly act like they mastered some shit and are preaching about it, while these pictures of success are naturally flowing in my head. Of course i was exaggerating when saying that it takes full brain power.

Visualization of success is claimed to be more benefitial than simply setting goals. Something about positive emotions while working to achieve these goals.

It seems to me like focus and creativity/imagination are opossite forces and these kind of visual meditations are a balancing act for overly focused, un-imaginative people. We seems to be unbalanced the other way around. We should restrict our visualization as much as possible, use tools such as minfulness meditation and train our brain to bring our focus back to reality. Its all about balance boys. If you look at it really optimistically. Our brain evolved to compensate for lack of executive functions so we have our own special abilities. We live in a world where prescription stimmulants are thing, so you can take drugs and have abilities from both worlds. Highly functioning people with zero creativity cant take prescription creativity pill so jokes on them haha (they can smoke weed though).

But i know. It sounds fun hypothetically, but world is more complex than that. All those Ls i was taking through my life from having untreated ADHD which resulted in depression fucked me up far more than any potential advantages. Confusion with reality is next level man. You can daydream of hot girl sucking you off and then easily lose no nut november without even touching yourself. >maladaptive daydreamer

I need this on a bumper sticker LOL How come? Because my retarded brain cant stop daydreaming? I think that people who can visualize healthily, that means to a certain extend, find a lot more benefits from it than people who fantasize uncontrolably. I am not implying that the easier you can visualize, the smarter you are.

If you refer to the post-ADHD master race comment, it wasnt being serious. Idk why can’t it be both shambolic and a major benefit  I found that I have better success when I just try to improvise a project rather than following all the steps properly that I get a real satisfaction kick.

Cooking is a great example of this. Get the crock pot ready and look up 900 chili recipes. Figure out what you want to take from all of that and give it a try. You fail, but you learn a bit and try it again. 7 or 8 tries later and you have a chili recipe that makes grown men weep for joy... and satisfaction of a job well done. 

Food works well because I cannot imagine the depth of flavors, the full spectrum of textures and all of the visceral stimuli that the finished product will give me. It is objectively good or bad so you can judge it fairly well. Also I just have to not eat till it is cooked and my hunger keeps me on task and motivated. Yeah it's crazy the sense of ennui ADHD brings Shit, I identify with this so hard - I didn’t even know it was an ADHD thing to get bored of something before you even do it.  Thank you so much for bringing this up. I've been really really depressed lately for no reason, and you just helped me figure it out. I've become depressed from boredom before, I just didn't put two and two together this time. It's terrible trying to explain it, because other people don't understand how it's possible to feel so bored that you feel nothing will ever be interesting again and you'd rather die.  You mean like completely replicating the situation or the topic before you mentally so you already know what it would be like or could be like?  What medication are you on? I’m trying to figure out what medications might work for me (newly diagnosed) I can't visualize anything. Trust me, it doesn't stop the boredom. Ooh, did you do the unity candle thing?

/s I've always been so disappointed when trying drugs, I can get a way better high using my imagination..  It can almost become maladaptive daydreaming, sucks I alternate between over thinking like this and just acting on impulse. It’s hard to find an in between Right?!? I've lived several thousand different success stories in my mind. Haha. Many people can't visualize, r/aphantasia I always took visualisation to be what it sounds like - visual which says to me that it is different from daydreaming and fantasising. To me I think about shit I shouldn't waste time thinking about, like future stuff and fantasising but it is not very visual at all. I struggle to make clear mental images and also to hold them in my head and if I start picturing a new thing the older ones get fuzzy. 

I write fiction and I know my characters very well emotionally and I can create and understand a scene and how it would look, but it isn't a whole visual image in my head of it all and even with my characters I can know them very well internally, but often have no idea what they look like. I struggle with giving directions for this reason too as I can't visualise the whole route in my head. I also do visual art and I can logically think how things will look if I put one element of the design on top of another etc but I can't see my art clearly before creating it and I have to use pictures of things as guides to draw them by noticing the individual smaller lines that make kp that thing (draw what you see not what you think you see) as I can't visualise it well enough to do it otherwise. I'm always surprised by how my final art turns out when done as it is similar to how I logically expected it to be but I had no clear image in my head of how it looks. 

I had suspected this was possibly an adhd thing but people seem to be saying the opposite so I guess probably not. 

So possibly for different reasons but I do agree that visualisation is different to daydreaming or fantasising too  Yeah books get super vivid for me. I miss details like what hairstyle characters have but the story comes alive. Apparently some people it is like they are reading out loud to themselves. yeah I thought that was the whole point, to immerse yourself... is it different for other people? if so, how do they read? You can get caught up in the words that seem funny or they can be talking about abstract concepts.  I've never been able to visualize, but I've read more books than most people. It's never bothered me? Also I think this is one of the reasons I can read more quickly than other people. I can easily read multiple pages a minute when I'm enjoying a book. Godddd yesss. I can remember formulas that I haven’t used in years, and I still have a blast solving any type of math equations...but put a book in front of, it will take me 4x as long to read it as someone else just based on the fact that I’ll have to reread so many of the same pages when I catch myself daydreaming while still actively reading words on the page, but couldn’t tell ya what I just read.  I have issues with comprehension too. The actual words are easy but most of the time I have to reread paragraphs in order to actually get what it was saying into my head. 

Eager kid me still read actually quite a bit anyway because when it finally did go into my head I enjoyed what was written but I don't have that same level of enthusiasm I had as a kid now (plus other forms of fiction like TV have improved) and novels etc are too much effort.  I also tend to start a novel and never pick it up again. 

I'd recommend comics though. Lot easier to comprehend and I've enjoyed reading again in the form of comics. Recently finished a deadpool comic series after not finishing a novel in years  That has always made me crazy. I can visualize the hell out of anything in great detail, but translating what I see in my mind on paper or in speech is nearly impossible. There's this weird disconnect. It sucks, because I love to draw and paint, but I have to have a picture to work from. I have actually gone through the effort to set up scenes I see in my head so I can take a picture to work from, but that's usually too much effort.

I would love to figure out how to develop that skill.  Wow I can visualize fictional worlds in my mind but ask to see me in five years...good luck. It’s like I have constant story running beside my life all the time and I can describe feelings and places but draw it? No. That is a super power.  Haha so aphantasia for the win? Is there a reference or keyword for this (because I can't be bothered to Google it)

Thanks HB I do. If not that, I find myself playing the same movies or shows over and over until I feel like I’ve gotten every detail and gone inside the head of every character.  This happened when I finished the ocean at the end of the lane, by Gaiman. It was so jarring to suddenly not be in the world he had created and it ended beautifully, so much so that I ached to be back in it, that the story wasn't over, or that I could immediately reread it and though it were my first time again. Well said. Corporates are formed by very successful people that understand that too much creativity starts to add too much risk to their success, and so creative moves are calculated using many man hours and the combined knowledge gained by humanity throughout history, not impulsively acted upon. They aren't scared of creativity, more so they understand that being too creative means less time spent calculating the risk of each creative act or decision, thus increasing the risk of error. 
 Agreed, this sounds about right. That and make sure you are in a company where you can drive and implement your good ideas. I spent too long putting pearls before swine.

Curious about your spacecraft before age 25?? > You have no idea what the corporates want or think.

There's the warning bell. You used your personal experience to wallpaper over everything else. Exactly. Often life has something else in store, and I've been lucky recently and had life give me a reality beyond my own goals. It was really during the times of my life that I struggled to have a vision that didn't go well.  

Another thing is that I've found that there really are people that want to control your dreams in ways that sell you far short of your true potential. They suck. And I hate that I sound like a disney princess or something, but only you get to decide what to put there or even know what you put there. You can have any goal you want, and not let anyone know. It's great, and I wish someone told me this as a kid/teenager. Thanks for your perspective. I really like finding adhd role models. Currently working on developing work ethic in the face of discouragement so it’s nice reading what you have to say.  I'd say not to assume the unconscious you will do whatever you say, or that he's even "on your side" at least by default. Treat him well, be honest with him and develop a relationship with him. Give him real stuff to play with. Let him have fun too, don't just use him for work. Once you have a strong bond with your unconscious self, he will be easier to talk to.  That movie was so cringy, but so relatable lol I never realized actual visualizing was a thing until relatively recently. I thought people were being figurative. I'm trying to think of a good way to explain.

I can not, and have not ever been able to form even the barest mental image. I know what things look like, but I cannot call any sort of image up in my head. For example I am wearing red pajamas. If I look at them, and then close my eyes and try to call up what they look like, there is nothing. I could tell you what they look like, but I can't imagine it. Ican't even visualize the color red even though I'd be able to pick out the color of my pajamas perfectly from a selection if asked.

As far as it relates to my daydreaming, for me it seems perfectly normal. My daydreams feel like a memory when I'm in them so it's not so strange. But for me, memory isn't visual either, so it might still seem odd for you. 

If you ask me more specific questions I'd be happy to explain more. It's just as interesting to me to talk to people who can visualize. Given the opportunity to be able to visualize, I think there is a very solid chance I would turn it down. What the scenery and characters look like doesn't bother me at all. But if they mess with the personality of characters or the plot I'll get annoyed. Good bot Sorry that was sarcasm, doesn't come across well on the internet. I'm fully in the camp that ADHD is not a gift and I get annoyed with people pointing at successful people and saying they were successful because of ADHD. No they were successful despite ADHD.

The whole hyper focus this is a great example, it not that we can focus well it mean we literally can't switch tasks at the correct time and manage our time correctly. Your cooking example is so spot on. I did almost the exact same thing for Texas chili and for black bean soup in the Instant Pot a few months ago. Looking back, I realize I do this for any recipe that can be flexible. The only time I don’t is when I’m baking cookies or cakes where it is imperative that the ingredients be as exact as possible.  I do this too! Like I can’t decide on one so I mash them together instead of being indecisive. I seem to cycle between vivid and nothing.. ugh.. I'd like to think I don't act on impulse, but I'm starting to see that I do, just not in the spending-all-my-money-at-once sort of ways. Think more stupidly messing up my sleep cycle every now and then, and planning elaborate outings with people that I later realize I don't really want to hang out with all that much, just because in the moment it seemed like a why-not kind of thing and they seemed enthusiastic too.

But yeah, whenever I get something done that isn't absolutely necessary for my continued survival, it more than likely was done on impulse and a whim. YES. This is me. I can suffer endlessly over what meal to select on a wedding RSVP but then I had not problem getting a random tattoo on a whim at midnight while on vacation.  It’s like I either care too much or not enough. My therapist has actually mentioned to me that it’s important to focus on finding the middle ground with other things but I never applied it to this until now!  Sometimes all of them in parallel made me giggle. thanks. i m in the same boat  Me! It definitely does not stop the daydreaming or boredom ADHD brings on though. Definitely different. I have zero capability to visualize. I can't even imagine simple visuals like colors. It doesn't stop me from daydreaming or fantasising. I used to write a lot and I constantly thought about my story worlds. Same for me! It's so vivid that usually once I pick up a book I can't put it down til it's done. It's addicting! How do you focus on it? I tend to day dream about stuff that’s going on in my life. I’m really interpersonal & I just so happen to relay every social situation I have over and over in my head like a football player reviewing their game footage. It has lead to me being really good at picking up subtle cues & I usually can tell someone’s mood better then they can.

Still can’t for the life of me focus on words unless I need to for school (5 hrs before the reading is due though.) so what do they see? I can't visualize at all so no movies for me. I definitely don't do the mental voice thing either. I just read. I really don't know how to explain what goes on in my mind. 

Maybe like when you look at a speed limit sign? You don't have to think about it. Your brain automatically reads it and makes use of the information. You don't have to think: 'I'm supposed to go 40'. You just know. I just look at a sentence in a book and process it. No image, no words, it's just there. 

I didn't realize people even could visualize until like a few months ago. I just thought a lot of things were figurative . For me visualization (like a movie) is the default, and when I'm reading that way I don't notice actual words or letters or anything, the info just shows up in the brain-movie. I read very very quickly with high comprehension in this mode. BUT if I get distracted by something or start thinking of something else it switches in my brain to the "reading out loud to yourself" mode, and then I notice I am reading actual words, and it's very difficult to switch back to "movie" mode unless I can subconsciously let go of focus and re-immerse myself in the story.

I've never had much success explaining this to anyone; maybe this will be a first.  wut? I want to know too!!!
I’m really good at drawing from a photo reference but from memory? NOPE
I have a lot of difficulty with my job.  I’m a mechanical engineer and have to design mechanisms and make 3D models all the time.  I never realized this was an ADHD thing! I can draw pretty well like copying, like show me a picture and keep it there and I can produce a decent look alike! But ask me to draw a dog or a dolphin or anything really and its gonna look like a 1st grader did it, hell I know some 1st graders who can draw better than me when it comes to that! Lol Yep, this is me. I've got several different fantasy stories running around in my head that I can retreat to (and use as a way to fall asleep at night). I've tried writing them down but the written version is never quite as good Look up Gabriele Oettingen. She’s done a lot of stuff on this subject. I was a programmer in the military.  It really was working nights, running reports on what was even then an ancient system; but they still needed to be run, and it was still being on the launch team.  One of the things about space that's really hard to explain to people who haven't dealt with it, is exactly how many people have to do their jobs perfectly for anything to actually work.

One of the cooler things, though it doesn't sound that cool, was the fix I had to make to load a file to the satellite.  It was just getting rid of a shell script equivalent that was a patch that got shoe horned in ten years before I got there, and was no longer useful because the latest update was made by someone who read the spec.  It took longer to figure out why the script existed than it did to get the file loaded, but it was weird to realize that the launch date of the program hung on me figuring this out in less than a week, even though the launch date was months out at that point.

Ooh I just did the outing thing today, then cancelled 60 seconds later! > Think more stupidly messing up my sleep cycle every now and then, and planning elaborate outings with people that I later realize I don't really want to hang out with all that much, just because in the moment it seemed like a why-not kind of thing and they seemed enthusiastic too.

Story of my life in college What're your daydreams like then? Are they focused on other senses or are they more like, narrative in nature? Yeah I have spent years actively avoiding reading because it is too addictive. I hated living my life resentful of the fact that my book had ended. And when I was reading 600+ page fantasy novels in one day my book had ALWAYS ended.

On medication now trying to get back into reading by reading poetry and other stuff that doesn’t suck me in so fast.  But then find the next good book that sucks you in... That is hard sometimes.... :-/ I really enjoy reading. I am super introverted too. If I can find the right topic or book series I can get into it. If I had a stressful day I have more trouble focusing. I also start replaying thoughts over in my head when I’m reading a lot. In some books it happens constantly, but others can suck me in and keep my attention. Sometimes I just need to pause, and let myself either think something through or just enjoy the daydream. 

If I want to keep reading but I keep getting lost in thought, I do a few little tricks. I use the bookmark tool an insane amount in audiobooks to mark each time I “get” something- like I was paying enough attention. Then if I go autopilot, I go to my last mark. I do something similar with physical books too with a little pencil mark or post-it flag. If it’s a tough read I make notes to myself summarizing passages or chapters. Usually I start doing it when my mind keeps wandering, and can stop once I get into the flow of the book. 

Also audiobooks are huge for me. I listen to them while I walk to work and while I do chores. I focus better when I’m doing something mindless and physical. Nothing. I think. Just words on a page and the comprehension of what they mean when strung together?

ETA: Apparently here are other [strategies, though.](https://www.readnaturally.com/research/5-components-of-reading/comprehension) exactly the same for me. I read very quickly, there's no movie or voice going on in my head. I don't get drawn in by any sense of visualization, rather it's the connections that click that make it entertaining. NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT. Weirdly written sentences /poor grammar will distract me right away and bring me back to the words... then back to processing? Flow? Imagining? Visualizing, if that's what it is?   
The idea that people read differently is mind blowing. I do notice some people mouth the words silently while reading.. but not me, I read way too fast for that. Yes me too but I don’t find it that hard to switch back onto reading-flow.  The best sleep I ever got was when I played Magic: The Gathering heavily for about 3 years. Wonderful, deep gameplay and once I knew the cards really well I'd fall asleep every night brewing new decks in my mind. The visual nature of the cards made it perfect for visualizing in your mind's eye as I would drift off, counting nerd sheep. It’s almost like if I could show what I see in my mind it would blow you away but if I talk about it I sound like a crazy person.  Well this is as effective as lettuce pants, what a shit study

Personally, my thing is to do stuff that works great for a month then it falls by the wayside. Same for all the "brains" I know

 Neither.

I'm great at math though. I can do most mental math without thinking, and my career is a lot of math. What do you even visualize when you do math? Is that a thing?

Directions like a car? I am horrible at directions. I can always follow a path back once I've done it once, but I am the worst at following directions when people give them.  True. In that case, is making bread pudding cooking or baking? Neither. To me they are like reliving memories. But to me, memory isn't visual either. I don't think I daydream much in other senses either, more in concepts and feelings. Does that make sense? My daydreams are simply exploring concepts or thinking about my life. I like thinking about everything I would do to ensure that i would help the earth as much as possible with superpower X, which is usually just being able to stop time or teleportation, but I think about all the repercussions and consequences (for example, if one had the power to stop all crime on earth, but while being mortal themselves, then that could cause a massive underdevelopment and under funding of everything related to fighting and reducing crime, and also poverty since that's a large factor for criminal rates, and when that person dies the criminals would be free to commit crimes again, but since no crime has happened in 100 years there are no systems in place to stop them. But then maybe something else would happen or there was some other way to do it, which could make things turn out differently. It may seem childish but that's because it's a daydream I've been doing since my childhood.). I enjoy exploring consequences and how i could react to situation X in the best way possible


That was a massive tangent but oh well


Mostly i just think about my life though, problems, other people, how i can do things, things i should do. Wait. Really? I thought everyone saw it this way.  That's especially true for people with Autism. My son reads books, but only comprehends its pages in a literal fashion. He doesn't see a movie in his head.  Really? Im pretty sure everyone stills see something on in their head, even if it isn't cohesive or super vivid. Unless they have [aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) Wow. 

So that's normal? That sucks. I'd rather be "no eye function at all" blind than that.

And I doubt I'd be literate if I didn't visualize. Maybe literate in the "I can decipher a text if I really have to" sense, but not in the "books are life" sense.

I did learn to visualize intentionally for advanced math, and it was quite helpful. A bit cartoonish sometimes. For example, I  kept getting domain and range mixed up, until I visualized a king with a cute little catapult. He can throw any rock in his domain, and it lands somewhere in his range. But most of the images are things like lines and fuzziness. I especially love elaborate characterization. I'm jealous of that! It's like once I start seeing words instead of pictures my brain can't stop and go back.  Yeah, minesweeper, the old school game, not the new version, did similar things. >Neither.

If you'll excuse me, I need to go re-evaluate my entire life :(  Holy crap... >What do you even visualize when you do math? Is that a thing?

OK so, in thinking about it, I see an initial picture, like those photo cards in Harry Potter where you see the picture of the person for a minute, then they walk out of the card's frame.  So I see an initial flash of the image, but if I try to focus on it, POOF, it disappears like fog.

When I try to visualize numbers, especially an equation, or when I did those math problems where you have to show your work, by like the third line, the rest of the numbers have evaporated in my head.  I can't do math, even basic division, if I don't write it out on paper.

>I can not, and have not ever been able to form even the barest mental image. I know what things look like, but I cannot call any sort of image up in my head. For example I am wearing red pajamas. If I look at them, and then close my eyes and try to call up what they look like, there is nothing. I could tell you what they look like, but I can't imagine it. Ican't even visualize the color red even though I'd be able to pick out the color of my pajamas perfectly from a selection if asked. 

Like, I have on a patterned shirt right now.  If I close my eyes, I can see a color picture of it (for a moment).  If I try to imagine it doing something, like spinning around, I can kind of see the idea of it, but if I try to think about it, it literally just dissipates.  Like, I can see it in the back of my mind, as kind of a combination of the picture of it AND the idea of it, it's hard to explain.  It's a lot like a dream...you can have the dream, and be in that reality, and then you wake up, and you know it was there and can kind of see/remember it, but when you focus on it, it vanishes.

I don't know if that's full-blown aphantasia, or a version of it, or something different.  I just asked a co-worker to close his eyes & imagine a white polar bear.  Then I said spin it around like a 3D model.  I was explaining aphantasia to him and then he was like "the polar bear is doing jumping jacks now, can I stop thinking about this now? LOL.  I mean, I can visualize a white polar bear standing up & doing jumping jacks, but not like a 3D model in my brain like that, but more like a memory.  It's hard to explain.

My brain hurts now. 🤔🤔 looking at a recipe really quick I would say baking. I was worried I would have to introduce a zebroid into my analogy. It’s breading. Oh, that does make sense. That's kind of how I daydream when I still need paying some attention, like when I'm walking at night in the city. Shit yeah, I hadn't considered that other people don't read books this way. I'm an English teacher. I might need to reconsider my approach to storytelling... Nope.  My wife regularly tells me how much she envies me the movies in my head.  It's only been in the last 10-12 years that I've been able to really get into the beauty of the language as well as the movie, which corrosponds to when I started medication.   Interesting. I recently got evaluated for ASD, partly because of how I visualize/simulate things in my head. I hadn't considered that reading might be different for people with ASD. A video with Temple Grandin talking about how she thinks is what initially made me wonder. It turns out I'm likely not ASD, though I still wonder sometimes. But it's probably just my ADHD, especially now that I'm reading that I'm not the only one who visualizes so much. Does everyone else automatically visualize when someone uses descriptive language as simple as "blue sky"? **Aphantasia**

Aphantasia is the suggested name for a condition where one does not possess a functioning mind's eye and cannot voluntarily visualize imagery. The phenomenon was first described by Francis Galton in 1880 but has since remained largely unstudied. Interest in the phenomenon renewed after the publication of a study in 2015 conducted by a team led by Professor Adam Zeman of the University of Exeter, which also coined the term aphantasia. Research is scarce.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 Just want to say that I have aphantasia (the inability to visualize as described above) and I study literature -- definitely my primary interest in life. There's a lot of wonderful stuff to be found in literature even when you can't visualize things, but I probably dislike/don't get at the same level the books a visualizer would like.  I'm reading about visualizing math and lost of it seems really convoluted.

I could see how directions could help though. Definitely not aphantasia. I know I've read visualizing is a scale. You'd probably be on the low end. Your coworker is probably high on it. Aphantasia is you aren't even on the scale.

If I close my eyes and try to imagine a polar bear I see the back of my eyelids, nothing more. Not even the barest flash of an image or even shape or color. Just blackness. Mmmm bread Some people (like me!) don't have any ability to visualize. Go to r/aphantasia the video at the top explains. Depends on if the person is visual auditory tactile, ect. One of the 5 senses will always be the primary way a person processes information as those are the only 5 paths from the outside world into our conscious minds. If you get visual information and it does not go through the visual processing center of the brain it will not make sense (generally called sensory overload).  I have only seen a movie from a book a single time nearly ten years ago and it was fantastic. Currently I read slowly and get caught up when I don't understand a sentence or word.  I can't visualize. It might explain why, while I like fantasy, I dove into the classics at about eleven. I love books that are written artfully. I read as much or more for the language as I do for plot.  How do you do math in your head?  I'm really curious to know what your internal process is, in more detail...like, I work on computers all day long.  Based on years of study & practice & tinkering around, I know what goes where & know all of the workflows for how things work & where to find the kink in the system when it's not working right.  

Math is more difficult because whereas all of the computer parts are right in front of me, and I know all of the pieces & understand how they go together, math is like driving through the mist...I can see like a hundred feet in front of me, but then it all slowly fades away after that.  Like when you're in really dense fog & you're just surrounded by white, outside of your little bubble.  Except opposite of that, in black. So interesting...I had no idea there was a scale, or that "zero visualization" even exists! >I've read visualizing is a scale. You'd probably be on the low end.

Yup, I think that's it right there.  I do just fine if I'm sketching something out on paper or spinning a CAD model around!

Wow.  It's really interesting that not only are there people, like you, with zero visualization abilities, but also that there's a scale.  My whole life, I've been into art and I've been "creative" and I can work through flowcharts like nobody's business, but stepping back & really examining the underlying infrastructure here, I am *definitely* on the low-end of the visualization scale!  Dang!

Thinking about how you *think* feels like watching the first Matrix movie all over again lol. I'm thinking that maybe for me the way I think contributes a lot to math ability. I don't have mental images or really anything much of a mental voice. As best as I can describe it I think in concepts. 

To me, numbers are like words. You know how your brain just puts words together when you are reading and makes them something meaningful? Basic math is like this for me. Pretty much anything three digits or less just clicks for addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and I can give you an accurate estimation for division too without even thinking about it. I can't really explain that. It would be like asking you how words make a sentence. They just do.

More complex problems aren't too bad either. I just automatically break them down. Like 1264+472 is super simple if you break it down. I just automatically make it 1000+200+400+60+70+4+2 which is simple and I don't have to think about to give an answer to. Other basic maths are the same. All of that takes me about two seconds.

For things like geometry, the shape isn't something I find important visually. Lengths and angles are easy for me to grasp, and that's where the real math in geometry is anyway. Like if someone tells me I have a parallelogram and one of the angles I don't have to think about what the other angles are. I already know. 

In brief, math for me is stored in concepts and definitions. I don't even understand how visualizing math could possibly help. To me it would be like replacing all the words in a sentence with a picture and then trying to read it. It would just make it confusing and slow it down. 

Haha that ended up being really long, but I'm finally satisfied with my explanation. Btw I've never really thought much about it in detail before so that was interesting.

 > How do you do math in your head

for me at least, it's about chaining numbers together with little mathematical tricks. For instance, multiplication.let's say something like 48 * 5.3. That's just a fancy way of saying 480/2 + (5\*3)-(0.2\*3),  which instantly goes to 240 + 14.4, and boom it's 254.4... I don't seem to need a way to visualize, i can hold the concept of numbers and the rules of mathematics in there and pull out the relevant rules to change the numbers around. My mind is very good at finding these patterns and rules, so the more i dived into mathematics the easier it became to just *know* what rules and relationships apply to particular problems. And at this point i've ended up doing data science, because with all these little tricks mathematics just makes sense intuitively to me. Go to r/aphantasia and watch the video pinned to the top. >Thinking about how you *think* feels like watching the first Matrix movie all over again lol.

How do you think I felt realizing people can visualize?

As far as I can tell it hasn't made much of a difference to me. I'm a mechanical engineer and have never had a problem conceptualizing parts. I'm actually better at drawing out my ideas than most engineers I work with. When I design in my head it's all concepts and characteristics. I have no problem knowing the exact dimensions I want, how it relates to the adjoining parts, etc.

I love talking about it with people though because it's such a weird thing to discuss how you think. No, that's a great explanation!

>Like 1264+472 is super simple if you break it down. I just automatically make it 1000+200+400+60+70+4+2 which is simple and I don't have to think about to give an answer to. Other basic maths are the same. All of that takes me about two seconds.

Yup, I absolutely cannot do that in my head.  Even the 1264+472 part...I'd have to write that down.  Just slides right out of my brain lol.

>It would be like asking you how words make a sentence. They just do.  
>  
>...  
>  
>To me it would be like replacing all the words in a sentence with a picture and then trying to read it. It would just make it confusing and slow it down.

That's an excellent analogy!  Boy, you wouldn't have liked living in ancient Egypt with all of those hieroglyphics lol.  Or being a modern teenager with emoji texting ;) >For instance, multiplication.let's say something like 48 \* 5.3. That's just a fancy way of saying 480/2 + (5\*3)-(0.2\*3),  which instantly goes to 240 + 14.4, and boom it's 254.4.

I absolutely do NOT have the ability to hold that in my head.  Just vaporizes.

The only way I got through math was by using my TI-83 calculator to program the math homework & then writing programs that spit out the step-by-step information that I could copy down lol.  I understood the problems well enough to program them, but not enough to hold the width & depth of the formula & numbers in my head.  I am able to commit things to memory, but working through the sequence mentally just makes the numbers evaporate.  Poof, they're gone!

I wonder if that has a name.  I wouldn't say it's like full-on dyscalculia (i.e. math dyslexia), especially because it applies to other visualization concepts, but hmm, this is interesting...I've never really thought this deeply about this topic before! Seriously, I've spent the last hour watching videos & reading about it.  I'm definitely not zero-visualization, but I am on the low scale, and I always considered myself a person with high visualization skills!  Dang.  That's a mind-bender!

I do like stuff like this, like self-help & personal data, because it helps you know how you personally operate & find the best strategies for living your life.  Simply learning that I had ADHD (a good decade ago, at this point) was a major turning point for me...it explained why everything was so difficult all the time, and helped me find new ways to approach things (like GTD), which have in turn helped me be super-productive & learn how to do things like "aim" my hyperfocus where I want it! To me the weird thing is knowing that other people can visualize. It's never been something I experienced so it's odd to think about. Since I discovered it was a thing I always wonder how other people think. Before I just assumed most people thought in relatively the same way. It's supposedly like 1/50 of people who can't visualize, but it's hard to estimate because most people don't realize it's not normal.

I literally bring this up all the time because it fascinates me. I have yet to meet another in person though.
