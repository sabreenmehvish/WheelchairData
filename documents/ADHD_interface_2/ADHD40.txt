What irks me when reading back my diagnosis I just need to rant a little TLDR is at the bottom.  
  
I had to look into my diagnosis papers today.  
I was diagnosed at 29 years old, 5 years ago now. And re-reading it, it struck me that it said (among many other things) that the issues I expierience in adult life could be because I put a lot of effort and energy into doing everything just right, and trying to do everything perfect.  
  
The thing is. It is the other way around.  
  
I had to become a control freak because that was the way I coped with the feeling that my life was constantly crumbling. That was the only way I knew how to (sort of) function in life. By being extremely hard on myself.   
  
The report also said I had enough ADHD issues as a child to be diagnosed. So that is a confirmation that I do have it.  
  
But it makes me feel frustrated. I feel misunderstood and not valued. It felt like a slap in the face to say: well of course you have trouble finishing things when you are such a contol freak!  
  
The thing is. The diagnosis has helped me a lot because it was a confirmation that I was not lazy and there was a reason it was so hard for me to do things others seemed to do without even thinking.  
And thanks to therapy and meds and thanks to knowing that I'm different, I am no longer a perfectionist and a controlfreak. So what my house is messy. I'm rather happy than obsessing over doing the dishes and still not even doing them.  
  
So I guess I just needed to rant a little.  
  
Tldr: My diagnosis report said the ADHD issues I expierence in adult life might be because of my perfectionism amd controling issues. But in fact those were just coping mechanism from living with undiagnosed ADD for 29 years.
