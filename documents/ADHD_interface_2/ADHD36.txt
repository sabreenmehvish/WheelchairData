Any tips for how to not miss important details when reading something? I just noticed that when reviewing details on a job application I completely missed the start date ><. I was thinking I could either read out loud, try to highlight important details in a Word doc, or possibly print out the document and mark it up if it's something I'll be holding onto. 

Can you think of anything that works for you when there's a situation when you can't do any of the above?

I'm applying for a legal assistant position at a law firm so there will probably be situations when none of the above are feasible so I'm seeing if anyone has any other suggestions that I wouldn't have thought of.

Thank you! :) Ah yes, lawyering. My mom has (undiagnosed) ADHD. She usually keeps a journal to jot down important notes and separates that by a single horizontal like. Good luck at the new job! Ah, great idea!

Should hear by next week if I've made it to the interview round! Thank you!
