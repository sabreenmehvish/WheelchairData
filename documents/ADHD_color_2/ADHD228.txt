About to start college I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was maybe 5. I was a demon-child who ran everywhere, wasn’t aware of anything, and didn’t care. I had a 504 plan for a few years but they wouldn’t put me back on one. I had calmed down and seemed to manage it on my own.

Fast forward a decade, I somehow made it through high school. I only failed one class (AP stats) which was during senior year. I had somehow disposed of my coping mechanisms and became so spacey. I didn’t ask for help because I felt like it was my own fault for being lazy and believed my ADHD had “gone away”. I somehow passed my other classes with flying colors and got into 4 of my 6 colleges (wrote my essay on my ADHD!) and am planning on starting in the fall.

My issue atm is that Student Accessibility Services at my college contacted me because I had said I had a disability in my application (I don’t remember doing that. Maybe it was my essay). Should I get help? I talked to them and they said I could even though I didn’t have any documentation from my high school. I’ve never been medicated and I’m scared of it (nothing against those who do take meds, it’s just a whole new world to me). Im not sure if my situation is bad enough where I need extra assistance (drugs, extra time on exams, someone to take notes, etc.) Any perspective please! Go to a doctor who specializes in ADHD and get a thorough evaluation before you do anything else. Obviously you’ll be diagnosed again, but do whatever they tell you to treat it.  Definitely work with the RDS. Also, find a doctor. The RDS should be able to help you with that. Here's a list of things that I found worked for me :
- Sit in the front row in all your classes
- Establish a relationship with your prof early on
- Introduce yourself to your classmates. Try to put together a study group
- Find out if your university has private study rooms. These really help eliminate distractions. 
- Utilize the white boards! It really helps to organize your thoughts and helps you visualize the whole picture
- Find a way to back up the lectures and notes. Either record lectures or take a picture of the notes your prof gives.
- Always read lecture material BEFORE you go to class.
- If you start to fall behind don't hesitate to talk to your prof or TA's
 So I went through uni undiagnosed but pretty serious ADHD. 

IF you can get assistance and/or medication do it. I managed through uni, I came out with two degrees, depression and a genearalised anxiety disorder. Im proud of what I achieved, but if I had even a slight chance to make it easier I would have jumped.  First of all, congratulations on making it to college, and I want to offer you encouragement.  

Get to your physician and ask if you need additional testing to see if medication is appropriate or, if you still have documentation from your original diagnosis, take it along.  Otherwise you can see your university's health service and see about medication.  They are accustomed to this; many students go this route.

Your university has been extremely accommodating in allowing the previous diagnosis, and you are very fortunate.  The ADA covers your rights for special accommodations, and your teachers will provide them. (I teach college, and these accommodations are just a routine part of my job.) You aren't asking for anything special, because we see them on a routine basis, and not just for ADHD. You name it, we see it.) Examples: longer time for testing, quiet room, extended due date, tutoring, etc., depending on the course.  And you can accept it or reject it, but you should consider it for some required general ed courses that may not be your cup of tea. I wish that had been available for me back in the day.

Your school's counseling center is there to help you through the anxiety issues associated with school -- god knows there are plenty. I went to mine during grad school.  College is stressful, and every single student hits stressors at some point or several.  Just be aware that the counselors are there for you and you're paying for this service already.

I give this advice to any of my students who need it. You deserve to be as healthy as you can be during your first year of college, so please take advantage of all the resources available to you.

Good luck.
 I was definitely going to do that before any big commitment things! Thank you! This is super helpful. I may be missing something, but what are RDS? Oh! I'm sorry. RDS = resources for disabled students.
