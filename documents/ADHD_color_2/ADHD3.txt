How do you manage falling asleep at night? I've had trouble falling asleep my whole life. Now it's at the point where I don't actually fall asleep at least  until 2 or 3 in the morning. Even if I have to be up at 6 for work. 

I will think of something completely random while im laying down trying to go to sleep and I will HAVE to figure out the answer. I turn the tv on to something I’ve seen a million times and close my eyes while focusing on the words instead of my thoughts. The tv light can be bothersome at times tho so in those times I use music instead. Basically anything I can focus on instead of thoughts is helpful for me.  I posted this somewhere earlier, it's a weird thing to do I guess, but reading this sub all day has shown me I'm a weird dude. 

1. Fan, 2 fans maybe. White noise isn't the same. Fan apps are garbage. My wife shuts the fans off when she gets out of bed, I wake up pretty instantly. 

2. If I'm tired but my brain wont stop, focus on the color black. When I close my eyes I usually convert to like visual thought? And just smack that crap out of my head just thinking about an endless sea of the color black. Mind starts to wander? Back to black, over and over. Like staring at a black piece of paper with no markings on it, that you cant see the edges of because it's so huge, so dont even bother. Just black.

Usually takes about 5 minutes if I do that.

3. Have a routine that means it's time for sleep. Have a routine in general. That's my problem now, I dont stick to my routines because they get boring or I miss one of the things I'm supposed to do and it screws up the rest of the day, so I just quit. Just didnt know what was going on until a few weeks ago. Listening to music (via earphones) can sometimes help but usually what I do which doesn't just sound unhealthy it definitely is unhealthy is that I just do things (tv,phone or laptop usually)until I can't not sleep... I've had insomnia my whole life, and started medicating it 16 years ago (early adulthood). This year I decided to get off medication, and separately started meditating. 

Incidentally, mediation has virtually eliminated toss and turn nights. Most of the time I just lay in bed and start meditating, and then I fall asleep that way. If I can manage to get to the bed, in the dark, laying down... I will close my eyes and wait for my eyes adjust to the dark behind my eyelids.

It takes a couple of boring minutes for the imprints of light and life to fade from my vision, but then I start to see floating shapes and colors in the blackness. 

Then, I try as best as I can to stay focused on watching the darkness, and not any mundane life crap. I don't need to meditate or stay still or any of that hard stuff, but I will actively watch the darkness behind my eyelids for pictures and images. It's a trick because it feels active, and is sometimes very interesting, but it lulls me.

Often enough, I'll fall asleep doing that. I listen to lets’s plays while falling asleep. It’s not even that I’m a huge gaming fan, but usually let’s plays have the perfect combination of constant and unimportant ramble. I don’t watch them (the light from the phone is bad for falling asleep) I just turn on YT and then close the case of my phone.
You could also listen to an audiobook or a podcast or something of the sorts. Music can help too, but I don’t recommend it too much because upbeat music will get you excited instead of sleepy.

Make sure though that you still take some time out of your day, maybe after lunch or before leaving the house in the morning, where you just sit in absolute silence and let yourself think. Suppressing thoughts all the time is also not a good thing. If you can, intense workouts always make me tired enough to fall asleep pretty quick. That would explain why I tend to sleep better with music... I can’t have any lights on in my room or it drives me crazy! I do the same thing. I’ve watched seinfeld, scrubs, family guy or American dad every single night for as long as I can remember. I have two fans, and I listen to music, definitely helps. Only problem is when the playlist ends, I wake up, but that kind of helps my to plug my phone in and most of the time I can quickly go back to sleep. That’s exactly what I do. I don’t fall asleep until I literally just pass out.  Close eyed hallucinations. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-eye_hallucination
I call it brain TV 😁 I completely understand the lights thing so yeah if music helps then I’d do that! Really just focusing on something that will distract you enough that your thoughts aren’t the only thing there. The keeping your eyes shut thing is really important though. After just closing my eyes and “pretending” to sleep I’ve noticed I fall asleep much faster. 

Podcasts and audiobooks have also helped me in the past although sometimes those can be dangerous because I find them so interesting they lead into questions that keep me up >_<  I too often forget to watch and lose to racing thoughts. That is awesome! One of the "see also" links calls it "prisoners' cinema." Eep. Ugh, my cell mate never shuts up.  I hate being trapped inside my own head.
