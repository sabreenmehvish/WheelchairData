Adderall question Not extremely important, but I'm curious. 

I was just recently diagnosed with ADHD and am trying to figure out the correct dosage. So my doc just upped my dosage to 20mg of adderall xr. When I got the prescription (which I had to wait 2 days for because they said they didn't have it ðŸ˜ ) they had it in two different bottles (which seemed odd).. in one bottle all the pills just say "G454" and in the other bottle the pills say "M. Amphet Salts 20mg"

I know they are both 20mg adderall xr, I was just curious if the different markings mean that they are different in anyway? Like are they different brands? Should I expect anything different from the two?  Without knowing the colors of the capsules it's hard to tell. Generally just different generic manufacturer is all.  
Everyone has different experiences.  Sometimes one generic works better than another. Keep mental or physical notes on each one    They are orange. Everything about them look the same except for the markings on them.
