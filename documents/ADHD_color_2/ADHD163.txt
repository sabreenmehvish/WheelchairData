Severe ADHD going back to school at 31. Need help with figuring out how this is gonna work out. Hi, I'm a 31 year old female and found out about a year ago I have severe ADHD (although I'm not hyperactive). I'm planning on going back to school in January and need some help with organizing my thoughts and figuring out how to remember what I learn in class & while at study. Any suggestions for books? Websites? Anything? Any help would be really appreciated! I was in your boat a few years ago. First off, medication is my #1. I don't know how I got through grad school without it.

Don't know about books, but I use these websites:

* http://simplynoise.com/ for white noise
* https://macfreedom.com/ to combat internet distraction (ugh reddit!)
* http://www.studyblue.com/ for flash cards

And for day to day:

* day planner, including to-do lists
* taking pics of things I need to do and emailing them to myself
* one-note for note taking
* recording lectures (either with voice recorders or webcam)
* getting professors to post lectures online (if they use ppt or other tech lectures)

And for studying the single best thing I've learned is to take vivid notes of my reading with lots of different colored pens. I'll even draw little cartoons and pictures to illustrate concepts. Sometimes I'll write questions in one color on one side of the paper, and the answers in another color on the other side. It's not for understanding, although I'm sure it helps for that, but for storage of coded memory. Works great if you're a visual learner. I will do the same thing sometimes with audio, by asking and answering questions on a voice recorder, so that I can use it to test myself during commutes. 

Oh and invest the time in memory techniques like the mind palace. It's a pain to set up but invaluable once you get used to it.

Good luck! You can get it done. :)

*edit- formatting* I'm 30 currently going back to school in a similar situation as you.

If you're pursuing anything that requires heavy math, I suggest you brush up on your math skills at http://www.khanacademy.org .

Not doing math for so long has made me slow, but I am slowly getting back to my high school level of "ability".

I would also time out my meds to peak during my hardest classes. This may not be applicable if you take time-release meds.

I suggest you spend time in the morning to plan out your day everyday. I felt having a daily plan helped me prioritize my work load so things did not seem overwhelming.

In addition to the earlier point, schedule classes so you aren't overburdened. Tips, like only one math and science class per semester helps you not overdo things. Check your school for their services for students with disabilities. This is where I first got tested for ADHD and when it was confirmed, I had access to special privileges like longer test times, private testing spaces, note takers in class, all sorts of other little things that were offered to help me succeed. I was in exactly your situation. [Driven to Distraction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0307743152?pc_redir=1406818531&robot_redir=1) and [You mean, I'm not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0743264487?pc_redir=1406837346&robot_redir=1) both helped me.

Sleep a lot. Remove as much sugar as you can from your diet.  Drink ALL the water. Have some loving support. Good luck. I am in your situation right now.  And thank God for the meds.  i cannot finish anything i start....  So thank God for actually getting help. I have severe ADHD and I finished my PhD in 2005. Student Services should be your first stop. You will need your diagnosis and a list of recommended modifications from your psych or psychologist. Get a day planner. Sure you can set reminders on your phone or iPad but a visual weekly and monthly planner is a must. Have your dispensing dr give you a prescription for evening meds. It was a life saver for me. Good luck, you can do it! ALSO!

[There was an AskReddit recently about studying](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2b0yf8/good_students_how_do_you_go_about_getting_good/cj0qre2)

I'm trying to apply some of the methods now, and they have been really helpful... It's a lot to read through. But very worth it!

Consider looking into an ADHD counselor/asking your school if they have any suggestions for them available  Your milage may vary, but for me: 

Write lists everyday about what you need to achieve the next day. If you decide to do this, but then don't, then you've got no chance at uni. 

If you can do the list thing ever night, then it is like being a fucking super hero. 

... I've only managed to make the list a couple of times, and have been kicked out of uni around 4 times. 30 yrs old now. 

EDIT: medication is pretty good too. Watch that video that's linked in the side-bar.

Also: Lectures are horrible, but lecture slides are amazing and I can eat them up at a phenomenal rate. And try to shut the fuck up in tutorials once in a while. 

And: Make sure you actually read how the assessment works. I got kicked out one time because I missed a couple of tutes, and was shocked to find out that meant I failed the course.  Plan on part-time school for this semester to ease your way back into it. Or go head-in and take out a loan to live off (for a backup plan) and work part-time or not at all. Whatever you can do. First year in college was at 29, graduated at 31 with great scores. Only cause I was on meds, & was genuinely interested in the subject matter (mental health).  Welcome to the club I will be 30 when I start graduate school when I get into school. I also have ADHD and am HI (hardcore). I am nervous too. I got through undergraduate school without medication. I did so buy writing everything down and being vigilant about organization. I developed a system and never let myself veer from it even for a moment.  I am going to go to graduate school medicated and utilizing the vigilance I have developed over the years which has often been misdiagnosed as OCD in the past.  Are you me?! I'm also a woman turning 31 this fall, was diagnosed a year ago, am going back to school around the same time and am inattentive. Also been stressing about going back to school. All I can offer is *hugs*!  Is mind palace a web site or resource or is it the technique for memorization where you place things, like, spatially in your imagination? Awesome list and I prefer brown noise over white personally, especially on oscillate Seriously white noise app on your phone for when you're reading. Absolutely helps!  Try this: http://patrickjmt.com/ WOW! I did this and I can't believe how much help they offer! Thanks! I LOVE the book 'Driven to Distraction'! I haven't read the other book yet though, I'll be on that. Thanks for your response! I love lists, only way I can get things done. I'm not on any meds specifically for ADHD and want to try it without first, then if it is just too much for me, I'll try the meds. Thanks for your reply!
 Good job! Any job I have I always have to write EVERYTHING down or I just completely forget it. Thanks for your response!
 What did you find?

You should create a separate post for the rest of us ADHD sufferers. My experience was 10+ years ago, so I'm guessing they've come even further than when I was still there. Good one. I personally was very afraid of the meds but Dexamphetamine is what I'm on, and it's just a nice experience. Apparently quite old, very safe.
