Organisational Apps? Hey what apps do you use to help you organise your day? Definitely try Habitica. It frames your day-to-day planning, goals, and habits like a videogame. You level up, gain special gear, and there's even a special guild for ADHD with unique daily goals!

This is the only one I've been able to consistently use. Good luck! Google calendar and Google keep. I use Cozi. Itâ€™s geared to families, but is the one that I always come back to. You can color code for family members (would work to color code work/school/home tasks, too), set repeating tasks, grocery and to-do lists. The paid version has a birthday feature and menu planning.  Calendar for appointments and events, obviously. I also like the "reminder" feature for tasks I'd otherwise forget about ("take out the trash" at 8pm on Monday nights)

Google Keep makes for great checklists. I can make separate to-do lists for "today" and "this week" and "whenever", and I have "today" list on my phone home screen. I also keep tons of random notes on it, from stuff I used to write on sticky notes, to things that are just impossible for me to remember, like my license plate number. (I'm still not great at actually getting through my checklists, but it's better than a pile of sticky notes)

I also like Daylio mood tracker. I started using it as a way to be more self-aware of my feelings, but it's also good for accountability cuz it asks you "what did you do today?". It's not much of all annoyance cuz it only takes like 30 seconds to fill out and you can set the reminders for whenever you want. Consider a bullet journal it can be quite relaxing and it will help you with the scheduling
