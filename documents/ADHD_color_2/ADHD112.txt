On personal appearance - how do you dress professional or nicely? I'm not a girly girl, but I'm trying to be more aware of my appearance, a) because it will be important to be professional in the workplace, b) because I know it changes the way people view you and how seriously people take you and c) because I kind of got obsessed with fashion and makeup over the last couple months probably motivated by d); because attractive people exist. 

I have recently started meds (in the last ~7 months, the last ~3 months taking them regularly on the same drug and dose) and actually have been able to establish a morning routine that includes some makeup. But my clothes are wrinkled often because I forget to fold them, my hair is either down and still wet when I get to class or in a ponytail (and gets changed 20 times a day when I fidget with it), and getting together a vaguely matching outfit (well, "matching", unfortunately, since my style skills are 0) takes me literal ages. 

YouTube tutorials have simply proven to me there is SO MUCH I'm SUPPOSED TO DO, especially as a girl, and I've only recently graduated from the "showering daily and wearing deodorant and maybe shaving when the hair gets itchy."

How do I present myself as an adult/Grown Woman while dealing with ADHD, basically?  First off: chill. There is nothing you HAVE to do as an adult/grown woman and it sounds like you are way freaking yourself out. You're still in school. What field? Appearances matter, let's not lie, but if you're going into geology vs law vs business vs biotech, you're gonna have different concerns.

**Most important**

* Don't smell. Doesn't necessarily mean daily showering, but does mean clean pits and crotch, showering is easy, soapy towel works fine some mornings with clean clothes.
* No stains on clothes. Rewearing is fine. Anyone who washes their bras after one use can come do my laundry too. (Sports bras are an exception but those usually end up wet and that's gross to rewear.) 
* Good breath (gum)
* Deodorant (purell and a mini one in your backpack if you sweat a lot) Get one that works with your own personal scent/BO whatever, don't cake it on.
* If you need to destink fast, rubbing alcohol sprayed on with water will freshen stuff up and kill the stinky bacteria for a while. Not great for regularly, just fine to get you through a class or two after that allnighter, wouldn't recommend for something REALLY smelly or on a hot day.

**Clothes**

* Buy clothes that fit well and can't wrinkle. My clothes live in hampers and drawers and these magic clippy hanger things so I never fold anything. Anything that TRULY needs folding goes on a real hanger. 
* Stick to colors you like and work well on you, whatever that means for you
* Don't buy a ton of stuff you don't like--go for thrift stores, try things on, figure out what you like and don't. Some super professional stuff no one really likes, but you will LOOK unprofessional and awkward in clothes you hate and feel awkward in.
* If you find something you like, buy a bunch. I have a huge number of tanktops that are the same style, a couples identical pairs of jeans. Nice tanktop with a sweater or cardigan on it and pants that fit goes a long way.

**Hair**

* Get a cut that requires almost no styling. They do exist, find a stylist and ask, or check Pinterest. 
* Microfiber towels. Squeeze the water out of your hair, no damage, dries way, way, way faster. 
* If you wanna learn styles, bobby pins or headbands are great and easy and look cute. Bobby pins have tons of options and also provide you with infinite fidgets and "legit" fidget excuses. 
* Fidget with your hair in the direction it is already going, messes it up less.

**Makeup**

* Eyebrows go a huge fucking way.
* Mascara
* Lip gloss in a natural tone
* But yeah, eyebrows that have had SOMETHING done, mascara, and lip gloss is enough to look ~polished~ with zero effort, especially if you just buy doubles of your mascara and lip stuff and keep some in your purse, your backpack, and at home.




Shit like matching, makeup, all that stuff? Not as important. What's important is something that is SUSTAINABLE for you. If YOU care about matching, then awesome, but otherwise, the rest of the world largely doesn't care as much, again, depending on the field. 

Some mornings I do contacts, full face of makeup, cute mini fast updo with bobby pins and a nice outfit. Some mornings I am, in fact, conscious, I do not smell, my jeans are zipped shut, and my shirt is just fine even though I wore it yesterday but the sweater is clean and new and that's as good as the world is getting and I have a scarf in my hair because fuck that noise, you know?  I work in a law firm and as support staff (Im a Caseworker/case management assistant) our attire is business casual.  I'm not into a lot of prints so this is what's in my closet (I just purged 4 garbage bags of clothing):
**Black**
2 pairs of pants
Maxi skirt
3 knee length (or past knee) skirts
2 long sleeved black shirts
2 short sleeved
2 tank tops
2 cardigans
1 blazer
**Gray** - same
Same long sleeved shirts and v neck short sleeves in a couple colors (navy blue, burgundy, olive green, teal, white)
**Shoes**
Flats
Boots
Booties
Sandals
**Scarfs**
Different patterns to spice up outfit
I then take a bottom, any top of color will match and pair with a cardigan or blazer (several different colors) and add a nice scarf.
If it's jeans friday, then I have a blue, black or gray pair of jeans to do the same thing.  
I pick out my clothes the night before and done.
Hair - I use an old t shirt to wrap it up in after a shower and it dries without frizzies. Easy to maintain haircut (shoulder length Bob).
Makeup - I wear foundation due to acne scars but I just use some eyeliner, mascara, neutral lip gloss.  Some days I do eyeshadow if I have time.

Keeping it simple with colors rather than patterned clothes work good for me.  I always get compliments and it's always professional looking.  I wear earrings a lot and a watch but that's it for jewelry.


 1) I'd just like to add looking into capsule wardrobes. It makes life so much easier. 

2) Also, just remember that the more you do something the easier it becomes. Just get back on the horse if you've had a bad day and try again the next. 

3) pick your clothes out the night before and get yourself a "valet." You can use it to prearrange your outfit for the next day and also for hanging clothes those clothes you've worn, but are not dirty yet.

 Get one of those steamers to help with the wrinkled clothes. Mine is a life saver. 

Showering at night helps with having wet hair during the day, also gives you more time in the morning to get yourself together.

For professional wear, find The One perfect skirt and The One perfect top and get several of each in different colors. There's one skirt that I have four of: two in black and two in gray. There's this perfect blouse that goes with it extremely well: I have two in white, two in blue, a green one, and a purple one. Sometimes I feel like a cartoon character, but people only notice that you're wearing the same stuff if it really stands out.

 1) Wrinkles: First of all, hang your clothes up. Get some wrinkle releaser and spray them the night before (laying out your clothes is a good habit to get into anyway). If your clothes have been living on the floor and have super sharp wrinles, throw them into the dryer, which will soothe wrinkles. Then spray wrinkle releaser and hang them up. DO NOT spray wrinkle releaser and then put them into the dryer. 

2) Get a blowdryer. Blow-dry that hair. Or, start showering at night. (On the plus side, your mornings are now faster!) 

3) Stop touching your hair. Style once and don't touch it. This takes effort, but it can be done! Buy yourself a fidget so you don't touch your hair. Don't touch your hair or face during the day, it messes up your hair/makeup and tends to look childish. 

4) Don't worry about doing everything a Youtube tutorial says you need to do beyond practicing good hygiene and having a generally neat and clean professional appearance.

Now, as to clothes: I wear a uniform. Not a literal uniform, but I pick a style and I stick with it. This is the easiest way to dress and appear professional. Here's how to do it: 

1) **Pick Your Neutral Color**: So, depending on your skin tone, and what color you like, that's going to be black, white, gray, or some kinda khaki/tan. Black and white are the easiest; gray, khaki, and tan are a little harder because not everything is the same shade of gray or khaki/tan. I use black, black is easy. It doesn't work for everyone.

2) **Pick Your Style**: So this depends on how formal/informal your workplace is. Is it business? Business casual? Maybe if these words don't really mean much, look at the other women you work with. Do they normally wear blazers or suits? Stockings and heels? Maybe it's a blouse-and-cardigan with skirts and pants office. Or maybe it's a nice-shirt-and-nice jeans type place. You can even write down what you see others wearing. I work in biz casual, so I wear skirts, button-downs, and cardigans with flats. Tights when its cold, but no stockings otherwise. 

3) **Pick Your Basics**: First, don't buy things you're not going to wear just because they are "fashionable". If you hate skirts, for instance, then don't buy them. They'll collect dust in your closet. You are going to buy just a few pieces, and you can buy them 1-2 at a time if you like and slowly build your professional wardrobe. 
-Bottoms (skirts, pants, or a mix of the two) 
-Tops (blouses, button-downs, or more casual shirts) 
-Overlayers (cardigans, blazers, other sweaters)
-Stockings or socks if necessary 
-Shoes (flats, mids, or high heels, depending on what you like)

4) **Put It All Together**: 
 Now, generally, people put their neutral color on the bottom (skirts, pants), but if your neutral color is light (light grey, light tan, or a lighter khaki) or white, you might want to put your neutral color on the top. 

Let's just assume your neutral color is black. You would buy all your bottoms (aim for 2-4 total, you don't have to buy them all at once) in black. There's no point in buying multiple bottoms that look too much alike, but try to get similar weight fabrics so that your tops will match all of them. Choose more "timeless" cuts that are not too fashion-forward or "new". They tend to fall out of fashion quickly.

Now, your tops (at least 5 to start with, one for every day, although I'm assuming you probably have some in your closet already) can be in whatever colors or patterns you like--you can do black on black as well. Again, choose more "timeless" cuts. Button down blouses don't really go out of style, for instance. 

Your overlayers (1-2) will be in your neutral color and different styles or weight, like a lighter one for fall and a heavier one for winter, etc. Start with the season you're currently in.  

Shoes (1-2 pairs) will be in your neutral color. Make sure they match in texture and style--for example, a pair of dressed-down, casual flats may not work well with a skirt-suit. 
Stockings or socks/shoe liners can be skin-tone nude.

To flip-flop with your neutral on top, pick your tops to be the same color neutral (so all white, for instance) and then you can pick whatever color bottoms you want (especially useful if you like colorful or patterned skirts). You can go with your neutral color overlayers, or another light neutral (like gray + white, for instance). Neutral on top is a little more difficult, but not impossible. 

5) Congrats, you have a wardrobe! From there, it is easy to add a few pieces here and there that don't fit the mold (if you want to experiment), but don't go crazy with the colors--it quickly becomes overwhelming and difficult to match and find outfits. Because your bases are neutral color, they should all be pretty mix-and-match. You can always try cross-posting this over at /r/femalefashionadvice  Thanks! That's reassuring. I also think that since I have a project I am procrastinating on, this is suddenly way more interesting than it would be normally :) 

I really like your way of explaining things, it's very straightforward and easy to process. 

I am hoping to end up in medicine or medical/clinical research. I'm currently in biology as a student, and I find that those students and profs dress better than we do, as a faculty. My profs alternate between "business casual" and "I think it's probably clean?" while med school profs tend to alternate between "business casual" and "television lawyer/doctor" I attend a competitive, high-ranking school with one of the best-ranked med schools in the country attached to one of the bigger hospitals, so I guess that must be part of it.

I was sitting in a meeting with several other students and a prof with whom I would like to end up doing grad school or getting contacts through, and I realized that I was the most casually and messily presented one there. Not something I would have probably noticed before meds, but it did make me realize that there is an appropriate garb for work and meetings, and it's not pyjamas in that field. 

I really really like your advice. It's like you are an older, more experienced me coming back from the future to tell me the things I actually care about instead of the millions of weird things makeup gurus care about. Do eye bags really matter if they aren't actually black? Was I supposed to worry about the lines beside my nose? Because I don't. Meanwhile, being and smelling clean is important, and looking like I have my shit a little bit together is too. 

What field do you work in? not even a girl (am a dude)... but even my neanderthal man-child brain can tell this is good advice. nice work! you even got bold text an bullet points and stuff... hey, you don't happen to have ADHD, do yah!? ;) I asked on r/askwomenadvice and found the answers were nice! but not detailed enough and they skimmed over a lot. They also seemed... kind of... I don't know. The answers were great! And people were helpful, but people here explain things in a point by point way that makes more sense to me. 

Thanks, though! Not the same person, but here's my take. I work in insurance, and my office has business casual as the upper bound for dress code - my boss *might* wear a suit if the really big execs are visiting. I'm trying to get a promotion, so I aim for just under bizcas most days. 

Eye bags do NOT matter unless you hate the way they look. If I have time for makeup it's usually mascara and lipstick, maybe a bit of blush/highlight or eyeshadow. If you're self conscious about your skin, you might *want* to wear foundation or concealer, but it's not mandatory. 

For clothes, +1000 to buying multiples of things you like that fit well. I have 3 pairs of black slacks and I just rotate through those, washing when needed (every 3 wears or so usually). People might think I wear the same pants every single day, but nobody's ever asked and *I* know they're (reasonably) clean, so what tf ever. I have a couple button down shirts and blouses, some niceish tank tops, a couple cardigans, and a couple blazers. Everything goes with everything, so getting dressed is mainly a matter of figuring out what *didn't* I wear yesterday (simple - what's in a heap on the floor instead of the hamper/hung back up where it belongs?). If you start wearing "work clothes", try to get in the habit of changing out of them when you get home. This increases the amount of time you get to wear leggings, and decreases the chances of spilling food on them. Remember that with medicine most things will either be covered or be scrubs, and for research, you're going to be not public-facing most of the time or in a lab. 

Eye bags totally don't matter and are super normal, as are nose lines. By all means experiment with makeup if you want, I certainly enjoy it (and not surprisingly for me it's usually all or nothing ;)). I always recommend trying makeup on a day you don't have to go anywhere so if you look weird or get freaked out by your own reflecton you aren't running around hyperfocusing on how weird your makeup is and how uncomfortable you are and trying to fix it yourself in class by plucking your eyebrows without being able to see... not that I've, uh, done that, or anything. ;)

The type of makeup stuff you're describing is the type of thing I do for a dance show, where it will take a LOT of layers and effort, etc. Daily stuff, even if I do foundation, is way fast, stuff I can put on with my fingers and I don't have to really fix, etc.

As for field, I have a bachelor's in math and work as a massage therapist, sooooo.

Really the best advice is experiment, find the stuff YOU like how it looks and feels good in, and the stuff that is appropriate for work and is clean/comfy etc, get a bunch, and that will do the best pretty universally. Someone can be wearing the best executed makeup and most flattering outfit ever but if they feel weird in it, they're going to LOOK weird.  My goal is always being clear AND giving the advice that is legit accessible to anyone even on the days where we just fucking can't--e.g., purell in your armpits, stick of deodorant, rubbing alcohol on clothes to get through the day :P None of this "On your bad days just reorganize your closet by sleeve length for best productivity!" shit :D I literally have like 15 almost identical tanktops. It helps that they're all from the kids section at Target and weirdly are the only tank tops I've ever found that are long enough for my weird torso AND boobs and still fit well, which seems... unnerving as I buy them in the little girls' department BUT. 

I often wear the same jeans, etc., many days in a row. But they're in great shape and heavy denim, so! 

And OP, if you are worried about your skin--figure out how to improve the skin itself (r/skincareaddiction is great), then makeup. For makeup, find something you can do fast and easy and lasts and matches your skin supersupersupersuper well.
