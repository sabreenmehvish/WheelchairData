Google Calendar best practices? I am trying to figure out how to use google calendar effectively to keep my adhd life organized. Do you guys have any best practices?  If so what are they?
I am tired of the money suck from other apps and forgetting to open lots  apps which have a singular function. I have so many day planners that I have never used and I know that since I keep my smartphone with me there is a better chance of google being used.  By itself, google calendar wasn't that usable for me.  Then I tried and liked any.do which is a to-do list app, and then was offered CAL, which is an app that combines google calendar and any.do and has a great widget.  Now everything gets easily recorded.

Hopefully without sounding too much like someone paid to say it, you should check out any.do and CAL.  All free, btw. I use Google Calendar for pretty much everything. It works on my phone and computer, synced by cloud. I can access it anywhere. I can set reminders, put in addresses that link straight to my gps,  snip dates from websites and automatically put then in my calendar.  I like to use the email alert feature that google calender has. You can set email alerts (I think it can text?) for important events. I've been using Google calendar for years to keep organized. Wall callendars, organizers, etc get forgotten about after a short time or I procrastinate and forget to write things down. Google helps since it syncs everywhere.

I use multiple calendars for different types of reminders and the colors help me quickly see what the day/week/month holds. 

For example, I have a calendar dedicated just to bills. I set these as repeating events and I put the event to read "Comcast - $55" for example.  This tells me right away how much I have budgeted or am expected to pay. I gave this calendar the color red since it's very important I pay attention to these evens. Other things in this calendar are when my promotional period for a cable promotion ends so I know when the bill will change. Cell phone contract end dates and other changes that will affect my bills is also included. Almost forgot, I also have when my auto registration is due. Very important since they remind you so early you forget when it comes due.

Other calendars I use are as follows:
- Birthdays I Will Never Remember (not everyone is on facebook)
- Couch Potato Reminders (reminds me when a movie or TV show I want to see is out)
- My Work Schedule
- My SO ' s work schedule 
- My School Schedule and Events (assignments, class changes, etc)

Of course I also have my default calendar where I add things like going out with friends, my family being out of town, and doctors appointments. The important thing is to find what groupings of events fit your life and what calendars you need.  If medicine reminders are big, you could set a calendar just for doses and enable sms reminders.

The important thing is to set up reoccurring events so daily/monthly/yearly events are always present. Also, pay attention to the settings and Google labs. There are some tweaks that can help a lot. Default reminders for new events so it's easier when adding an event help a lot.

Most of the time I only have some calendars visible on my phone/computer. Some of the hidden ones I don't need cluttering up my view, but the reminders via email and sms still work. A good time to have less distractions on the screen.

I hole this helps and I may think of more tomorrow since I'm writing this after waking up at 330 am.  What us the catch? Nothing is fully free Saves my life. I always double book myself & it stops me all the time - when I actually emember to enter things in it... Yup! You can change the time too. So I remind myself like a week in advance than up the time. I could never manage that many calendars! 1 is plenty! Have you ever used the text appointment feature where you send a text and google creates an appointment? I like the multiple calendars for purposes. I do the same thing with birthdays
 Probably just data mining.  But they can have my digital brain clutter.   I have Google Now on my lock screen, and upcoming calendar dates show up, so even if I don't open the app I have subconscious reinforcement when I'm checking the time. The beauty is once you set most of them up, you rarely have to touch them. Hiding the ones you don't want to see right away helps too.  Think of it like removing the excess clutter from your screen so you don't have so many distractions. How do you set it to do that?
