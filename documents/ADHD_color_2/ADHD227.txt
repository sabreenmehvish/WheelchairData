overlooked aspect of ADHD? I've been in trying to write this post for about three hours now lol and cannot for the life of me phrase anything correctly or communicate simply what i mean, so instead ill just leave some stuff here and see if anyone gets me

This is a realization related to sensory sensitivity etc., and the fact that as horrible and annoying as it can be, it helps us see the world in a different way than others do, and in a way that's extremely beautiful.

What made me realize that this aspect of myself might come from ADHD was **this poem**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC-Mln7itbM 
When i saw it for the first time, what brought me to tears were the lines;
**I can see god's signature on every flower petal.**

**I remember the cut, the color, and the texture of the dress you wore that day, the saline sweetness of your sweat, and every switchback curve in your beautiful smile.**

**My mind is full of visions so breathtakingly beautiful, god-- I wish you could see them too.**

Last year, a long long time before i had even a single thought about ADHD, i wrote this:

"The birds, I feel them sing. My heart, I taste its beat. I see the wind intertwined in the air, I hear the sweat on my upper lip. I smell bubbling laughter. I see flowers."

Obviously, it isn't literal, but it's referring to how i've always perceived the world, and seen and felt things so much deeper than others do. A tree to me is never just a tree, I see every impression and mark on it, every leaf, and I see everything its interconnected with in terms of the world. Sun streaming in through windows makes me feel infinite, it becomes a chemical change in my body where everything looks and feels different, including everyone around me. Music is and always will be incredibly amazing because every note and tone and lyric enters my whole body and fully consumes me. I guess its all sort of like being stoned hahaha.
Again, not sure how to phrase all of this, but in time I've come to realize that other people don't have this. I have soooo many elaborate ideas about different things and so many different ways that I see the world, but I can never communicate them. 

That's always made me feel so disconnected from everyone else-- like I was in some bubble of this magically overwhelming world but nobody else appreciated what i was trying to say because it didnt make sense.
For as long as i can remember, i've felt an extreme disconnect from others because *externally* i come off a certain way (loud, goofy, eccentric, hyper; always making stupid jokes) but internally i have so many more things going on. this has been extremely difficult for me in relationships where i've tried to communicate different ways that my mind works but people just haven't understood or wanted to accept it, so

Realizing this parallel was extremely profound to me, and I was wondering if it even is related to ADHD or if anybody else can recognize themselves in it? Thoughts???  I think a common misconception about ADHD is that we're just not paying attention, in my experience of it anyways. But really, it can be just the opposite. I can be really overwhelmed by details, but sometimes it's a beautiful, life altering experience. I understand what you mean by the birds. I have felt like that many times. I can get overwhelmed by the beauty of something, particularly music, ESPECIALLY if it's live. It can make me cry (sometimes against my will) when I feel it deep within my being. But I can get so embarrassed because I never see people reacting so strongly or connect so deeply to something like I have and I've struggled against feeling like a freak for being so moved/emotional by something. So I usually under exaggerate my experience. But lately I've challenged that idea of feeling shame about crying because of music, because it's a really beautiful and profound power to connect to something so deeply that it feels like electricity charging through you. So I hope you don't feel weird or bad about it. I'm sure others experience this, too. (Maybe it's what they call experiencing the sublime?) [deleted] Synesthesia? i agree, i like the way you worded it here. 



i sometimes think i could be some type of autistic with how sensitive my senses are and how much attention to specific, sometimes random and unimportant detail i see. 



but no, perhaps it really is a side effect of my ADD brain?  I feel this, but for me, nature calms me down and I end up zoning out and just being rather than noticing every little branch or moss patch. However with people, it's the polar opposite. I can immediately recognize my dad from his cough, and I notice the tiny details in people's faces, which as an artist I find mesmerizing. I end up hyper focusing on that sometimes and find myself getting weird looks because I'm staring...  Also, when I describe someone to another person, I end up with "(Name).. the one with the (hyper specific detail about their smile or something)", which has ended up with people thinking I'm weird. While my sensitivity isn't quite like yours, I can definitely say that I feel at least a bit the same as you do, and you're not alone. holy shit, you just described me word for word. i'm always wrapped up in my own little inner world, and i often feel trapped in it. when i look at the moon i feel this immense power. when i look at a tree i study all of the leaves and the way they move. if a particular piece of music is really moving, i feel this intense wave of feeling wash over my whole body. im always always thinking about how something works, or why something is the way it is.

 i feel like my thoughts are in a different language than english and i don't know how to translate them into words when i have to explain something to someone. so i dont even try to communicate my actual thoughts anymore. to other people i come across as ditzy, boisterous, and over the top. i react to things very intensely and people always seem to think its weird, but i just feel everything so deeply. on the inside i'm analytical and thoughtful. im terrified no one will ever know who i actually am because i dont know how to communicate my inner self very well. "Sun streaming in through windows make me feel infinite, it becomes a chemical change in my body" yasss..

Every thing i experience with my senses feels like it touches my soul and every cell in my body. 

Today isn't even a "nice" day. It's cloudy and somewhat cold. But just looking out at the trees outside my window I don't only see them I can imagine the smell of the rain they got soaked with this morning, i imagine the cold air and birds chirping. 

It's like a loving hug for the soul, I should really put the phone down more often just to pay attention to these things.
Like you said, it feels like a high and I can confidently say that if I do this more often, quality of life for me would increase significantly.

So thank you for the reminder â™¡  I remember feeling like this when I looked out my window as the sun had just begun to rise. I was filled with an incredible feeling of just awe and amazement. It always staggers me that we live on a world with so many living creatures, so much beauty and wonder. It felt amazing.  this was really beautiful to read and makes me feel less alone.<3 
(now i'm thinking the experience probably also has something to do with emotional dysregulation). 
i love this part of myself, objectively its such a special and amazing thing to have, and i wouldn't trade it for the world. i think the sadness about it comes from how disconnected it makes me feel from others, but in realizing that it might come from adhd that's sort of gone away more; it gives me a positive aspect of my brain to focus on and makes me grateful for adhd to have given me something so beautiful in all of the shittiness.  yes yes me too!!!! this made me happy i have this with people as well! it seriously makes the world a lot more interesting though. neurotypicals must be so BORED all the time hahah wow, you really really put it into the perfect words, i'm with you 500% on this.
(this sub is seriously life-changing). i'm very grateful though because i've learned to accept myself as special and appreciate my own thoughts and experiences, so the need to communicate all of it has died down a lot, but i still have the same fear that nobody will ever truly know me. its really not a nice feeling:( you phrased it so so so so perfectly (and helped me realize that i need to get off my phone more as well). i feel way less alone, thank you<333
