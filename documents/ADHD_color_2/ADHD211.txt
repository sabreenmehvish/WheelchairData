Why do other people do not want to investigate if they may be ADHD, after friends/family found out they were ADHD? So it is my belief that ADHD has some genetic component.  I also believe that certain jobs attract certain types of personalities.  Same thing with certain activities attracting certain types of personalities.  Because we form our relationships from people in our environment, it is likely ADHD people naturally clump together and thus ADHD people will have more friends with ADHD than the general population.

So when a person has recently been diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and he/she similar behaviors in their friend or family members, and suggest they may be ADHD like them and they should probably just ask their doctor, they respond with something like "I don't want to be tested!" or "Okay. Followed by quickly changing the subject."

Why are people so afraid to self investigate?  I just don't get it. Nobody wants to admit they have a neurological disorder/mental illness. Same goes for their kids. if my father did take the medication he would have to admit to himself that he was a gigantic dick all these years. 

His ego couldn't take it. so there. 

they don't consciously logically think about it. it's a self-protection mechanism. read about the correlation between adhd and narcissism.

it is my belief that if you walk through life feeling bad and you can't find the reason why your mind starts protecting your ego by building up the illusion that everyone else is the reason for you feeling bad. *TL:DR* , **After giving some time for me to think about it. I explain why this really gets to me and I explain how your brain works with a hands on graphical analogy that a child should be able to comprehend.**

Part of why this is exasperating is that this is so simple.  There is nothing really wrong with these people, with anybody, with me.  All you are missing when you have adhd are a basic chemical your body needs.

Think of the neurotransmiters in your brain as 4 simple shapes that are different colors.  The color and the shapes do not matter but I am going to give them colors to make it easier to remember and focus.

Red Star is Dopamine

Blue Circle is Norepinephrine

Green Square is Serotonin

Orange Triangle is Choline

Your brain cells are little kids in a room.  These kids have their mouths bandaged up as part of a game.  How these kids communicate is by passing these color shapes back in forth from one person to another person.  **Now what really makes you unique,** what makes Mike different than Sam, is the relationship brain cell A has with brain cell B.  How often they pass the color shapes between brain cell A and brain cell B, and how that person prefers passing the shapes between brain cell A and brain cell B instead of using brain cell A and brain cell C.

Now there is a set limited number of colored shapes in the room, only so much Red Star, Blue Circle, Green Square, and Orange Triangle.  Thus while there may be many brain cells in your head, they can only do so many things at once, there can only be so much communication at one time.

A person with ADHD has less of the Red Star (Dopamine) and Blue Circle (Norepinephrine) than a normal person.  Thus less of those communications takes place than a normal person.  It is hard for a person with ADHD to focus, because they have less of those chemicals in their brain.  Some forms of ADHD such as my form of inantentive ADHD can feel like they have less energy, feeling tired and exhausted; or they may be off the wall hopping mad if they have hyperactive ADHD, or if you have combined ADHD you switch between the two.  The reason hyperactive ADHD seem so hyper is the hyperactive ADHD have poor impulse control (a behavior) but also because it is hard almost impossible to focus for they don't have enough of the right color shapes to communicate (chemicals).  The part of the brain that would slow them down do not have enough of the right color shapes to tell the other brain cells to slow down.  Certain things are hard for an ADHD person for they lack the right color shapes that are necessary to actually do the thinking required to perform the task.

There is nothing fundamentally wrong about a person with ADHD, they are just not getting the right chemicals in their body that is necessary for their body to function.  You do not blame a person if their body can't absorb enough iron from their diet and thus they have anemia, you do not blame a diabetic if their body can not produce insulin. ADHD like many things with the brain, the body, and nature is a continuum.  Some "normal" people have the exact right amount of shapes they need to function, some people have almost the right amount of shapes and they can get by just fine, some people have too little amount of shapes and thus they have problems like ADHD, Depression, Anxiety or even stuff such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons (as well as hundreds of other problems for these neurotransmitters are used for alot of things and ADHD is not the only problem you can have.)

So to fix the problem with the wrong amount of shapes in the room (Red Star for Dopamine and Blue Circle for Norepinephrine) we we can do three different things.
1)  We can introduce more Red Stars and Blue Circles from an outside source (some types of Drugs such as Strattera and Wellbutrin)
2)  If it isn't possible to introduce more Red Stars and Blue Circles for we can't get our hands these shapes we can introduce other similar shapes, how about a Red Plus Sign and a Blue Octagon. The brain cells treat these "similar" materials just like they would do the Red Star and Blue Circle and while they are not quite the same, they work just as well with communication as the "normal" shapes would.  (This is how stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall work)
3)  We can teach the brain cells, the kids in the room, to pass the shapes faster or in more efficient ways (Behavior, forms of structure, some form of drugs)
All three things will fix the communication problem that our brains, I mean the kids in the room have.

I am the same person I was before on Drugs and not on Drugs.  I now just have so much more **mental** energy that I had before.  I am now capable of **getting things done** and focusing that I couldn't perform before.  Drugs do not rob me of my creativity, my inspiration, my personality, my knowledge, my enthusiasm, if anything I am more me than I was before for I can now pursue my dreams that was always inside me, bottled up, for I lacked the mental energy required to pursue my dreams.

Now a "normal" person without ADHD would not benefit from having more shapes for once you have a certain amount of shapes you can't benefit from them, and the side effects of the drugs would not be beneficial to a "normal person."

Now part of ADHD is not just the levels of different chemicals in your brain like kids with shapes in a room.  Part of it is learned behavior, due to the experience of being ADHD.  Some part of it is learned behavior throughout the years of living since the age of five or six or so to your deathbed, you know your conscious years living on this earth.

But part of what makes ADHD different than normal people is the stuff you do not have control over but your brain does to try to adapt to the ADHD, we are talking about things the brain does before the age of five or six, at the age of two to the time you were just a few cells in your mother's womb.  ADHD people are often more right brain than people who do not have ADHD, for the brain laid down neural pathways early in life to try to **compensate** to things the brain could not control.  The right side of the brain works with the left side of the brain to do things, and parts of the right brain deal with creativity, more abstract than concrete, music, colors, vision, emotions/passion, etc.  The left side of the brain deals with language, facts, logic, details.  This is one reason why ADHD people just seem so different than normal people, we see the world differently than normal people and we interact with world differently.  Drugs do not take these things away, once these neural pathways are laid down they are permanent, you will always be creative, you will always be passionate, you will always be better at visual things versus auditory things.

ADHD people also often have less neural pathways between the right and left side of the brain.  Thus it is often hard for ADHD people to try to communicate those beautiful abstract creative ideas into something that is concrete and physical.  When you have an idea that is on your tip of your tongue but you can't just find the physical words to explain the idea, that is your right brain communicating with your left brain and working together as a team, when you actually do find those words your brain did its job.  Now the only way to build those neural pathways is to try new things, and for the electrical pathways in your brain to repeat enough time that it lays down synapses.  Your brain so *frickin amazing*, it is beyond the limited word cool.

So yeah I am frustrated for I am pretty sure several of my friends and family may have ADHD.  It has messed up their lives and been so destructive.  There is little harm in investigating whether they have ADHD and if they do life gets so much better.  ADHD does not mean you have a disorder that you are fundamentally messed up, Drugs do not mean you are going to stop being you or you are going to have less than a life than you do now.  No not getting the ADHD treated is just going to lead to a more *"expletive"* up life.  And if I am wrong and you do not have ADHD, then there is little harm in the doctor of the psych telling you that your friend was wrong.

I am not a pushy person, I am not trying to be your *mother and say you are fucked up,* all I am saying I just recently found out I have ADHD and now my life is so much better.  Me and you are a lot a like, and I wouldn't be surprised you have it to.  That is why this is so frustrating. because in western society if you see a psychologist that means you're a crazy person I've got relatives with ADHD, diagnosed and undiagnosed, and I knew I fit the diagnosis for many years before I saw a doctor about it.

I didn't want to rely on drugs. It's that simple. 

Almost that simple. It took me a while to get my act together and figure out how to go about getting a diagnosis, prescription, etc. because, well, ADHD. and because ADHD feels normal because that's the way I've always been and why do I have to change? My mom is in denial that her ADHD affects her life negatively and I know exactly how she feels. She has food on the table and plenty to do and a husband who compensates for her and some people who like her, so she's good. Nevermind that half her kids don't speak to her and she can't stand to be around the grand kids for more than a few minutes and she was good at her last job but couldn't manage to do that one thing she needed to keep her job. The only reason I'm in treatment is my ADHD is tangled up with PTSD and it was killing my husband so I had to do something or lose the marriage. In some ways I still don't know all the ways ADHD is affecting my life. I understand it is a self protection mechanism, that it is their unconscious mind acting over their conscious mind.

But these same people have LOTS of coping mechanism to their adhd, they know they have lots of coping mechanisms and almost all these coping mechanisms are not really coping but instead self destructive.

Their conscious mind realizes all these coping mechanism are self destructive and they have complained before how bad they have it, and how they are stuck in a rut.  Yet given an opportunity to investigate and make their life better in an **easy and relatively harmless way** their unconscious mind rather stays in the rut instead of trying something new.

The thing that gets me, is their conscious mind even knows they are offering up excuses, yet they do it anyway.  I just don't get it.  **Any advice for me or them?** cheers for setting the tldr at the beginning! you get yourself and us Even if I know the same people have seem a doctor/psychologist, for other reasons such as depression or anxiety in the past?

Maybe that is the problem, they need to see a doctor in the past and they are now sorta better, they see the doctor as the problem instead of the state of mind they were in back then.  They don't see the doctor as a tool that helped them get better. I think that with time you will get better in finding a way to convince them slowly. Don't be too aggressive because then their subconscious will block completely. Whenever they complain about the typical adhd problems be empathetic but tell them right after that you know it from your own disorder for example. 

When you get on meds you think you have to save everyone you know and you'll realize that you can't because people don't know what is going to happen if they can't blame themselves or others all the time. 

 I think a lot of it also may be because the symptoms of ADHD can seem like things that you can just self-discipline yourself out of if you really worked hard enough. So people may just assume that they're lazy, and not that they have a disorder. A lot of people think that ADHD doesn't exist and is just an excuse to be lazy, even people who may have undiagonsed ADHD

also if you are an adult with ADHD and you are doing fine because you found the right career for you, then you may feel like you don't need to get tested
