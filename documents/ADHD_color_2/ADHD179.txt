Back on Adderall and day one is success. This is a LONG POST. Stream of consciousness. Can add a tldr if needed.

I was taking a few half doses, and today was very rewarding. 

I realized a few weeks ago , my fiance and I despite living in our new home started feeling overwhelmed with not making progress in some areas. He was sort of being dragged down by me and my weed habit / laziness habit. So, I decided to change a bit because I knew the dissaray could be tolerated by me and not by him. I sought to Change my view of house hold, chores, routine, and organization. 

I have gotten really good at organizing my virtual space (computer whiz and current software engineer with bouts of hyper focus and actually good at planning and executing what i truly want to do, it's no surprise I got into organizing virtual spaces). I wanted to apply the same thing to physical space. As well as my lifestyle and well being, and my SOs sanity. So, I revamped my Trello and created a few boards. I have one Home board that my fiance and I use. I had been using a meal planning board for a few years now and had success with it , no Adderall needed !. But with cleaning and organizing being such an overwhelming task, I procrastinated over and over again. I filled my head with ideas, vision, inspiration, and motivation, but these dopamine hits gave me no need to set forth and "do". Doing is hard and boring and not stimulating. It's just hard for me to look at space and want to improve it. I had done it a few weeks ago, with my closet and wardobe, again no Adderall. But that's because I have an excessive amount of clothes and a need to wear them .so, it was a no brainier.

The things I have been neglecting for years - regular cleaning, organizing non critical things rather than throwing them in a drawer, getting my to do list don't rather than lazing around watching TV or redditing, mostly reddit - these things are all coming a head now and I started yearning and itching to put them behind me. I of course started with the internet. The blogs, the how to, the Pinterest , etc. I had a vision and I could plan, but I couldn't remember to plan, and I wouldn't set out to get things done. It was a mess, and it's always been.

I started taking half doses of my old old Adderall. It had an improvement (though I did focus more intently on Reddit on more than one occasion rather than doing stuff). Despite the occasional angry snip, or general weirdness that's common with Adderall like being hot, not too hungry, and like I didn't want to slow down / cuddle. But I actually felt my mind was moving slower. I was able to focus on one thing at a time. I had energy, but I was able to process my thoughts and come to conclusions. I was able to rest and unwind a bit between tasks, but I kept going. I kept checking that board, reprioritizing, completing tasks , etc
 
I don't remember the last time I made a meal plan since I was neglecting even my.meal.plannkng system for years. I wanted to change it from recipe based to impromptu meal base and bulk cooking with a focus on weight loss. Adderall of course is making g this much easier. 

Wow, sorry for the rambling. I am just so happy and excited, that this medication does this. Here's a list of stuff I did today 

* Unpacked a box sitting in the bedroom(we moved in June), purged a few items, identified some storage and organizing containers we needed to accommodate items I wanted to sort through and create a place for. 
* Worked out an Amazon order with many things I needed, including cross checking against sites for deals (Amazon prices are great )
* Read up on some improvement and home making / organizing articles, getting new ideas, and making some new plans on my board
* COMPLETELY cleaned up my meal planning board - it became a complete mess from neglect
* Made a meal plan for the right amount of days I need to cook for. No recipe - bulk grill chicken and have different veggies. Shopping list included 
* Shopped for groceries
* Cooked the meal..whilst cooking the meal, I cleaned the kitchen  / dining room (dishes away, counters clean, stove top clean, swept and mopped). 
* Enjoyed the meal with my fiance (who was also getting his shit done and helping motivate me) 
* Straightened up living room, including our awesome BRAND NEW couch, which I'm in love with 
* Mopped the floors on first level(wtf!?)
* Sorted mail / recycling
* Laundry END TO END. This included not only doing it, but folding it, organizing in my wardrobe system I created from a much earlier YouTube inspiration 
* Started unpacking / purging / taking stock of one side of the room where we currently have a lot of packed and unpacked shit laying around everywhere



Yeah .wow..that's a lot.  Not everything..but major.progress. I did Reddit and waste a ton of time too lol 

I'm.impressed with myself on Adderall and with my mind set on my goals. I am very excited to keep going , doing more. 

I just had to share .

Last year, around this time i had embarked to learn how to clean. I watched you tube videos (clean with me) learned about good cleaning products etc. A few months ago, I watched a few wardobe videos, i.e. closet color/style coordination (the closet that came with this  house is insane...) and horizontally stacked" drawers so I can see all my shirts/pants when I open the door. A few weeks ago I watched videos on how to organize "stuff", closets , shelves, etc. I learned I am a "butterfly" type of organizer. Me to a T. i learned how to use trello to organize my life ans Created trello boards with helpful lists / cards.  I've taken knowledge, inspiration, planning, and a motivation to be a better me that would provide me with tangible benefits, a peace of mind, and time savings. I combined that with some discipline and the occasional Adderall boost and BOOM. Now I'm finally climbing up this insurmountable hill. One baby step at a time.

Oh, and btw, I did decide to cut back the weed. It wasn't helping me either. :)
