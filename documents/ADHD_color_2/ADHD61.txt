Academic Planner Suggestions? Does anyone have any suggestions for academic planners that are helpful, especially for people who have ADHD? 
I mostly struggle with remembering to do assignments/ assignment due dates and remembering things that aren't in my routine schedule (like meetings and irregular study groups). 
Anything you've used that helped you stay organized and remember assignments? I'm willing to pay a bit more for a planner that's going to be more helpful than just the standard ones at the store! Thanks! https://youtu.be/5hLnY9L1c-M Google calendar works well for me when I actually take the time to add things to it/set reminders. It's nice to be able to color code things. Plus, it's on my phone which I always carry with me.  iStudiezPro has been invaluable for me. It syncs to my phone, tabket, and computer, integrates with google calendar--both within the app and in my calendar app--and tracks grades and a running GPA. IDK if it is only an Apple app, though. Still crazy useful if you can only use it on a phone or iPad tho.  I'm Starting in the fall I just use a planner but make sure you get one that has tons of room and space so you don't have to write in a tiny ass box lol they make ones that offer more space I got one that was pretty cute colors on it so it would get my attention also I'm gonna use google calendar as a back up as well!

As for class I got colored note books and folders for my classes so it's easy to keep track of like blue folder blue notebook for accounting ect  I used iCal. Anything that was a due date would be an "all day event" in yellow so that it was a big bright banner at the top and easy to notice. I had all my class times in there in red, my internship in orange, personal appointments in green, work in blue, etc., and if I made social plans in advance I'd enter those too, in purple.  I use a hardcover daily pocketbook (day per page, fits in pocket) [moleskine, gonna try to use a reg journal I got on discount afterwards] and google calendar. I divide the moleskine page into four sections: stuff I jot down before the day, "did" lists- 'things Im doing after this break, and what for this break', random shit, and consistent habits/repetitive tasks (do x questions.)


In theory. I'm getting there though.


Plus a poster of all the weeks in a human life, since that's a nice and scary reminder of human mortality to see in the morning and a great way to wake up.


Good enough for me. 3rd year uni. Passion Planner is my absolute fav. It has many spots for list making and reminders. I love it and it really helps me stay on track and organize my daily, weekly, and monthly schedules much better than any other planner I've gotten. I have a six-ring personal size planner that has both monthly and weekly pages. The weekly pages let me write a quick summery of an event, along with the time, and the monthly give me a quick overview (generally events are just a time and a word or two on the monthly [11:30 Dentist] and more detailed on the weekly [11:30 Dentist, filling, w/ Dr. Shmitt, @location, bring x]) If you're doing enough stuff in a day, you may find adding daily planner helpful. I also put my schedule on my phone as well, so I get reminders on my phone as well as being able to view it conveniently when I don't have my planner/when I don't want to deal with it.   
YMMV, but I took a group class that helped me learn this system, and it's the only one that's worked for me. Hope that helps you! >[**Why the Bullet Journal is the Best Planner for ADHD Brains [5:57]**](http://youtu.be/5hLnY9L1c-M)

I've heard of bullet journaling and figured it would be wayy too messy and unstructured for my ADHD brain, but it seems kind of perfect. Thank you so so much, I think I'm going to try it! I might start using an e-calendar, but I'll most likely use it in addition to a physical planner. I'm more of a pen and paper person. Thanks! Best of luck! Oh, and a bonus: because I have it both on my iPhone and on my laptop, I could check it at any time, and update whenever something new came on my radar.   I totally am a pen and paper person too. I usually make a physical list of things I need to do and then add them to my google calendar  Thank you so much I'm so excited I got organized today and everything have a apt to go back on medication on the 17th so we will see how it goes! ðŸ’œ
