Confusion about flair that goes with username- not sure what colors mean? I'd like to add my username flair, but I'm honestly not sure what the colors mean. I figured out through searching the forum that I would be ADHD-PI, but what color? 
Additional flair question- could we have one for Educator? I have ADHD but I also teach students with ADHD and I think that would be cool to have. 
TY The colors literally don't mean anything. And we probably won't be adding new flairs. The more flairs we add, the more others will feel left out and request them and then there will be an absurd number of flairs. I have no idea what you're talking about.. Did I miss something? >Additional flair question- could we have one for Educator?

seconded It's probably just me, but whenever I view this subreddit in-browser I can't handle it. There's too much going on. 

I love the content, find it very helpful, and view it daily on AlienBlue. But I find the layout ironically hard to figure out and view in-browser.  Great! Thanks for the prompt reply! I'm trying to figure out what to put in the, little box that shows up after someone's name  I never knew you could do that on your own
