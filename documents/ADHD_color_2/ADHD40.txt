Recording / documenting work Does anyone have any recommendations for documentation and paperwork after you finish a task? I am a data analyst and I have to maintain many of the datasets and programs that I write after creating them. I am miserable at documentation, and I would rather do absolutely anything than log and record work, so my logging, recording, and organization are always lousy.

Any ideas from the community? Thanks I am the same way, and honestly haven't found a good solution yet. But, one thing that has helped is if a lot of the work you need to track is conducted via email (outlook) you can send the email to onenote for recording via the "Send to OneNote" button in outlook. There may be similar solutions for Evernote, Google keep, etc. But overall onenote has helped a lot for work related items.  Excel and color coding. That has helped me a little.  OneNote is definitely clutch for keeping things in one place, but I haven't found a way to use it for making my work / organization possible for others to follow or to track my productivity, althought it might be good to try that and see how it goes... Thanks! Would you be able to elaborate? Do you use the colors to denote the project you are working on or the type of work within a project that you do?

Thanks! For example, one of my biweekly tasks is totaling up incentives for 3 of our employees. I wouldn't be able to focus on the numbers correctly if it was all black and white so each person has their own color. One guy's lines are always orange, the next guy is green, etc. 
So going down the list organized by date, it would go "orange, green, red, orange, green,  red" and I'm able to see who's incentive I'm working on based on the color. It helps me pinpoint my focus so I don't get scatter-brained as easily. 
If you have any other questions just let me know!  Thanks!
