I've spent the last 4+ hours trying to paint my nails, and inevitably ruining them. I have gel polishes that *would* be dry immediately but no, my brain had decided it needed to be *this* color... finally giving up. Ughhhh Haha, ADHD Nail artist here. I made an account Just to answer this one.
First, clean your nails off and walk away for a bit.
Next, acquire a small desktop fan heater like this one: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Comfort-Zone-Ceramic-Electric-Portable-Space-Heater-Black-CZ442WM/21899614
and a bottle of Seche vite topcoat. They have it at sally beauty supply and I think ulta.
Paint your nails up with your super special color, top coat it with the Seche and sort of wag your fingers in front of the heater for a bit - don't burn yourself, it don't need to be THAT hot. The Seche sets up in about 6 minutes, give or take a few depending on how cold your house is and is fully hard in about 1/2 an hour. You should hear a tap on the painted surface, like clicking linoleum. Ugh traditional polish is Intolerable without a good fast dry topcoat.
Also, its a bit late - here at least, but try to be medicated when you paint. I find I do a MUCH better job when I am.

TDLR:
I Feels ya.Get a cheap desk heater and a good fast dry topcoat and life won't suck quite as much anymore. I have like 60 bottles of polish and I never do my own nails because I don't want to be restricted for the time it takes them to do and dry. ðŸ˜¢ I have all these techniques and stamping plates and I consistently get sheet prints or underwear markings on them before they're dry. Oh my gosh, thank you so much for such a detailed reply. 
I have a little heater like that at work, so I'll have to bring it home to try this!

Seriously, I'm so appreciative that you took the time. 
I was getting really frustrated and upset, so even if I don't do my nails tonight, it makes me feel a lot better that I potentially can.  Omg you're changing lives here. Especially since I use picking off nail polish as a fidget so I don't pick at my cuticles.  [I did it!](https://imgur.com/gallery/VQfMhZf) 

EDIT: Nevermind, Imgur made me feel bad about my attempt, so I deleted it :( Heh, seems I'm on a roll here. Yup, even doing it right I still sometimes end up with Unintentional Artistic Effects - or painting my steering wheel with my not quite dry nails. Good thing the cover is cheap...


Anyway, if you haven't, Try The Above. It really does help even a little. Also, if you do more complex polish art, like your mention of stamping plates suggests, you might try spacing the design out over a few sessions. Do the base color one session, topcoat, let dry, then do the stamping or sponging or whatever later. Heck, for some techniques like masking or vinyls, its the only Realistic way to do it. If your thing needs a tacky surface, just swipe some cheap clear over the dry nail. 

I've had to learn the hard way that more often than not, I Just Can't Sit Still/Pay Proper Attention  long enough to do the whole thing in one go - and do it Right.
I even do each hand at different times. I don't think I've worn the same color/design on both hands in over a year...
 Yay my obsession helped someone! Yeah, the heater should cut the dry time in half - it is paint after all. But don't underestimate the importance of a good top coat either. Apologies if you already know this, but SO MANY people don't. It will make it set up faster and toughens the paint so it doesn't nick as much - like the clearcoat on your car. I could NOT do nails without it. By the way, if you can't find Seche vit, essie Good to Go is a decent alternative and found in any drugstore, but if you got one you like, by all means use it. Happy painting:) Ugh cuticle pickers...yeah I know. I have a friend who does this, drives me nuts. The fidgit gets what the fidgit wants. I often catch myself worrying  my super long nails with my teeth. It don't really hurt them as long as they're painted AND I'm NOT Outright Chewing on them. 

For a USEFUL fidget, try a nail oil pen.

Buy them empty and fill with your fat of choice, or get them premade from some indie shop with good oil. It's good for your nails and skin in general AND gives you something to rub without tearing your fingers up.  That looks awesome!

Yeah the other problem is it's a vicious cycle...pick at all and then you have little pickable bits sticking up and then i pick at them and then it goes downhill until everything is infected  Before I got into nails, I used to have really bad hangnails and I would pull on then All The Time.
 
Weirdly enough- or not I suppose, painting and manicuring them and generally obsessing over All the Pretty Colors stopped the habit. My working theory is: 

If you're painting and fussing with your hands semi regularly, then you're probably moisturizing them as well.

If the skin is properly moisturized, there's no more hang nails to pull on. And if you are as deep into the rabbit hole as I was/am, you probably have a pair of these

 to clip off those tiny skin tags like a Real Life Salon Tech before your teeth can get to them. Yep, I'm a former nail biter as well.
