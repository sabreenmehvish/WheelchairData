Color coding while taking notes It just hit me that I use different colored pens when I'm taking notes and reading for class to keep myself engaged. Getting G to switch pens every few minutes satisfies the tangential thinking in my head and helps keep me focused! 

Anyone else ever suddenly realize that what you thought was just a habit or a quirk was actually a crafty coping strategy?? I did this in college! I highlighted key words with pink and the description or context with yellow.
