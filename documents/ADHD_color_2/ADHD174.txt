Hi /r/ADHD! If color coding has helped you, what is your system? Now that I have started pharmacy school I feel more disorganized and overwhelmed than ever! I am trying to get on track by using a planner and color coding it so I can easily see what I have going each week. I have read a few articles on on it, but they are not specific enough. I am having trouble coming up with which categories to use (e.g. tests, appointments, assignments...) and which colors I should use to signify each of my categories. 

In very specific details, what is your color-coding system? This sounds weird but I don't color code.     
When I do notes I use pens with a different thickness..... Like one paragraph is with a gel pen and the next is a fountain pen. They're all black though. Lol. It just works for me :I      
I don't think the colors matter though. Just don't use two similar colors next to eachother. I think if you have 3 subjects then do primary colors (red yellow blue) and if you have maybe 5 then add black and white.
