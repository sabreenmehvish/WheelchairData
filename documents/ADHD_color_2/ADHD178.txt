"Silly Mistakes" in Standardized Test Prep Hey, R/ADHD!

**TL;DR: Any tips for avoiding silly errors (dropping zeros, missing negatives, etc) on standardized tests?**

I'm currently prepping for the GRE, and I find myself having a lot of moments where I think: "Am I stupid?" This is, of course, a standard ADHD refrain, and we all know it isn't true, but when I keep dropping zeros and whatnot it's very discouraging.

I've prepped a lot, and my score if fine but could be a lot better if I didn't make so many damned silly errors! Does anybody have any tips for avoiding this sort of thing? I can keep myself on track and on task normally and have found systems to reign in my working memory, but this has me very frustrated.

Thanks a ton, pals ~~~ What about using one of those pens that can write in multiple colors then switching between colors each time you write a zero?  
  
Also, you could color code your equations.  
  
I'm a software engineer and a color coded IDE to view code is always easier than plain ol' notepad.  
  
Just an idea based upon my experiences.
