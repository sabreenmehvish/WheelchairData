Stuck on a thought and repeating it until it's perfect? Every now and then I'll get I'll get too "interested" in a thought and keep going back to it in loops until I've thought about every possible detail around that thought. For example if someone says "cat", I can't just think of a cat. I have to envision the cat's hair color, the cat's name, where it lives and how it's life is like. Until it seems just right. I know it sounds silly and I've tried to stop doing this but my mind will not let me move on from the thought because if I do I might "forget" something or look over something important. All of this is accompanied by high anxiety. Whenever this happens I have to pause and focus on it intensely so I can't do anything but look at the ground and my palms get sweaty from the anxiety. Many episodes have lasted up to 30 minutes of me just looking at the ground straight thinking of every single detail about something because I'm worried I'll look over something important. I haven't always had this - it started happening in the last few months and I have been pretty stressed in these few months as well which I think adds on to it. What is this and how do I fix it? have you been diagnosed with anything? You have somehow just put into words how I have to visualize anything. I'm unsure if it's related directly to ADHD but I have found it seems to be a trend.
