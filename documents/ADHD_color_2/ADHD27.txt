On Meds vs Off Meds [Humor] On Meds: Alright, I have to work on these reports for an hour, then take a 15min break, then have a meeting after...

Off Meds: [runs around the apartment singing the chorus to “Let’s Go Fly a Kite” repeatedly while playing with the cat]

On Meds: This balanced breakfast of cereal and milk, OJ, yogurt, and maybe a banana. Then my morning tea...

Off Meds: I guess since I missed breakfast I’ll have... four Eggos and a PB&J sandwich!  It's more fun to be off. At least until you realize that life has quickly spun out of control. on meds: how beautiful is it that i just finished this essay three days before the deadline?

off meds: my cat is so cute. also i just missed an entire week worth of due dates Off meds: stuck laying in bed, no motivation to move, ordering seamless and having laundry delivered. 

On meds: I'm going to take my laundry to the laundromat, hit Whole Foods while it's washing, put it in the dryer, sprint 3 miles at the gym, take it home and put it away, write out my schedule for the week, write out my entire life plan, text everyone I've ever met telling them how much they mean to me, research tricks to raising the best dog ever, research best dogs ever, research exotic pets, research home captivity v. zoo captivity, research bed zoos, research flights to cities with best zoos, plan a day trip to the Bronx zoo, plan a day trip to explore the Bronx, scratch my cuticles for 30 minutes, wonder what my purpose on earth is, draw a diagram to designate my purpose on earth, color code said diagram, color code my schedule, color code my notes, continue to do meaningless tasks with instant gratification rather than important long term things I need to accomplish.  Haha - for me the breakfast one is actually almost the opposite:  
  
On Meds: I have 0 appetite and I'm really busy right now, I'll just get lunch later.   

Off Meds: I guess I'll eat a chocolate bar and maybe a croissant and oo I have leftover pizza in the fridge! On meds: I have to go now, I'm supposed to be somewhere in half an hour.

Off meds: I better get ready soon, I was supposed to be there two hours ago.  I take small breaks sometimes, I don't feel my medication and it's seeing the difference that makes me realize they're still working (easy to get used to being more productive).

It's amazing how not doing small things (dishes in the kitchen, clothes in hamper etc) can add up to complete chaos in a few days. 

Also for singing and playing with the cat, if you replace all the words with 'meow' you're kinda serenading him/her! On meds: shit- guess it's time to put out all those fires that I accidentally started. Let's pay for those past due parking tickets, research the best schools for my kid, pay the bills, send those thank you cards, plan my kids bday party in one day before i forget about it for a another month or two, etc, etc, etc...

Off meds- "hey I've got a great idea!!! Let's go to Europe!!! TOMORROW!!!!!" hopped on plane with sister and had an epic time.

On Meds- hmm I think I should budget and start saving 

Off- it seems as though I've got an endless supply of cash! Time to blow that shit as fast as possible!  Off meds: Let's see how fast I can reverse on a snowy dirt road!

https://imgur.com/a/Xph4x Yeah, it's actually scary how much of a wreck my life was without uppers.  It's sort of sad, but at least I know now... This. So fun to take days off the meds. You won't get shit done but atleast now you know everything about the opium trade and the life of Carl Sagan. What due dates?! Oh yes... I vaguely remember those. Whoopsies!! "I'm late again, better pick up a sandwich or a later"

Later: Hamburger, fries, chocolate, large soda  I had Tostitos lime chips for breakfast. And a spoonful of frosting.  "I'm late again, better pick up a sandwich or a later"

I can't remember any lyrics so that's pretty much what I do! Or I make up my own lyrics and turn it into a song about cats.  ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

Guess who's house looks like a tornado hit it now?! Haha, Sounds like my weekend. 
Guess who just spent his first hour on meds cleaning the entire house. Oh nice! I spent my washing my kids coat and rushing it to her school (2 hrs after I  dropped her off) because I forgot to dry it last night. Left it in the washer overnight and had to rewash bc of the weird smell. Oops.
