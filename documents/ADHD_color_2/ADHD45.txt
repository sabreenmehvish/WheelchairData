OrgIdeas Planners with minimal graphics and colors I struggled to use planners for years. It dawn on me that i found them too busy that using them long term was unpleasant. Went in search of some found two. Mind you these are undated because I needed something to start with in October. Plus, i found the dates too restrictive. I've been using the action agenda(see below) it's almost a been a year and I've used 90% of it. Some weeks i didn't feel like it. &nbsp;

* **Poketo** Daily weekly Monthly planner https://www.poketo.com/collections/planners/products/daily-weekly-monthly-planner-in-grid   (the times are in 24hr format/in light red)
* **Action Agenda** Minimalist Undated Medium Day Planner (in greyscale)http://store.actionagendas.com/Minimalist-Undated-Medium-Day-Planner-7-x-85-inches_p_136.html I really enjoyed [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) because it is a systematic, easy way to use a plain journal as a complete planner. Some people decorate the heck out of it, but you don't have to (I sure don't).
