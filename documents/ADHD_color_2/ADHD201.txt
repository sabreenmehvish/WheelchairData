little comfort in being just by myself i feel like i always need to be talking or doing something with someone else. whenever i do something completely by myself (such as playing games or watching a movie) it just doesn't feel as interesting as it should be. it feels like something is missing. 

this is not to say that i don't get tired of people though. i often need to wind down after being with someone in real life. something about it is just exhausting (possibly hiding my true colors because adhd makes me feel as if if i were to truly express myself i'd scare people off with my ability to speak nine thousand words per minute and a whole myriad of the symptoms it comes with).

nonetheless though i find that a lot of the things i do (outside of hyperfocus) is dependent on others being present which leads to me developing and staying with people that may not necessarily be healthy for me. maybe i need to just make new friends who are as loyal as i am? either way, i hope someone else has any advice on how i could tame or treat this issue.

tl;dr: are there any good methods as to how i can stop being dependent on others for me to actually enjoy doing trivial things?â€‹
