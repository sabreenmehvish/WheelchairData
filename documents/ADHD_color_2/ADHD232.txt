Another app just jumped out at me as potentially helpful for Android ADHDers with problems matching names with faces  Installed this, and tested it. The extent of it is as follows:

Name, 

Category (General or specific: Bars, Church, Classmate, Work, etc.;can create your own, as well), 

About,

Once you add them, you can click on them and create an icon/avatar for them (no function for adding an actual picture): Skin Color, Hair color, Hairstyle, Beard, Shirt color, Shirt (type), glasses.

IMO...it looks like this app does **less** than your stock Android 'Contacts' program already does. Not worth it. I looked at the description, but haven't installed yet. What advantage does this have over the stock contacts app? I use 'organization' field to describe a person, or at least how I know them, and take a picture of them to go with it. 

Basically, what does this app do in addition to that, and how does it help me not pull out my phone to ID someone? Or am I missing the point here? Wow!  This looks incredibly useful.  Murdock92188, I don't think its meant to be a replacement for Contacts; I think its a tool to create "notes" about someone's name, and put some graphics with it.  

I'll have to download this and play with it and see if it works for me. There's also [Evernote Hello](http://evernote.com/hello/) which looks like it might be similar. I think the only benefit is the ability to quickly sketch an avatar when it's not feasible to take a picture, and you don't know the person enough to include a stand-out fact about them. I would use this when trying to learn the names of a lot of new people at once, like in a new class.
