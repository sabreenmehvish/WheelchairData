Looking for help to build my best friend (dog) a wheelchair that is recently paralyzed My best friend, an 11 year old dachshund, recently lost function of his back legs due to IVDD. Surgery isn‚Äôt an option due to another medical condition.  He‚Äôs still spunky and wants to move and I will not give up on him. I want to give him independence and movement again. 

I‚Äôm looking to connect with an engineer who can design and build a custom wheelchair for him so he‚Äôs more comfortable than just buying a generic one online. I‚Äôm willing to pay, this isn‚Äôt a charity situation. Please PM me. [they are easily purchasable ](https://www.handicappedpets.com/adjustable-dog-wheelchairs/)

[DIY](http://dogsaholic.com/care/how-to-make-a-dog-wheelchair.html)  Good for you, man. üëç‚ù§Ô∏è Eddie's Wheel, one of the links below, is in Shelburne Falls, MA. That is a doable roadtrip to have it custom fitted. https://www.handicappedpets.com/

They're in Amherst, NH. Thanks, I‚Äôm aware you can buy them online. I got a second hand one that was purchased online and not convinced a one size fits xx is comfortable. Well. There is 6 other options for you  Thank you.
