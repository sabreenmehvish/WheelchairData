Woman in wheelchair smokes "blunt" on subway, thrown off train  Im not going to lie, i might do the same . Jobs dont care if you were putting the stuff to your lips or if you were hotboxing.  Holy shit I was thinking someone just wheeled her out -- looks like they actually THREW her off. I see this woman on 32nd street...  she camps out sometimes on the uptown 6th Avenue platform (under the stairs, by the JC Pennies exit.

She goes into R Cafe and picks through the food.

She smokes up on the subway platform.

It's sad.
 One of my coworkers was just telling me about this lady! Apparently the other day she shit on the platform, used her hand to wipe and then picked up the shit and threw it onto the tracks.  Good. Keep that dirty junkie bum on the streets, maybe the freeze will rid society of it.  we used to call those "[fatties](http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/12935158_357496854374689_681584149_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTIzNjUzMDA4NzU1NDcxMjU1MQ%3D%3D.2)."
