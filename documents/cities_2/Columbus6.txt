Looking for an affordable place to live in Columbus/Westerville area. Must have wheelchair accessibility. Preferably with a roll-in shower as well. I've been in contact with Creative Living. They offer only a temporary solution. Suggestions? Check out any of the properties like Alexander square or whoever those are owned by. I have a friend in a wheelchair and they are really nice and accessible.
