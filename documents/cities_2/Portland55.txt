Does anyone have a spare wheelchair? hey Portland reddit, one of my coworkers broke his neck in a climbing accident and he needs a wheelchair for the next three months. I am a skilled painter and would gladly exchange my time so that my coworker could have a wheelchair. If there is a spare wheelchair around please respond to this post! Thank you! Wow - that really sucks.  I hope they're ok and you're quite the guy to volunteer your time/effort.

However.

Obamacare.  Medicare.  Assistance programs galore.  Please contact government services.  You should be able to get one.  That's what obamacare is for and fixes - these situations where people have to beg for medical coverage. I have one but it needs repair. only one of the side brakes works, and one armrest doesn't have a plastic cover, and there are no 'leg/foot' holders, but you can have it for free if you want.
