Paraplegic veteran from Fishers surprises bride with wheelchair-free dance  He hurt himself riding a motorcycle after coming back... Calling him a "paraplegic veteran" makes it sound like he hurt himself while serving... 

As far as I can tell him serving in the military has literally nothing to do with this story except that calling him a veteran gets more web traffic on Veterans Day...  The story does indicate that he rode motorcycles to help him cope with PTSD. Sure it does. It'd sort of have to to keep the veteran angle relevant. [deleted]
