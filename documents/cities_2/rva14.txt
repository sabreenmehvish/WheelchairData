Science Museum of Virginia - Hack Those Prices Hi all! I work at the Science Museum of Virginia\*. A while back, I put together some resources out there for people who may want to visit but can't afford tickets and posted it on FB, but realized some of y'all may find it useful as well.

The Museum normally charges adults (age 13-59) $15.00, seniors and children 6-12 $13.50, and young children (3-5) $10 for admission, with $4 extra for the films/planetarium shows. As it's gone under extensive renovations recently (with the final stage of the updates, a maker-space called "The Forge," opening up in the fall), this place has a lot of great exhibits for science fans and children-at-heart. But it is also pricey.

Our **free** community festival "Preparathon" is on Saturday August 25th. Admission to exhibits and festival exhibits is free, films/planetarium shows are $5, and our "Body Worlds: Animal Inside Out" special exhibit is $7.50 (this is the cheapest they've offered AIO for all summer, and it leaves after Labor Day).

If you have an **EBT card**, adult tickets are $2, children and seniors are $1, and a film, planetarium show, or special exhibit is $1 extra. All you need to do is present your EBT card to the Front Desk. You can also purchase a yearlong membership for $20 when you present your EBT card - this will cover 2 adults and any children under 18 in the household for a year of visits! For families/households with more than two adults, this just means that when you go and present your membership card, any two adults will be admitted under the membership. Additional adult(s) could then present an EBT card and just pay the $2 ticket price. More information here: [http://www.smv.org/…/me…/PDFs/Exploreyourworld%202018.04.pdf](http://www.smv.org/storage/app/media/PDFs/Exploreyourworld%202018.04.pdf)

If you have a **teacher's ID**, **active military ID**, or an **unlimited GRTC pass**, you get free admission to the exhibits. If you are a **state employee**, you can buy a 26% off family membership (until September 3) when you present your ID.

If you have **teens**/know teens who would like to be a part of a "Maker-space," they can get a FREE membership with parent/guardian permission! For the rest of the summer, the MiX is open M-F, and during the school year it's F-Sun. More information here: [http://www.smv.org/learn/the-mix](http://www.smv.org/learn/the-mix)

For anyone with a **student ID** \- the Museum's monthly "Science After Dark" event is free with your ID and includes admission to all exhibits, special activities, and one planetarium show. This month's event is August 17th.

Regarding **accessibility** \- the Museum has manual and electric wheelchairs and other mobility devices you can borrow. The entire museum is accessible by elevators. If you go to the movie, we can let you in at the theater exit so you don’t have to deal with stairs - just let us know when you purchase your tickets. If you are Deaf/HoH, non-astronomy movies have captions and we can set up a personal caption device, but you do have to sit in a specific section of the theater and thus we cannot accommodate wheelchair users for captioning devices at this time. Unfortunately, we do not have captioning set up for astronomy shows right now.

\*This isn't an advertisement, to clarify - I work in the planetarium. I used to sell tickets at the front desk, and finding people discounts so they could afford to enjoy themselves was my *favorite* part of that position. I grew up coming here until my family couldn't afford the membership, and now I'm really passionate about increasing access to STEM and informal learning opportunities.

(Edited to reflect summer/school year schedule for the MiX.) (Edited again for minor language changes.) Additional resource: if you sign up for Recycling Perks (reward-based recycling program), you can redeem your accumulated points for a buy one get one free ticket! My whole family came to visit and I got 6 tickets for the price of three. It’s completely free and automatic. Just have to register your home’s recycling bin online! "If you have teens/know teens who would like to be a part of a "Maker-space," they can get a FREE membership with parent/guardian permission, **and spend their weekends** in The MiX! More information here: [http://www.smv.org/learn/the-mix](http://www.smv.org/learn/the-mix)"

Is The Mix open on weekends?  It looks like Mon-Fri 12-5pm. Is SMV membership or ticket purchase required?  Thanks for the info.   A little bit of a spin-off, but if you have a membership to the SMV you can use it for free admission to many other museums with the ASTC Travel Passport Program.  We did this on a visit to Philly for free admissin to Natural Sciences at Drexel and the Franklin Institute.   Pay attention to the 90-mile rule. [http://www.astc.org/passport/](http://www.astc.org/passport/) Former employee here, you might consider adding field trip grant info here as well. I know lots of educators are on here and would probably find the discounted admissions for area schools useful.  So for teachers admission is free all year long?  Upvote for the MiX. My teen brother spends all day there and he loves it. Definitely better than him being at home gaming all the time. Thank you for letting me know about the wheelchairs and mobility scooters! There’s a display at the museum I’ve been wanting to see so this is great. 

Edit: autocorrect strikes again Great resource! Thanks for posting. Thanks, just got an email about this from Britt Thurman at my work! Very helpful, especially for EBT people.  IMO, The museum is way too expensive for being really overly physics heavy and super under representing areas like chemistry, geology, biology, medicine.  I know it's unlikely, but do VCU Health employees get any discounts? I've been meaning to go, and I'd buy the tickets full price anyway. What's good to see at the museum? The last time I went was about three years ago with some young teenage family members from out of town. As I remember it, there was a model train car and a twenty year old CP30 cut out talking about what would happen when the Mars rover mission launched(!). They were severely unimpressed. I know the Blackbird is there now. Has the museum been updated in other ways since then? Question, if you are a TA for a graduate program does that count as being either a teacher or state employee? >Recycling Perks

Cool beans.  Thanks Oops - I wrote the original post in the spring and missed that detail. During the school year, the MiX is open Friday/Saturday/Sunday, but during the summer it's on a M-F schedule. Technically, the MiX membership is only for the MiX, but they'll go explore the galleries sometimes in groups. So you don't need a family membership or ticket. Yeah! It got us (family of four) into the Denver Science Museum in June - saved us a little over $60, and we all had a blast! That's cool!  I'm a member and didn't realize that! I know of at least one family that did a cross-country road trip specifically to use the ASTC reciprocal membership. They saved thousands of dollars! I actually don't have access to updated information on field trip grant assistance. I think that's a question for info \[at\] smv \[dot\] org! >So for teachers admission is free all year long?

Last I checked! Yes, free all year except for the paid exhibits like Body Works.  Same applies to VMFA Happy to hear he likes.  Dropping my son & his friend off for the first time this week.  I couldn't disagree more.  The second floor is dedicated to Anatomy & Physiology, life science/biology, and more.  Also, rotating exhibitions and demonstrations do their best to round out the science (see BodyWorks now).


Keep in mind that the SMV is an attraction, not a comprehensive science education.  The audience is intended to be diverse, and needs to be interesting to kids and adults with varying levels of education.  I can't speak for other people, but I have no interest in a permanent exhibit on Avagadro's number (6.02*10^23, thanks Mrs. Stowe).  Sure, chemistry demonstrations can be fun/ cool but there's a liability and a cost involved that would be prohibitive for a permanent exhibit.   I get it. Our focus is making science seem accessible to Virginians, so we try to create interactive exhibits that are engineering, health, climate, animal, and physics focused. There is a room dedicated to the geology of Virginia, although it's pretty old. Unfortunately we just don't have the funds and staffing to cover every topic. Trust me, I wish we could! 

If you've ever got a Wednesday hour free, we have Lunch Break Science at noon every week - an hour-long, free lecture series by different guest speakers, often focusing on topics we don't cover in our exhibits! I'm wondering the same thing. Also does the VCU employee/student free GRTC rides qualify for the unlimited pass discount?  The blackbird is hanging in the main floor (someone needs to tell me the story how they got it in there) lots of interactive stuff that all ages would love, including a air hockey playing robot. Nature exhibits with a operating beehive, a cool collection of smaller critters and the revamped area in the basement for little kiddos was a huge win for us. All the major parts of the museum have been renovated in the last few years! The Speed gallery, as others have said, features the SR-71 Blackbird, as well as lots of interactive exhibits that are focused on physics and tech. About three times a day there is a free Science on a Sphere show in the back of that gallery - those are really awesome and feature some of our best educators! Downstairs, there's Boost!, which focuses on your body and mind - there's some good interactive bits that cover health/biology/psychology. On the second floor there are labs with live beehives, snakes/frogs/etc., and art activities. We also have rats that play basketball twice a day! 

And of course, I'm biased, but I would especially recommend an astronomy show - if you come up to the presenter at the top and ask nicely, we can normally accommodate special requests during the live portion of the show! Phantom of the Universe (about dark matter) and Planet Nine (about our solar system) cover more advanced topics so I'd recommend those for older teens/adults. Do you have a state employee ID? Or do you have an instructor ID?  Great, thanks for the response.  I'll have to keep an eye for this next year. I see attendance is capped at 25, does it often fill-up?  If someone is there by noon, is there a line to get in?  Does a parent need to be there to sign them in & out each session once they are signed up for the program? What happens if you are a teacher at a private school, that doesn't issue IDs to their teachers? Chiming in about VMFA-- general admission to VMFA is free for everyone (not just teachers), and they usually offer free admission to special exhibitions for all state employees and teachers. I tend to agree more with OP on the pricing. It's a museum for kids and it doesn't really have a huge amount of replay value to me. I dislike when museums for children have such high prices for adults, too. It hasn’t been A&P for a while, at least 1.5 years at this point - that’s where the “forge” is going.  I agree it isn’t a text book but between speed, the forge, the MiX, and the new davinci thing there’s a lot lot lot less of your icky-sticky sciences. I’m not hating on the museum but it isn’t at all well rounded at this time.  Not sure about VCU employees - I think it's only for students or professors. As far as the GRTC, I believe it's with your bus pass. [http://ridegrtc.com/fares/find-rewards/P20](http://ridegrtc.com/fares/find-rewards/P20) When VCU rolls out the separate bus passes then maybe, but I've been just showing my student ID to the drivers so I don't think that would work.  It was taken apart for cleaning/restoration, they knocked down some back walls of the museum for construction anyway and brought it in pieces. 

[Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8LAOwr8sa0) No instructor ID, but I get paid through VCU which is a state agency.  Hey! I’m one of the mentors in the MiX. So far, we have’t turned any MiX member away. The teens tend to self regulate and will work/play outside or explore the museum itself. 

Parents do not need to be there to sign them in, the teen signs into the museum and then into the MiX, but they are free to come and go as they please. I'm not sure about the logistics of the cap - check with mbaker \[at\] smv \[dot\] org. MiX members get a membership card that they present to the Front Desk to scan (if they forget/lose it, a staff person can look them up by their name). Some parents accompany their children to check in, others simply drop them at the front.  Give them a call - they can tell you what kind of identification they'll accept! Also, I'm happy to agree with u/hlangel that the exhibits could be updated and more diverse (keeping in mind the scale and affordability), but in the last 5ish years they added the entire SPEED section (with an actual SR71 frame hanging from the ceiling), revamped the kids section, and are apparently replacing the oldest exhibit (A&P) with a maker-space.... so I'm willing to cut 'em some slack, because they're clearly working hard to improve.   If you're paying per entry, it can be costly, but from August 1 - September 3, Virginia state employees can purchase a Family membership for $99.  That money goes to support better exhibits and science education, so I don't have a problem paying it... even if we only go 2-3x year. Oh cool!  The A&P stuff was one of the oldest permanent exhibits.  

Out of curiosity, what medical, biology, geology, and chemistry exhibits would you want to see? That is awesome!!! Thanks! I definitely didn’t think they had to shove it in in one piece... -shifts eyes nervously- That's nuts! Thanks for sharing Thanks so much for the reply.  My son & his friend will be coming on Wed.  They are looking forward to it! Thanks.  We may try and squeeze in one visit this summer. 5ish years is a long timeframe for those improvements.  I don't know what the specific problems at the institution are, but the pricing structure and lack of ROI on a per visit basis are a red flag for me.  At $15/$10 per patron they shouldn't be asking patrons to finance future improvements, especially on that timeline.  Are they struggling with charitable contributions?  Corporate sponsorships?  Have they spent past contributions to their endowment wisely?  Have there been too many changes in leadership, or maybe not enough changes?  I haven't been paying attention but I jave been to other science museums and childrens museums across the country recently and the others don't seem to have the same problems. If I went 3 times a year (which is a stretch, because I don't really think it has the replay value for that) that would still be $33 per visit - which is too much. If you go to the NYC museum of natural history they have a whole hallway on the evolution of HIV to be able to infect humans. Something like that - topical, educational on the current issues. Perhaps antibiotic resistance, maybe epidemiology. 

More on the concepts of earthquakes, tectonic movement and subluxation and all that Jazz would be cool for geology. Or things like erosion ( a la formulation of the Grand Canyon) 

These kinds of topical things that are educational but capture attention by being accessible would be awesome. That’s how you get hooked on science like I did as a kid.  I'm not sure if you're just trolling, but I don't have the energy to continue this discussion.  You're welcome to hate on a state-governed museum all you like. I think it's an asset, and will continue to support it in the hopes that they continue to grow & diversify.  

What I view as improvements and progress (2 major structural additions & a renovation) in the last 5ish years, you view as an indicator of problems.  If you want to dig deeper, [here is their annual report](http://i.icpro.co/Files/460/2EC86D/14BE2/8b7bac3755354731948badfb5bc93472/0/Annual+Report+2017sm.pdf) #PDFwarnning

A few years ago (7ish?), I complained about one of the travelling exhibits that came into the museum.  I've been happy with everything that's followed.  It's not the Natural History Museum in NYC, or the Smithsonian... but it's an entry point for science education here in our little city, and I hope it grows and improves to be one of those nationally recognized institutions.  Until then, they can have my $100/year and I'll try to outrun a crocodile, and throw a baseball over 60mph, and see an imax movie from time to time.   For 2 adults and 2 kids?  I disagree.  You can't eat out with those same people for less than $33.   I mean, the American Museum of Natural History is literally one of the best in the country with Net Assets over $1.4 BILLION dollars.  Their Operating expenditures are $400M ($275M of which are Bonds/loans), and the space is 333,500 square feet.

As a point of comparison, the SMV's Net Assets are $24M, wiht expenses of 6.7M.  Even after the additions this year (+24,000 sq ft), the museum is only 240,000 sq ft.   

I mean, yes, your suggestions could add diversity into their exhibits, but let's not compare apples to oranges when we talk about scale.  I mean, you picked one of the jewels of the museum world. :) Eating out provides more entertainment than going to see the same exhibits 3 times. I just find the place very uninteresting. It's for the kids, so there's really no reason why I should be paying those prices for an adult. Haha, I did an internship last summer at AMNH and I was so incredibly jealous of every square inch of that beautiful place. But we are at *very* different scales...although a girl can dream about the day we get that kind of funding! No no I wasn’t comparing I was saying they should use it as a gold standard model! I adore the NYC natural history but I’m not unrealistic
