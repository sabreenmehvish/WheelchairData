Thursday: How Secure Are Elections in Colorado? How is Colorado's election system keeping up with new technology and threats from foreign hackers? Learn more this Thursday from 5-7 at the Irish Snug (downstairs). We'll have folks from the Colorado Secretary of State's Office on hand to talk through this topic and answer questions. 

This event is free and open to everyone - light refreshments will be served and drinks are available for purchase. The Irish Snug is wheelchair accessible. [More info & RSVP here](https://actionnetwork.org/events/how-secure-are-elections-in-colorado/). Hope to see a few fellow Redditors there.  I can't make this one but would be interested in future Common Cause events in Denver. Is there a mailing list sort of thing? I couldn't find something like that on your web site. [This is what you can expect to hear.](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/12/colorado-election-security-report-ranking/)  (Sorry paywall from *&$#@% DP)


tl;dr About the best in the country.  The mail in process helps a lot. Not perfect but not bad. 
 Enjoy the beer, take whatever you hear with healthy skepticism. [This was just in the news.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hackers-break-into-voting-machines-defcon-las-vegas/) We do! If you go to [our website](https://www.commoncause.org/colorado/), the landing page will say "Help us fight for a government that represents all of us" - just enter your email / zip code and you'll be added to the list :)  If you attended the event, you would learn that unlike other states, Colorado does not store voting information on voting machines. Every voter ultimately casts a paper ballot - meaning that there is a paper trail for every election. 

Colorado voting machines are only **ballot marking devices** \- meaning that the voter uses the machine to make their selection, and then the device spits out a paper ballot that shows how they voted. The voter then checks this paper ballot for errors. So, a "hacked" voting machine would be detected pretty quickly, as folks would say "hey I voted for candidate A and the voting machine marked candidate B, what's up?" This news would travel from the voter > election judge > county clerk pretty fast. 

And since we're on the topic (and I like to nerd out on election admin) here are a few quick facts: 

* Colorado voting machines are not hooked up to WiFi (this is how the hackers broke into the machines in this article)
* Colorado performs post-election audits (we're the first state to do this, actually) 
* Colorado requires all voting machines be tested to [EAC Voluntary Voting System Guidelines](https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines/) prior to being purchased and used in the state
* Colorado requires election officials to carry out pre-election logic and accuracy testing on all machines that will be used in an upcoming election 

Let me know if you have additional questions / concerns about voting in Colorado and I'll be happy to assist.  I never thought about it but that makes total sense about the paper ballots.  Thanks! Thanks for the information. How does this scale for every voter in Colorado? For example, I vote by mail and have no way to check that what I filled out is what the machine reports. What percentage of registered voters in CO vote by mail? > How does this scale for every voter in Colorado? For example, I vote by mail and have no way to check that what I filled out is what the machine reports.  

This is a long answer, and one that will certainly be explained in-depth tomorrow evening. Since you seem to be pretty interested in this topic, maybe you should come? ;) 

> What percentage of registered voters in CO vote by mail? 

The vast majority of Coloradans vote using the ballot they received in the mail (either by putting a stamp on it and mailing it back, or depositing it at a drop box or Voter Service & Polling Center). In the 2016 election, [93% of voters opted to vote their mail ballot](http://www.denverpost.com/2016/11/20/turnout-flat-colorado-election-2016-mail-ballot-laws/) \- while 7% chose to vote in person.   the main point you are replying to is about the security of the ballot marking devices themselves, which is not relevant to mail in ballots; however both types of ballots are then counted by machines, and the accuracy of that count is ensured by several checks and balances

at the point of counting the votes, no ballot can be traced back to the voter so no voter can verify directly how their particular ballot was counted; instead there are various methods of ensuring that ballots are not tampered with and that the machines scan accurately; [auditors then spot check some ballots by hand](https://bartels-on.sos.state.co.us/index.php/2018/07/09/another-election-another-risk-limiting-audit-for-colorados-county-clerks/), and because all the ballots are human-readable, if there were sufficient doubt about the machinesâ€™ accuracy, every ballot could be recounted by hand
