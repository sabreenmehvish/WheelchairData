/R/PORTLAND THANKSGIVING V - GAME ON! **Edit:** In full swing, come join us!

It's on!  Join everyone for the 5th annual /r/portland Thanksgiving.  All are welcome!
*(...Yes, that includes you introverts, we have games!)*

Despite galactic forces arraying against, the tradition continues for the 5th year - /u/coolhandmarie generously rented an amazing spot on Division, so we have a location.

**What:**  /r/Portland 5th Annual Thanksgiving Potluck

**Where:**  3384 SE Division St

**When:**  3pm - 9pm (possibly later...)

**[RSVP here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZQ5kB_9tyW3GTSmn39c22hm8Oj88XOkjlE1GfTEsAeVlKVA/viewform?usp=send_form)**


In case you're not familiar, this tradition started 5 years ago with about 25 of us.  Last year, we have 250+ people through over the course of the day - and it's a diverse crowd of younger and older folks, individuals and families.  Despite it being ostensibly a Reddit gathering, we've even had females and employed people come *every single year!*

**Note that if you can bring a turkey, we will all worship you forever!**  Please let us know - [and please RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oR0BjInbUGUvp_-nAbl5TPL2JB3-v3SNW_4SX2Ah5Lw/edit) if you  think there's even a fair chance you'll make it.  **Please note that there is no oven access,** but there is an industrial sink and electricity. If you can bring a microwave, please note it in the RSVP as well.

Finally, /u/coolhandmarie blew my mind by renting a place to make sure this could happen.  If you have the means, I'm asking folks to see if we can cover her costs -  I've set up a GoFundMe for anyone willing and able to contribute back! ^...it ^was ^^over ^^^$900! **EDIT**:  No GoFundMe links allowed... asking mods, but removed for now.  PM me and I can send a link!

Look forward to seeing you there, and drop questions in the comments!

Hey guys, here are a few [photos](http://m.imgur.com/a/jP65F) from later in the evening (I wish i took more, if you have some, please share!) Also, I can't believe you guys covered almost the entire rental cost. After posting the cash donations from last night (170!) onto the gofundme, I am basically covered. That's incredible. I hope everyone had as much fun as I did. [deleted] Hey /u/Purple_Antwerp and /u/coolhandmarie!  Thanks for hosting this again.  When I came, I was recently divorced and  had nobody to celebrate with.  You all welcomed me and made my holiday a nice experience.  Hope you have some turkeys this year.  ;)  Can't make it, but I hope you all enjoy! For anyone able to kick in on the rental, we appreciate it!  There is a Go Fund Me set up at gofundme at /rportland-thanksgiving-5 (no direct links allowed, hence posting goofy address)  I want to extend my complete gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the gofundme to help me recoup the money I spent for the rental. You are wonderful people, and I feel SO thrilled that you believe in and enjoy this tradition enough to help cover my costs. I am excited to see you and thank you in person later today. **Whomever anonymously donated $450, literally half the entire amount I spent on the rental, THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. Your generosity blew my mind.** I have two microwaves and a toaster oven you can have if you want.  No need to return them (don't worry; they are in great shape).  Just let me know if there is somewhere I can drop them off today (on the east side). I might try to drop off alcohol. Is that cool? Do I need to rsvp for that? I already have a couple events I have to attend so I wouldn't be able to stay [deleted] [deleted] As someone from out of the country, I'm wondering: is this on wednesday (thanksgiving-evening?) or on thursday (thanksgiving day)? I live right up the street and don't have family here!! Please, everyone, if you can spare a couple bucks, help pay for this.  I'm so terribly pleased that this has become a tradition, and I want to see it succeed and continue. Marie is the coolest.  https://imgur.com/Q1cl2yt Can anyone please confirm if we do or do not have a bird?
I would like to provide one large or two small, cooked.  I do not want to through this massive effort if someone has already decided to provide a bird.

/u/coolhandmarie and /u/Purple_Antwerp pls respawn Is there a freezer (for ice cream)? Who needs a ride? Thank you to everyone who came out and celebrated with us! Thanks /u/coolhandmarie and /u/Purple_Antwerp for hosting a great Thanksgiving feast!
Best of: Nic's turkey, hot scalloped potato casserole, hot sweet potato casserole - pureed and topped with the perfect amount of brown sugar & nuts in every bite. Shout out to the Burner art-install-maker guy and Nic and Marlene - thanks for your company.
Had a really good time :)
-Emma I tried [mapping](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3384+se+division+portland/@45.5048237,-122.6299074,3a,75y,150.2h,80.11t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5Tgw5oJ5y3wsVRBncuVGTw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5af76453309c1cf4!6m1!1e1) this and got a taco place. Any talk of carpooling? It is newsworthy to those in the foodie community that you were able to rent that space, I imagine.  Either way, it looks like a total blast! Will try to stop by with zedruu I'm going solo and anxious!  Also the host,  so imagine how exhausted I'll be! [deleted] I probably will, I went last year and it was a pretty great time even though I ride the same boat. (: I'm probably going, and if I do it will definitely be solo. That's what the beer is for! I went alone one year and it was awesome! I'm going solo, so you won't be the only one  This will be my fifth one.  And I'll be solo yet again. I came solo and am having a blast!  Played a social card game with a group and it really helped with anxiety.  Everyone is really nice! Guys, this is the man who slaved away and brought not one, but TWO cooked turkeys to the event! Hope you have social bonds keeping you away!  Also, bring em, Turkey Hero! Embarrassing that the mods won't allow you to link the GFM page for such a good cause.

Embarrassing... but not at all surprising. This is so generous, man. I live on the west side , but I will come to you if no one on the east side volunteers a drop off location! Hey it's me ur party. We will put it to good use, you can count on us!  Thanks!  No need to RSVP. I see were your priorities lie. I'm guessing not being high isn't an option? I am thinking about going despite being terrified of strangers and normally preferring to avoid all human contact There will probably be lots of ents. Thank you for donating, sincerely. It was worth spending the 900 bucks to me just to have such a nice event together, but people like you throwing a little bit back to me make me feel heartwarmed, and like people really do value the annual efforts to accomodate an increasingly large group without abandoning our mantra of "open to ALL".

Edit: plus I am going to Costco later today and am going to be able to buy us all some extra appetizers and treats now, since the rental cost was all of my funds :) That would be HEROIC.  Maybe Freddies? As a previous turkey-bringer, I bought two fresh turkeys for about $50 at Freddies, cooked them at home and brought them.  Wasn't the easiest, but I did it! Thursday, Thanksgiving day! Respectable families only, sorry :P

See ya there! Respectable families only, sorry :P

See ya there! Respectable families only, sorry :P

See ya there! Sorry for the respawn timer.   But we always need more bird, and you can join the ranks of the Turkey Heros of yore! [deleted] Thanks to you [/u/coolhandmarie](https://www.reddit.com/u/coolhandmarie) and [/u/Purple_Antwerp](https://www.reddit.com/user/Purple_Antwerp) for hosting another great Thanksgiving. Do we know how many stopped by on one of the wetter Thanksgivings I can remember? The business is no longer operating, and that is the correct location :) Depends, where are you located?  I'll  be coming from Milwaukie, and can transport up to five, as long as someone is willing to hold a crockpot in their lap. You're **very** right, but I am trying to keep the name of the space on the DL, since they were so gracious to allow us to go break bread onsite during their hiatus...but I sincerely have been floored by their hospitality for this event.


 Obviously Google will tell people the name, but the main point I see is more like "local business bothers having owners come in on both ends of the day on *Thanksgiving* to allow cute community tradition to continue" 
 I have been experimenting a ton lately with a mono red Feldon deck, which I take a lot of flack for, but holds its own. Looking forward to having a go! [deleted] > Guys, this is the man who slaved away and brought not one, but TWO cooked turkeys to the event!

Haha!  I still have my Reddit Award on my desk.  :D   That Thanksgiving turned out so awesome.  If I weren't hosting some friends this year, I'd be there!  Great job for keeping this going! It would be fun! Let's see how I feel after the turkey and stuffing sets in. Looks like I'm working late tonight so I'll be between Hawthorne and Powell pretty much all day and most of the evening.  I also have to go to John's Landing around lunch time if you are near there. CSGO in /r/portland?  [deleted] This time of the week it might be hard to secure a cooked bird at freddies- plus as a former slave of the deli for them, they won't heat it up for you. oh okay, perfect, thanks! Might come and check out this ol' american holiday :p Bad news, dropped my car off for an alignment this afternoon and it turns out my front suspension is broken. No can do on whole turkey. Sourcing alternatives now. Bacon wrapped turkey breasts will fit in my backpack and I can take my motorcycle.  Northeast - can pick you up from max I can tell you that we used 262 of the initial nametags, although I know a couple were used for labeling food.

Edit: And thank YOU for contributing so much food and effort year after year. Happy holidays, man. what am I gonna do if I get a sudden craving for Mexican? They're out of business already? They just opened back in July. A crotchpot. I don't know, really. SW hills, maybe. That's a great way to look at it.  Let me know if it would make sense for me to delete that previous comment. Red Flags, I also played a couple rounds of We Didn't Play Test This Game Oh shit, you were turkey dude?   Fuck man, I gained four pounds because of you!

Thank you. And if for some reason things get slow in southwest, you can bring all your friends on over later in the day! Is there anywhere I can come get these tomorrow before noon? I kind of dropped the ball. Or, I can come tonight, if its the only convenient time. Winco has them at 48cents a pound.  Please do! We have a very nice time every year. We'll welcome you with open arms, answers to your questions, and probably more than a few questions ourselves.  We'll just be glad to have ya! I know you're kidding, but you got me thinking...how delicious would tacos be for this?? Man, I hope at least one someone wants to bring (as their potluck item) ingredients and tortillas for some badass self serve taco action. I will fund the entire cost...meat and cheese and salsa and guac and tortillas and beans and jalapeños and sour cream (sorry, not an expert at taco ingredients) and whatever else (just give me a paypal address) for anyone willing to make some tiny taco spread happen!

Alternatively, maybe we just need someone to bring a bunch of those Costco Taquitos and some tasty salsa or dip.
 They will do future ventures. This particular one just didn't materialize to be what they had envisioned it would be. Only a crackpot would come up with that. I vote we keep it posted, so people come prepared knowing we were accommodated by some serious Portland figures.  lulz!!!  Yeah, it's been a while. I've already left town, but perhaps I could get my assistant to give it to you if she is around.   Let me know if you'd like me to try to set that up. can I just say that you seem really neat? I appreciate all the effort, time and money you're putting into this, it's lovely and I hope to make it for a bit on thursday! Considering what dish /u/Osiris32 always brings, he's really saying he needs someone to hold his balls for the drive. Thanks for the kind words. I hope you make it out! Sometimes I am swamped taking care of the logistics during the potluck, but come track me down and say hello when you swing by! I'll be the one whose nametag says I'm me :). The more the merrier.
