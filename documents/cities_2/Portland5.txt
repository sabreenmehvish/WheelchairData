Accessibility for a powered wheelchair at Hogan Butte Nature Park? Can anyone tell me whether its accessible or not I was invited to a picnic there but I dont want to go all the way there to find out I can't get around 

thanks in advance  The park itself is ADA accessible, the trail is paved and connects to the picnic areas.  It is a steep road up to the park (main parking is at the bottom) if you have an ADA parking permit there are ADA parking spots at the top, or you could be dropped off and get in the park that way.
