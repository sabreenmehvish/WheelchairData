This guy took his date down Sawtelle Blvd in his modified papasan electric wheelchair!  This is some real white people shit I don't understand. Does the guy need a wheelchair? Is he disabled or just cruisin'? He even did some 360s for us.... show off.

https://gfycat.com/LegalTallFlies My first reaction was a sarcastic "wow, what a lucky girl." But she seems to be having a good time.  So do you park it outside the sushi joint and hope no one jacks it? Or is this merely for cruising up and down the street? If so Sunset Blvd or Hollywood Blvd would probably make more sense. That looks super comfortable. I'd be less afraid someone would steal it (it's pretty unwieldy), and more afraid someone would pee on it. Post this on pics you'll get the front page I saw that chair from across the street! But I didn't know what it was until now Did you ask, was it really their first date? Cuz that'd be badass, of him, and of her. Is that illegal?
 All that really needs to be said about this.  Cruisin' for some attention Oy, you had to say that. He'll never be safe parking in anywhere again.  [deleted] I doubt it's illegal, but if this became a "thing" I could see a city ordinance being considered to limit or restrict its use. It's an oversized motorized vehicle (multiple people) being used on a pedestrian sidewalk for recreational purposes, not handicap purposes. It has the potential to draw scrutiny if it attracts the wrong kind of attention or grows in popularity.  I dunno. Sidewalk obstruction?
