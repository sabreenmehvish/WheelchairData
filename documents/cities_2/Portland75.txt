Gobble Gobble! Information for all those coming to /r/portland's Thanksgiving potluck! That title was embarrassing, sorry. Hope you all still want to come celebrate Thanksgiving again with /u/Purple_Antwerp (host) and all the rest of us holiday orphans!


Over 100 of you have [RSVP'd](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1qbtdg/rportland_thanksgiving_details_and_rsvp_form/) and registered what you are bringing along to this year's [/r/portland potluck](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1q6xyl/no_thanksgiving_plans_well_plan_to_come_to_our/). We have spent a lot of time finalizing arrangements, and it's looking like it will be a total blast. **If you are just hearing about this and would like to come, please RSVP, the more the merrier!**


**Pertinent Details:**

* Located at factory floor at [ADX](http://www.adxportland.com/facility/factory-floor/) starting at 1pm. (417 SE 11th Avenue). 

* People will generally start eating as soon as there is enough food, but feel free to trickle in at your own convenience, because with over 60 dishes coming, there will be 10-15 fresh ones that just arrived pretty much any time between 2 and 6.
 
* This event will have kegs. We will be marking people who are over 21 with a sharpie. Sorry, lame we know. Just no one wants to be the guy who supplied underage people. More fun for everyone!

* Kids welcome, we are wheelchair accessible

* **the one dish we have not actually verified is coming is a turkey :'(. Are you the Turkey Hero /r/portland needs?** We have all the other Thanksgiving staples coming (but if you can make better stuffing or potatoes or whatever than some other stranger, I dare you, come show us!)

* If you are an instrumentalist, a singer, are in a band, do standup, or in any manner are interested in free stage time at the event, please PM me. Eat with us, throw down a set, and then mingle some more!

* **We need more chairs. Never enough chairs. We have tons of tables, but alas..**

* We are aiming to be as accommodating as physically possible, so if you feel too shy, or you do not know what you'd bring, or are convinced this event needs board games, football, a TV, your tablecloths, *anything*, PLEASE PM me, or just show the heck up with what you think we need. 


With 4 times as many attendees as last year, this will be a lovely way to spend the holiday together. Direct all questions to this thread or a PM for now, just so we can stay organized. :) Happy Thanksgiving to those of you not coming!  Hi /r/Portand Thanksgiving attendees.  I bought two turkeys for tomorrow and will be bringing them cooked to keep the oven at ADX free. 

Happy Thanksgiving! Just a side note. You may want to mark people UNDER 21 as sharpies are cheap and it's easier to put a mark on than take one off ;) I'd love to make it, but have other commitments. I can however provide some spare fridge/freezer space for those who need it ahead of time. Or, if you need a kitchen (adequate residential), either Wednesday night or Thursday morning. Thanks again for doing this. You're an awesome person :) Pinatas, board games, funny hats all welcome as well!

Please do RSVP if possible - a headcount would be super useful.

**ANYONE WHO VOLUNTEERS TO CLEAN UP AFTER WILL GET SOMETHING AWESOME TBD**

Looking forward to it! Updating the sidebar with this. Has anyone volunteered a Turkey?  Gobble Gobble? just got home from this event... and i loved every minute of it... thank you so much for putting it on and organizing... it was much better than what i originally had planned... (leftovers and LOST reruns lol)...

 If anyone knows the name/contact info of the brown haired bartender last night, pm me. I have an inquiry. Thanks I should mark them by drawing this face: >:( I like the way you think :) Whereabouts is your kitchen located? I am just wondering if you are near ADX Hey, thanks for your support. This event is tough for us to arrange, and we are really looking forward to it. Maybe I should get a pinata. Good idea. No :'( SO glad you came!! No, nothing that convenient. I'm in SW (Hillsdale) which is mostly car country, though there are many bus lines that run along Beaverton-Hillsdale highway just down the street from me. Oh man.  We need to get this remedied!  

With 60 people, we should probably have two turkeys.  I know they run $20-30...  There is a cooking facility at APX, right?  Maybe a couple of us could get started early and bake some turkeys there?  I've picked up an electric roasting pan, if you would like me to drop it off early in the morning at ADX. Various online sites give the shortest time to cook a turkey as 3.5h, but there is an indication that for that largest turkey that would fit in the roaster (24lb) that up to 8h is possible (the booklet describes that the lower temp (350F) /longer - cooking time results in a crispier turkey. I can afford a turkey if needed, I am seriously unfamiliar with cooking one though. How early would we want to start? I will discuss with the troops right now! I'm happy to throw in on a Turkey, too.  I know Fred Meyer has some fresh ones.  I found a great primer, we'd want to plan on 4 hours of cooking, most likely:
