My friend who uses a wheelchair keeps getting stuck in the subway car/platform gap *at* wheelchair accessible stations. She's had enough.   Sorry but they aren't going to reconstruct entire platforms for the .05% of disabled folks who take public transportation.  It sucks, but I'm sure there is someone on the train who is nice enough to help her get on.  I know if I saw someone struggling I would get up and make sure they could get on.  

The gaps aren't that bad if you go to the center of the platform, towards both ends of the cars its often wider because the train is curving with the rail. What this needs is a video of your (preferably adorable) friend trying to get over the gap in her wheelchair. Aka something they can put on TV. FYI - it may help if the photos were taken from the same angle. The city offers [Access a Ride](http://www.mta.info/nyct/paratran/guide.htm) which may be a better alternative as I believe only around 80 of the 468 subway stations can be considered "Handicap Accessible," and even those may be difficult to navigate. 

Though I understand your friend probably wants independence and it's got to be more frustrating than I could even understand, the city does have programs in place to assist with just this problem.  Your friend's site doesn't seem to load in Chrome: http://i.imgur.com/czGYr.png Unless there is some super cost effective way of resolving this issue not much can really be done.  Maybe a ramp on the trains like the LIRR uses but then you would need someone employed full time to deploy the ramps when needed. NY1 is coming to interview her. Hopefully she'll get some footage of this.  [deleted] It must be an extension, although the only thing I have is jQuerify and TinEye enabled in Incognito. Oh well.
