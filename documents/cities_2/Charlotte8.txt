Handicap camping? So, I am wondering if anyone knows of a place within a few hours drive that has sites for wheelchair accessible cabins and tents in same area? Group of about 6-10 adults and some children. I have found cabin only sites and tent only sites but none that are kinda mixed? KOA usually has both kinds of facilities.
