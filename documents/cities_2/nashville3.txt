The Ms. Wheelchair Tennessee organization is looking for contestants for the title of Ms. Wheelchair Tennessee 2019. There are 3 age categories and *It's not a beauty pageant  This seems like a wholesome pageant. I could easily see it developing a devoted following. Would like to be next? Are they threatening people? I don't like the implication! How much is the application fee / entrance fee? These kind of things can be great for disabled teens who might find it hard to get a regular summer job.  Since it's a 3 day pageant, They include 2 night's stay (Doubletree in downtown  Chattanooga) and a dinner in the $400 application fee.

It's less for the Little Miss and Jr Miss entry fees. Correction: I just found out that it's only $300 this year and that does include 2 nights at the DoubleTree
