Tonight, my cohort and I will be viewing Saturn, the Moon, Andromeda, the Pleiades cluster, as well as the Butterfly cluster at the college I attend. Free to all, bring your friends, bring your kids! Wheelchair accessible.  Wish i had seen this earlier ...  [deleted] Damn wish Iâ€™d seen this earlier! *subscribe* Cool!! Do you all ever look at Planet X? Is there a mailing list for these events? I would have been there if I saw this sooner. Thanks for sharing!  Unfortunately, no. Normal for us as students in the course but not regular to the public. My apologies.
