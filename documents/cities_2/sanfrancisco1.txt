SF wheelchair company employee allegedly tased, choked CEO to death  Why would you escalate something so minor to full on murder? The penalty for first time offender of white collar crime like this is a few weeks in jail and few years on probation. Now they are looking at life without parole I used to work closely with the alleged murderer. Itâ€™s devastating, to say the least. I am shocked and saddened. My heart breaks for the victim and his family.  Must have been listening to The Coup too much
