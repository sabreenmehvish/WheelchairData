Uber Driver Joseph, I Can't Give You Enough ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ When I needed a ride this morning to my doctor's appointment, you didn't give me shit about needing to put my wheelchair in the back. You were friendly and pleasant. You got me there on time. 

And when I left my phone/wallet in your car, I spent my entire appointment quietly panicking. I'd have to cancel all my cards... but before that, how was I even going to get home? Had I left my phone unlocked? Had I left the ringer on? How was I going to pay for my medication?

While I sat there, doing my best to handle myself appropriately while internally freaking out, you *came back.* You **found a nurse, and gave her my phone, so that she could find out which doctor I was seeing and get it back to me before I left.**

When I came out of my appointment, my phone/wallet was waiting for me, safe and sound, and you were gone. Beyond giving a five star rating, I can't find a way to leave positive feedback, only negative. There's no mechanism for tips. 

**I'm left with the conclusion that I just got an Uber ride from a goddamn hero.**
 Praise the super hero https://help.uber.com/h/53539bde-f6f4-4909-85de-fa0b99f82be0

 Hooray Joseph!  That's awesome.  Every time I see a positive post or read an encouraging story, my day gets a little better.  Thanks for sharing the sunshine. Thats pretty cool.
I haven't taken Uber, but I freaked out recently when I left my iphone in a yellow cab. Luckily I had another phone so I could call it, and when the driver heard the ring, he returned to my house to return it to me.
Most people are honest I think, even if they have to go out of their way to be so. That's awesome! Also, FYI for future rides, you can tip your Uber driver in cash. If I have a good ride and cash on hand then I usually tip a couple bucks and drivers really appreciate it. I've had a very similar experience!  But the time I left my wallet in a cab...lol.  The DC cab lost and found number just went to a blackhole voicemail box.  Never saw that things again. But when I left my phone in an Uber, he brought it back to me within 30 minutes (without me contacting them, since I had no phone to do so). Complete this form for him:

It is the Uber 6th Star Award.  https://newsroom.uber.com/finally-a-way-to-give-your-driver-a-sixth-star/

Also tweet at @Uber_Sea.  Jen is the Seattle Marketing Manager.  Tell her to do something nice for him. /r/uber thanks for sharing! refreshing to see a feel-good story on this sub for once! Use lyft. You can tip in lyft.  I think after five stars, anything else has to be dollar signs. Feel good posts [feel good](http://memesvault.com/wp-content/uploads/Feels-Good-Man-Frog-02.png). Thats awesome. Good guy uber driver. Thanks for this. Great on many levels. The best you can do is publicise it. It's a good read, especially for the person responsible. Keep spreading good words! Any time your wallet is out of your possession for an extended period due to being misplaced you should probably replace your cards. You're the man, Joseph! Thanks for being an awesome dude!  ^^Ihopeheseesthis... Similar thing happened to me the other day. I read somewhere you can pay Uber to come jump your car so at 6am I called a fellow and he came right away, helped me jump my car, and I thanked him. I realized he had canceled the drive (= free) as he was driving away.... So really it was just a random stranger coming to help jump my car in the wee hours of the morning. You can Tweet @Uber_Sea with your trip details and they can pass your feedback on. Fuck yeah. Thanks, Joseph! AMA Request Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor UberX! Meanwhile, [here's what cab drivers do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAtwtyTQ0YE) Good to hear ! Also, another reason LYFT is a better service. Easier to reward good drivers who go above and beyond. I mean hats off to Joseph of course for doing the right thing. But is the world really such a cynical place now that returning someone's lost possessions instead of *stealing* them is considered an act of heroism?

When I find something that doesn't belong to me I do my best to get it to it's rightful owner, or at the very least pass it on to someone with the authority or ability do do so. And in my experience 99% of people are the same way. Think he gave me a ride to Seatec asked I played guitar and handed me one. Best leaving home airport ride ever!  atta kid joseph!!! Joseph is the man! Use Lyft. 
Better app
Can leave what tip you want.
Drivers make more money. 
Friendliness is encouraged.  That's some Mumen Rider type shit. Hey /u/stormagnet! I work in the Uber Seattle office - thank you so much for sharing your story. If it's OK with you, I will private message you asking for some trip details so we can make sure to give Joseph the recognition he deserves! I'm not a driver as of yet, I do plan to soon. But my name is Joseph too. I'm proud of this Joseph.  *He make'a five stars.* This makes me happy, there's enough vitriol and shitty news out there, it legit makes me feel good when I see people doing things like this. There's a reason I subbed to /r/UplifitingNews
  I think I know who this Joseph is. Was he driving a turquoise Dodge Stratus with tinted windows? What's sad is that common courtesy now earns you hero status. Someone else's tipping is the only thing that pushed him to do that.

Whenever people tip me, for that day, I'll return the favor. 

When people don't tip me, I don't return shit. Even if they need it. Especially if they need it.

If they explicitly state that they will pay me, then yes. If they try to dodge the question/statement, I will wait until I am at the farthest possible police station and leave it there. Nice! I just got a "Found an item" email from Uber support with his phone number in it, so I can call and thank him in person! :D And yet Len is still searching for more success.... I tend to prefer Lyft now since they seem to have a better relationship with their drivers and still allow for tips. 

Also the whole "Uber's CEO is a terrible person" bit.  Except that's the whole point of Uber.  That you don't have to tip.  It was part of their early marketing.  Raise the prices if drivers aren't getting enough money. I would tip if it was built into the app, but paying cash removes a lot of the convenience of an uber ride.

Then I start to wonder, if tips were added to the app, would drivers start to give shitty votes to riders who dont tip? I tipped an uber driver cash for not flipping out at my obnoxiously drunk friend. I've tipped an Uber driver with a pair of movie ticket vouchers and a candy bar for going through reasonable efforts to return my left-behind phone to me.

He was a pretty good guy. I've never used Uber (simply don't have a need for it, nothing against them), but I've heard countless people talk about being able to tip through the app. They do not not make the functionality noticeable for whatever reason though.  If I had to carry cash just in case I got exceptional service from my Uber driver, I'd stop using Uber. Nice- I was hoping there was something like this! Thank you! I will add though, that a good driver (me) scans the back seat after each client to make sure there is nothing left behind. I should have known there was a subreddit! I'm going to xpost there now, thank you! The good rideshare drivers know this too. That's awesome! What an ass. Pretty much. When I left a phone in a yellow cab the driver refused to return it for a couple hours (because he said he'd miss fares) and then when he said could finally return it he turned his meter on to drive my phone to my location and charged me for the delivery. 

It was my fault for losing it and I'm sympathetic for wasting his time and all but it still rubbed me the wrong way.  I think you mean, "here's what this one particular cab driver did." Though both of these stories are anecdotal and don't necessarily reflect on the service as a whole... 

I have to admit, part of why I was so amazed at how far this driver went to return my phone is because my friend once left hers in a Lyft. 

She realized immediately and used a friend's phone to contact the driver, whose car hadn't even driven out of view yet. He swore he couldn't find it... and then she watched helplessly as her phone's tracking info drove off with him. Jerk totally kept and sold it :C I think some people just don't care and don't steal things, they just don't return them. Anytime I leave something somewhere I consider it gone. 

I left my wallet on a plane early last month, immediately filed a report with the airline for a lost item as I was already home when I realized what happened, and went over 30 days without them responding. I ended up getting an email last week saying they found an article of mine, paid to have it shipped back. Low and behold it had everything in it. Gift cards and all.  Done and done! I don't know much about cars, so I didn't catch the name and model- it was turquoise though :) Good point. Throwing you a parade. You can do more than just thanking him. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Thank you for that Is Lyft really better? I uninstalled it because I got fucking sick of the spam notifications and constant holds on my debit card. I get notifications about every purchase on my card so that got annoying as hell alongside the nag notifications about "deals". I wish I had downloaded lyft instead of uber, but now my phone is too old and won't let me download it anymore. Next phone! Used to use Lyft, but now I'm exclusively Uber after one of the Lyft drivers stole my phone one night. Turned if off less than 5 mins after I left and didn't respond to any of my requests to contact the driver for a missing item. The Lyft customer service didn't help at all. I sent like 5 messages to the driver and customer service and no response. Maybe I got a bad driver, but now there's a bad taste in my mouth about Lyft. care to fill me in on uber's ceo? Yea but if you wanna give someone money for an exceptional job then you still can?  As consumers we can't just "raise the prices if drivers aren't getting enough money." But Uber isn't raising the prices. They're dramatically lowering them constantly, and less and less is going to the driver. I spoke to one of my Lyft drivers about it on the way to the airport, and he mentioned that he gets notably more in his pocket from Lyft.

If "contractors" were paid a living wage, or even given real benefits, I wouldn't feel the need to tip. But they're not. That's the reason I prefer uber over Lyft anyday. 

That's exactly my thoughts are: 
https://youtu.be/vBTfj2lN6sQ agreed. Here is the URL:  
http://t.uber.com/contact

Let them know where you ride and you think their prices should be raised.

Let them know you support a $15 per hour minimum wage for their drivers and benefits and that you'll continue to take Ubers until they do so because you trust in the good ethics of the company. You never HAVE to tip anyone.  You SHOULD tip when you receive exemplary service no matter what the social norm is. Driver here.  You can only tip a "For Hire" or taxi through the app.  You cannot tip a regular driver.  When you first download the app and set a tip %, that only is for the "For Hire" or "Taxi" option.

 Make sure to mention how he handled the wheelchair issue.  ADA access is a huge service issue for us to get right every time. Can you follow me around in life? At least you knew where it was. 
My phone is my life,  😬 and while Ive never damaged a phone beyond repair, or actually lost it for any length of time, I have had phones stolen twice.

Once I foolishly left my purse in the car at my kids school, but I was literally gone for 7 minutes, and it was within sight of sports practice.( kinda) I had noticed a man in the parking lot, but I figured he was someones dad. They broke the window, which apparently doesn't set off the alarm.  My card was used immediately at several gas stations. The more recent time was when I was at a health club and they cut the locks off the lockers.
That time really was irritating.

But on the whole, I have had my property returned to me many more times than I have had it stolen, or defaced. For what it's worth, I'm a Lyft driver and once drove someone to Kent. After getting some gas and driving for about 15 minutes, I heard a noise from the back. Turns out it was an iphone being pinged. Then they called the phone and I answered and explained they left it in my car, and drove back to return it. Unfortunately, some people are just shitty. But we're not all that way.  Was he a Kenyan man by chance? Whenever i receive outstanding service i write an email to corporate HQ / HR / PR or thwir direct manager. One time this Enterprise sales guy rented me Ram 1500 because they didnt have compact car which i originally reserved. He worked out with his manager to get it approved :) so i wrote an email to Enterprise HQ. FOUND JOSEPH I literally received an offer for a threesome from my lyft passenger via text. He said he had a gf. *gulp* That's horrible and I'm kind of mad I didn't think to say that. Calm down, Joseph Ayy lmao The app quality is worse, the service quality is higher. For what it's worth, you can disable the notifications in the settings of most phones. You won't miss your ride since it also texts you. [deleted] FYI: I know you don't need an app to use uber, simply a mobile web browser [https://m.uber.com](https://m.uber.com). I'm pretty sure Lyft offers the same if you login through their webpage. Back up your photos online, and it'll free basically all your space on the phone! How does that work? I have an old iPhone 3s and I think it can still download apps - can't it? Story time!

I was taking an Uber home in San Diego, and after the driver twice couldn't find the hotel that my friend was staying at (that we were directing him to, he just didn't listen), he finally got on the freeway after dropping me off. He starts sliding in and out of the lanes, and says he's "tired." Right about then is when the CHP pulled him over. He stops the ride in the meter and quickly hid away his phone in the glove box (while driving).

Two CHP cars pull up and make him walk the line for a sobriety test. Satisfied that he's not drunk, just tired, they leave. I request the get out of the car. He gets on the freeway again and the doors lock. He still took me home, but the entire way back I was now begging him to let me out.

Uber had no way for me to request help from the app then. And this was basically kidnapping. For my troubles I left a 1 star review and Uber finally credited me the cost of the ride. I emailed back and said that wouldn't be enough and never heard back.

There are horror stories on both sides, but after having that happen in San Diego and now two Seattle Uber drivers take me to Northgate instead of Capitol Hill (while they have maps open and I'm giving directions -- they just seem to ignore what I'm personally saying and trust the map that they're reading incorrectly) I'm pretty done with the service. He's just not a great person and it reflects through the senior management. Here's an NYT [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/fashion/uber-delete-emil-michael-scandal.html?_r=0).

> Emil Michael, Uber’s senior vice president for business at Uber, who suggested that the company hire researchers to spy on journalists critical of Uber’s policies and executives.

> Its founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was quoted in GQ magazine making jokes about how easy it is for him to attract women now, and he has been derided by critics as being blasé about issues of safety for female Uber customers. he's a dick It starts with leaving tips for exceptional service, then soon tips become the norm, and you end up with the restaurant industry. So you hit the nail on the head. Lots of people who believe in a minimum wage for them but who will take uber because no tipping even after they've been told the drivers make zip. The point of not having to tip is that tipping in itself sucks for everyone involved.  If the person receiving the tip relies on that income to survive, then having a bad day can actually be something that negatively effects their well being.  The person giving the tip may feel obligated to give more money than maybe the person earned because of social norms.  The only person who ends up off the hook is the owner.  The owner should just pay their employees a competitive wage, and then they can fire people if they're shitty at service, it's not that hard, and it's how almost every other business in America does it. Aw heck no, and I definitely didn't mean to impugne Lyft. I just thought it was funny that folks keep bringing them up, because at the time I had that story running through my head, so I was already thinking about them but in a totally different context.

What really struck me about my friend's shitty experience- and why I was so amazed at having the opposite- was how *easy* it was. It took a lot of work getting me that phone back, whereas just being a jerk and saying "nope haven't seen it" could mean pocketing a good couple hundred bucks.

It's hard out there, and the world is full of bad news, so when somebody goes out of their way to do the hard decent thing instead of the easy jerk thing, I think that's awesome. Like, it actually leaves me feeling some awe.

So, thanks for being awesome :) I definitely Ubered with a Kenyan man and I think his name was Joseph He was fired that same day. I work at a call center and occasionally we have people say they want to talk to a sup to say what a good job we did. It's usually older folks, it's sweet, but it can fuck your metrics. It lengthens your call time and if you're unlucky, like me, it can mess up other things too. One metric we get scored on is whether or not a customer calls back within a certain time-frame. 

So, I have a customer today, nice old lady, I get her phone fixed and then she says she wants to speak to my manager. I think "cool" always nice to have a good word put in. Well right when she says that I turn around and see my manager about to take an escalation. I tell the nice lady that my boss is busy and she insists that he call her back so she can tell him what a bang up job I did. I thank her and let her know that he'll call when he's able. In all honesty I just figured she was being nice and would probably forget as soon as we hung up. Well about 30 minutes later I get an IM from some other rep telling me this lady called back and was asking to talk to my supervisor. 

I was floored. One, I couldn't believe this lady was so hell-bent on telling my boss she was happy with my customer service skills; and two, I was pissed she dinged me for a call-back which pushes my numbers up which is bad. 

Anyways, not totally relevant but felt like sharing because it happened today. Thanks for reading! But I still have weekly holds hitting my bank account which is fucking wildly inappropriate. I've only used Uber and it was only once. Was great. Butbmy complaint against Lyft is the app. I installed Uber. I've used it once and haven't needed it since and it has stayed out of my way. I've never used Lyft and I had to uninstall it because it was sending me multiple notifications a week and pinging my bank. I've got bad news for you - Lyft and Uber drivers are basically the same people. A good portion are both. Beats me. I can't download any recent software updates because it says there are no updates to install, but it might be a space issue. The restaurant industry (just in America, by the way) didn't start doing tips because of exceptional service. [The more you know!](https://youtu.be/q_vivC7c_1k) I don't think so. I tip if I have the cash, because as an ex-driver, I know how much they're screwed.

On my latest trip to Seattle last week, we had a driver who pretty much took the scenic route, gave us history, showed us around some less known areas on the way to our destination... it was truly above and beyond anything any driver had ever done for us. We had a fiver, and since tour guide is not part of the package, it was well earned. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope Not at all. I wholly agree, they should be paid a living wage, but if I have the money available, and I feel someone in a service industry gave me exemplary service, I should have an ability to tip them. I've given plenty of restaurant employees no tip because they were terrible at their job, but if someone gives me good service, I'm going to tip them well.

As a non restaurant example, I have a tattoo artist I go to when I want a new tattoo because I love the work he does. I tip him very well when I can because he provides a great service to me. God rest ye merry gentlemen. seems like that's the sort of thing your manager should be able to to adjust. [deleted] I'm not telling you to switch. I'm telling you how I personally feel. You get to make your own personal choice based on what you value. The hold issue doesn't bother me since I have it linked to a credit card. I'd imagine that'd be obnoxious for debit. Weekly holds for what, exactly? The trips you've taken? I don't see the issue. I guess the same goes for notifications as well. I use both Uber and Lyft and neither have what I would consider spam notifications. One of the things I liked about Uber was that the price was the price and I don't feel like I'm screwing anyone or being a tightwad. I don't want to have to carry cash in order to not be thought a cheap jerk.

> I tip if I have the cash, because as an ex-driver, I know how much they're screwed.

This is an argument shared by many for tipping in the restaurant industry. It's accepted and understood there, but one of the benefits of Uber was that it was free of this nonsense. If they aren't paying their drivers enough, they need to raise the rates, not have drivers set the expectation on the customer to tip.

Uber's model is supposed to be market-based. If there aren't enough drivers (because drivers exit the market because they aren't making enough) then the rates should and will go up to encourage additional drivers to enter the market. By tipping, you're throwing this off by disguising the actual price people are paying for rides (and the actual value drivers are earning per ride). This causes the market rate to be lower than it otherwise would because it is no longer representative of the actual cost. [deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0614 
55096) Exactly this. One would think.  But that's not how call centers work. Metrics are metrics,  no fudging the numbers for special circumstances at most places.  The reason we track if a customer calls back within a specific time frame is to measure if we actually fixed their issue. I do tech so if someone calls in with a problem and I don't actually fix it  and the person calls back then that's bad. Basically they want us checking in with our customers to 1) make sure we actually fixed their issue and didn't just bandaid it; and 2) that we ask if there's anything else they need so they don't call back.  Lyft constantly puts 2 or 4 dollar holds on whatever card you have associated with it. I only use uber because of no tips. So much better that way Here is the URL:

Let them know where you ride and you think their prices should be raised.

Let them know you support a $15 per hour minimum wage for their drivers and benefits and that you'll continue to take Ubers until they do so because you trust in the good ethics of the company. This is true, but there will constantly be people desperate enough to take it in a race to the bottom to slave wages and people who have no choice but to take them. I don't want all the drivers left to be those "I just arrived in the city, and I barely speak your language or know where anything is or know how to drive" guys you run into more and more. Until the company itself dies, that is, and lets a more fair company take its place. Come on...

Considering people happily give 0 around here, that's pretty good.

Our cash supplies were exhausted on day 2. Seattle's freaking expensive coming from the midwest. Can't be letting humanity get in the way of our metrics! I've never noticed this and I was taking Lyft 2-3 times a week for a couple months. I check my bank account online daily. I've never had this issue. Holds for what, exactly? Employer problem, not consumer I thought tipping $5 for a service that makes a point about how you're not supposed to tip, and for which many people don't tip, was very reasonable. the desirable parts of the country are all expensive compared to tge midwest, that is true Depends how long your bank would show holds. I get instant notifications for every transaction. You'll have to ask them. I don't know. You wouldn't notice it unless you get instant notifications when your card is used. Can confirm. Not very desirable here. The pizza's good, though.
