Anyone know what the wheelchair seating looks like at the depot? I bought tickets to a show at the Depot for later this month. When I looked the venue up on google one of the reviews said that the wheelchair seating is behind regular standing room. Gonna be pretty pissed if I have to stare at people's backs for the whole show. 

I left them a voicemail but haven't heard anything back from them.  From what I remember, take the elevator up to the balcony, and just roll up to the rail. Nobody is going to make you move, most likely you can ask anybody next to you to get you a drink and they will be happy to do it.


No need to use the Americans With Disabilities Act as a weapon. Just ask.


Actually, now that I think about it,,,,,,I went to a Black Label Society show there.  There was one guy in a wheelchair, he was really fucked up, he had the palsy and all sorts of crippled shit. He had the time of his life. 

If you are worried about having a crappy night cause you are in a wheelchair, forget about it. People will go out of their way to make sure you have a good time.
 "Hey man I'd really like to see the show do you mind if I wheel infront of you" 

I dont think anyone would argue.

 Poof! It is gone.38078)
