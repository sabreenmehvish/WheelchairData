Cerebral paulsy in activities in SA? Does anyone know of what possible activities their might be in SA? My fiance and I would like to take the kiddos out today. If anyone knows of special events, fun locations, or any kind of activities that would be fun for a 4 and 10 year old kiddos, both wheelchair bound, we would really appreciate any ideas. I am new to the area, but she's spent her whole life here. I'd like to be able to throw some ideas at her.


Edit: as of right now, we are loading up and heading to the N/NE side to go look for a runaway pup pup that went exploring.  My best friend has cerebral palsy and we always go do stuff like Clay Casa, movies, and we often go to Witte for their free tuesday evenings. You could also look into [Kinetic Kids](http://www.kinetickidstx.org/index.php?id=1). There's lots of fun wheelchair adaptive activities to choose from. My friend has been a part of it since middle school and has made so many friends she can relate to. All of the kids are little sweethearts that are a blast to play with. Morgan's Wonderland maybe?

>__Morgan's Wonderland__ is a 25 acres (10 ha) accessible [amusement park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park) in [San Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), USA for children and adults with special cognitive and physical needs. The park, which opened in April, 2010, was developed by Gordon Hartman,  a former real estate developer from San Antonio. He said that his daughter Morgan, who has a severe cognitive delay, inspired the creation of the park. 

>In 2005, Hartman sold his successful homebuilding business to establish The Foundation so he and his wife, Maggie, could pursue their dream of helping children and adults with special needs. Their devotion to this cause is inspired by their 21-year-old daughter, Morgan. Her soaring spirit despite physical and cognitive challenges sparked within the Hartmans a deep desire to create Morgan’s Wonderland, a haven not only for those with special needs but also for their families, caregivers, friends and the general public.

>The concept for the park is similar to a [sensory garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_garden). It is an example of [adaptive recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_recreation) for children. The attractions are designed to be interactive for children with various abilities and disabilities. The guiding principle for Morgan’s Wonderland is inclusion. “Morgan’s Wonderland is a special place where anyone can have fun,” says Gordon Hartman, CEO of The Foundation, “but it was created with special-needs individuals in mind. Morgan’s Wonderland is just like any other theme park except for the added benefit of a culture and environment that assures 100 percent enjoyment by everyone who enters through our Welcome Center. Unfortunately, countless children and adults with special needs do not have access to facilities that can help them fully enjoy outdoor recreation. We truly hope Morgan’s Wonderland will begin to change that.”

We've know about it but just didn't think about it for some reason.
