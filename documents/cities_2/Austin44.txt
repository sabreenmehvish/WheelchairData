Looking for an adult sized special needs jogging wheelchair to borrow or buy My uncle had a major stroke localized in his brain stem about 11 months ago. He survived and has relearned how to stay awake, eat and talk. He is working on standing and walking but he was a serious athlete before the stroke. He remembered that at his birthday last year that he ran 3 miles and he had a minor breakdown because he just wants to run. I would like to find an adult sized jogging stroller (that is what they're called on google searches) that I can push and start running 5ks with him until he gets back to running shape himself (hopefully in another year!) and was wondering if anyone in Austin had one I could buy or borrow for a race or two. 

I know this is a long shot but he wants to run again and I would love to take him if I can find the right equipment. If anyone could even point me in the right direction, I would be really appreciative.  Best of luck.  You sound like a great nephew/niece to have.  Sorry I am of no help.
