x-post r/pics: Great shot of wheelchair guy in the air at Slayer concert! If you know him, pass it on  This is fantastic  And this is why Metal fans are the best.
 I was about 10 feet behind where he got lifted up... great shot and show! My ears hate me today. That was awesome. By the time we realized what was going on it was the end of the song.  That picture is honestly frame worthy.  Someone with PS skills should photoshop this guy in the foreground. It really is. I so hope he gets to see it. Was he older or younger? Glasses or no glasses?
I think I might know the guy but wanna be for sure before I ask.  I didn't get a good look since I was behind him the whole time but he definitely seemed younger. I didn't see many folks in wheelchairs that night so I imagine if you know someone likely to be at the show, it's them.
