LA City Council Huizar's disgusting explanation for Medical Marijuana Patients who use a Wheelchair and rely on Storefront Dispensaries for their Medical Marijuana  How is this disgusting? Makes sense, you save money and get a new hobby The reality is that high school kids will get their jobs selling weed back! Im sure they're happy. Also, be prepared to be kicked out of your place once your landlord finds out! So much fun! If growing saves so much money then why isn't everyone growing already?

I believe growing high quality medical marijuana is not easy, practical, or realistic for Patients.  Imagine asking a sick person to have a Pill Factory in their Apartment so that they can produce their own Marinol. Hey look everyone! An Asshole! Pills and Plants are different. You can grow 3 ounces for the cost of 1 you would pay at the dispensary
