Graphic video appears to show Wilmington cops fatally shooting man in wheelchair  [deleted] Very convenient to leave out the fact that he had a gun and was shot when he went to reach into his pocket... who fucking cares its wilimgington and hes a criminal Looks like possibly a suicide by cop? He has three cops on him with guns drawn and then he clearly reaches into his pocket. And if he did have a gun, which according to the article the cops are saying was the case, then the wheelchair is kind of irrelevant.  But...but......wheelchair.
