"Vibrant....Winning heart and humor. Critic's pick!" — The New York Times

In her 12th solo play Latin Standards, Marga Gomez performs the loving, funny and true story of perseverance and creative addiction passed down from immigrant father to lesbian daughter. Mixing nostalgia, urgency, and comic edge, Gomez portrays herself as a driven adult child of a Cuban entertainer. Defying reason she attempts to produce a hipster comedy night at a struggling Latino drag queen club during San Francisco’s gentrification crisis. Between vivid portrayals of characters from 1960’s Manhattan to present day San Francisco, Gomez ponders the ballads (or Latin Standards) penned by her late father Willy Chevalier: a comedian/producer/entrepreneur and composer of dance tunes that reveled in jealousy and obsession. Latin Standards premiered Off Broadway at the Public Theater’s “Under The Radar Festival in 2017 and has gone on to presentations in Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco.

Marga Gomez is GLAAD Award and LA (Los Angeles) Ovation Award winning writer/performer of 12 solo plays which have been presented at The Public Theater, La Mama ETC, Dixon Place, nationally and internationally. She was an original member of the Latino performance ensemble Culture Clash. Gomez is also a stand-up comedian. Her appearances include LOGO’s “One Night Stand,” Comedy Central’s “Out There,” and HBO’s “Comic Relief.” Her screen roles include “Sphere” (Warner Brothers) and Tracy Takes On… (HBO). She can be seen on Sense8 on Netflix. Her website is margagomez.com

Director David Schweizer has been developing and directing new live performance work for forty years, from his debut at Lincoln Center with a radical revival of Shakespeare’s TROILUS AND CRESSIDA to his return there with Richard Rodney Bennett’s THE MINES OF SULFUR for New York City Opera. He has proudly directed Marga Gomez’ solo works for many years now including "Los Big Names" "Lovebirds, and "Long Island Iced Latina."
