With the marathon coming up, I wanted to share something I made a few years back, an illustrated course map.  Yo that's a horse on the pike You should submit this to the BAA.  25.2? Isn't a marathon 26.2? 

Edit: That's the mile-to-go mark. Fair enough.  Pro-tip:  don't sit down on the grass in Hopkinton on marathon Monday.   Can I buy a print of this? Source: https://www.capehorn-illustration.com/collections/art_of_the_marathon Beautiful piece of work. which are each of the places? You're right. That's Paul Revere on a horse. Just an Easter egg for people to find. I think it’s someone on those sit down bikes or wheelchairs  By horse you mean Jessica Sarah Parker, right? It is. What I wanted to show was the "mile-to-go" mark.  OP was going in increments of 5. That being said, I agree. It's weird that the end is 25.2 instead of 26.2. Hah--runners can be nasty. You can here, yes.  https://www.capehorn-illustration.com/collections/art_of_the_marathon [Hopkinton](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.2296141,-71.5182926,3a,60y,62h,85.32t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snHVw-jKe5qLCBXxmG0Hx-g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) (you can see both statues)

 Wheelchair dude is on Beacon St. Pike is where the cars are and I definitely see a freaking horse. first marathon actually did start in Ashland and was only ~25mi, IIRC

source: saw the Boston documentary the other night Ah ok, thanks for the explanation. > Ashland

RIP that Dairy Queen. Used to stand over there every year as kids. Look next to Fenway Park I can’t find it. This is the worst Where’s Waldo ever  https://i.imgur.com/wa6UcU0.jpg
