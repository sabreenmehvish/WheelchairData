What are the best free things to do in portland? (Bonus points if they require little to no walking) I'm a social worker of sorts. I assist disabled people in various ways.

One part of my job for many of my clients is known as community inclusion - making sure disabled people aren't just sitting around in their house alone all the time.

Most of them aren't exactly able to spend money, since living on disability isn't exactly conducive to having disposable income. Some are unable to walk long distances or stand for long. Some are more able and have jobs and have a little money to spend on activities, but not many.

So, help make my job easier: What are some good places in the greater portland area that i can take people who are disabled to have a good time for free or almost free? Bonus points if they're handicapped friendly. 

Preferably closer to the east side, as most of the people i work with are on that side of the river.  Attempt direct contact & explain your situation to the following:

 A lot of plays have final practice free for the audience. Portland Shakespeare festival comes to mind but I'm sure most theaters do the same.  Clackamas county library has a pass, Cultural Passes

There is one pass per venue available. Passes may be reserved up to three months in advance by anyone with a library card in good standing.

 Movies in the park - Woodlawn park Maybe trivia nights? I don't know of any specifically, but seems like a good way to socialize on a budget/with limited mobility. 

there are free concerts and movies in parks all summer

people watching/picnic at farmers markets

soaking pools maybe? community pools? $5/ a visit usually and I know that at least some of the pools have ADA accommodations for getting in and out of the water.

peninsula park is in full bloom right now, and there are benches around the perimeter of the garden as well as wheel chair access










[Tyron Creek State Park](http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=103)  If any of your clients have an Oregon Trail Card:

https://www.racc.org/resources/access-arts-and-culture/

https://www.racc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Arts_for_All_English.pdf City has some nice parks. 

Not wheelchair friendly, have to be able to walk uphill/up a handful of stairs: There are a couple places to sit up on Rocky Butte https://goo.gl/maps/iHKpmMpH1uN2

Laurelhurst, Mount Tabor, Alberta, Peninsula, Pier, and Grant Parks all have some nice spots to sit not far from where you can park. The Peninsula park rose garden has an ADA ramp down to the fountain, though some of the paths there are grass not paved, you can see from google streetview/sat view.

The beginning of the lower Macleay trail is wheelchair accessible, but the paved section doesn't go very far. Still can be a nice place right by the entrance though.

The Japenese garden isn't free, and parking there isn't free, but it is a nice place. Can walk slowly to check out a few spots while you're there, nice places to sit and enjoy the environment. It's a steep walk up from the parking lot, but there is a free shuttle from the parking lot to the garden entrance. Most of the garden is not wheelchair accessible. If you were going there on a regular basis in addition to the per visit parking fee it would be per year $55 for a membership for you, and $20 for each annual guest pass added on to the membership (up to 5) - depends how many people you work with at once. Guest passes aren't named, so you could use each one with different people.

https://japanesegarden.org/join-or-renew/membership-types/ I have heard that some of the libraries have a pass you can check out and use to go to local museums and I think even the zoo for free.  May be something to look into.   The library. Shakespeare in the park happens all summer. You would just want to make sure the park its in is ADA accessible. Camping or beach chairs and blankets could be useful too & you can bring your own picnic foods.

http://www.opsfest.org/tour-calendar.html For $9 you can go see Cruisin-In at the Portland International Raceway every Wednesday.  Theres tons of old cars and hot rods that can be viewed, as well as people who race the old cars in a drag race.  

Its a bit more pricey, but definitely worth it if that is something you would prefer. http://portlandonthecheap.com/ 
Portland on the cheap I did private duty hospice for 25 years. I found a metric ton of great films at the myberry. Multcolib.com. One lady actually gave me card. Her family knows I still have it, 5 years after she went to dance with Paul Newman. God, I miss that lady. drinking beer, I rarely have to walk save for the bathroom..... http://ohs.org/museum/visit-the-museum.cfm

 Oh, perfect. Most of them do. Tell me where this free beer is.  That would be perfect if i can figure out how to get there. I don't get a budget for anything (such as parking) and am not supposed to pay things myself.  OHS is downtown on Park between Madison and Jefferson. Is transit an option? Trimet offers discounts for people with disabilities, look up their "honored citizen" program.
