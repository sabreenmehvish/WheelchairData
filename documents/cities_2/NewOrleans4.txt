Man in wheelchair auditions to be a 610 stomper dancer  Hmmm this might get interesting. They kinda almost have to let him in or else they look like dicks? Or it’s just a great way for them to look good by letting him in? The first thing my mind went to when I saw this was how this city loves and celebrates Steve Gleason. The 610 Stompers perform at Saints games. I think it would be incredible to see them at a home game Gleason attends. I could see this guy teaching Gleason some moves. he's one of the finalists They posted his audition on their Facebook page. My guess is that means he’s gonna make it in some capacity. It’d be a pretty bad PR move to get all our hopes up and not let him in.  Wouldn't it depend on how he does?  Not really. They have routines and if he can’t do the routines then they can pass him up. The same way they pass up on someone who tries out but isn’t a good dancer. It’s a dance group first and foremost. They are paid to perform, they have uniforms, etc.  Yeah that’s what I was thinking... Not once he showed up in the wheelchair.  Those guys are pretty intense and cover a lot of ground on their parade marches; wonder when we'd see this guy? I think they also do a bunch of smaller events that might be less taxing on an individual in a wc. Hope he makes it.
