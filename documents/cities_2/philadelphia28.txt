Disability Resources for Social Activities? Hey guys! Iâ€™m back in the area after a few years away, and I need some help! Does anyone know of good and fun places for someone who has a physical disability (using a wheelchair), maybe even with a hint of LGBT positivity thrown in? Any book clubs that meet at public places or other good social activities would be great. Also, maybe looking for physical activities that can accommodate physical disability. Maybe a yoga instructor that could do private training or martial arts that are familiar with disability? 

Someone I love seems a little depressed and could use a few good and healthy additions to their life. Thanks in advance for the help! The Free Library has a ton of activities on their website in a bunch of categories. Poking around on there is a good start. you should touch base with kerri hanlon at yoga home in Conshohocken I know it's not exactly center city but I would contact her she may make exceptions to come do personal yoga.
