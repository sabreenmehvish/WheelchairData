New DC Dunkinâ€™ Donuts location snubs those in wheelchairs  One thing to always remember that plans =/= what's built. It's someone's oversight for sure and the blame ultimately lies with DD, but it also could have been a lazy contractor and no one caught it. Am I missing something in the pics posted?  It certainly appears as though one could roll right from that sidewalk into the store.  Where are the stairs, inside the door? Snub - maybe? Oversight - maybe?

Let's reserve the fire and brimstone until we actually see a corporate response that says DD's doesn't care about accessibility.  I was just in there yesterday and it's true that there's no ramp, but honestly there's like 1 or 2 steps down into the store. Not like it's a full flight of stairs.

I don't mean to sound callous but I really don't think we need to throw a hissy fit every time society doesn't meet every single need of every single person. They are calling this "a flagship store" with "a brand new cutting-edge store design" and they didn't think about how people other then those that are walking can get in.  No matter what language they use, it's sickening that they didn't consider how people can get into the store.

source for phrases: http://www.popville.com/2013/06/dunkin-donuts-k-street-dc/ Try going down "one or two stairs" in a wheel chair and you may just end up needing one. Maybe we can save the rage for all the public transit systems in the US that still aren't accessible. 

 Do we have confirmation of how much control they had over the accessibility issue and how much the building's owner did?
