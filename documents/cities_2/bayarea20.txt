On Tuesday I went over to McClures Beach in Tomales Bay State Park I live in Petaluma so it took well over an hour to get there but it was so worth it. There were maybe 5 other people there and it felt like I had the beach all to myself. I highly recommend it if you have an afternoon to kill. It's a 10 minute walk from the parking lot. You can't tell from Google Maps, but the parking lot is a couple hundred feet up in elevation so it isn't accessible by wheelchair, stroller, any walking-assist devices, etc.
