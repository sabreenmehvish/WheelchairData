Cab Companies Get More Mandates, While Little Pressure On Uber, Lyft To Expand Wheelchair-Friendly Service  as an uninformed observer, 33% of the fleet being wheel-chair accessible seems really high and would impose a heavy financial burden on the cab companies Coming out of the Lansburgh last night waiting for my uber I watched a taxi driver get chewed out by a policeman over the squadcar loudhailer for failing to help a wheelchair user (an old lady) into his cab.  She instead had to ask other people coming out of the show to help her in.  Taxi driver seemed quite annoyed to have to get out of his vehicle.
Anyway, this anecdote doesn't say much about uber/lyft, but it greatly reinforced my perception of taxi drivers.   So? Cabs are still fundamentally different than Ubers. I can't stand by the bus stop and wave down a passing Uber. Different rights (street hails), different responsibilities. One is a fleet car, the other is personal. >The bill would not force the tech companies to meet any quotas, but would require they report data on the number of WAV requests they receive and how much time it takes to respond. If a ride request cannot be satisfied in under 30 minutes, Uber, Lyft, and other ride-hailing apps would have to forward it to a central dispatching system in the successful TransportDC program for paratransit passengers.

This is see is huge for the cab companies and should (if the cabbies were smart) open the door for discussion about being pushed fares during surging times. If surge occurs when theres a shortage of cars for demand then allowing cabbies to be delegated ride request would normalize that supply and demand. Whatever you think of Uber's claims about its relationship with its drivers (they claim the drivers are independent contractors, other people call bullshit and say they're really proper employees), the fact remains that their business model is people coming to them to drive, not seeking out drivers. I don't see how it's sensible to insist that they need to meet certain fleet requirements. 

I'd also point out that in more than one city they've provided a handicap-accessible option. Even if you're not on a street where you're never going to be able to flag down a cab because cabs just don't patrol there, you're still stuck hoping that a handicap-accessible cab actually rolls by and isn't already taken.

Even with a relatively small portion of Uber cars being handicap-accessible, it seems to me that it's still a marked improvement over before. You can have a handicap-accessible cab come right to your front door and your overall wait time is still probably less than it was if you had to just hope to see a handicap-accessible cab call by. Sure, you could call a traditional cab company but we all know how reliable they are about showing up within their ETA, if at all. 

This is the sort of thing that makes me think it's pretty clear that if you're getting hung up on "Uber gets to play by different rules" that you don't actually care about the actual experience of people needing handicap-accessible rides-for-hire.  33% seems excessively high given that Uber/Lyft would have probably launched a WAV platform (or at least incentivized more drivers to WAV-ify their vehicles) if even 5% of their fares were wheelchair bound.  I agree.  33% would assume 33% of the population is handicapped.  Imagine if parking lots had 33% handicapped parking.  This is another example of regulations making no sense. [deleted]

In other words, should you be required to retrofit your car in order to drive for Uber for the 1 circumstance per year in which that will be necessary? No. I don't think that should be the case. If you're disabled and need specialized transportation, you have multiple options to get them between the cabs (present and future), MetroAccess, and others. While we're on the "well you clearly hate the disabled" path, I also don't think having a handicapped tag should entitle you to free parking at meters. Handicapped meters? Absolutely. But free parking at them, as we see in so many cities? Pray tell, why. i think it would be a regulatory thing by the city / state. So if surge goes above lets say 5X then they start delegating rides to taxis in the area. Sort of what they're doing now with the handicapped rides. Not saying uber wll like it... but it goes hand and hand with what they do in miami. Surge legally cant go above a certain % there and that was a law set up by the state. [deleted]
