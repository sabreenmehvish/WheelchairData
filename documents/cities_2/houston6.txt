Atascocita HS student in wheelchair since age 13 walks stage at graduation - Awesome standing O  I was there watching my nephew graduate. It really tugged on my heart strings as the entire stadium stood to their feet clapping as this young man got out of his wheel chair and walked across the stage. It was the longest standing ovation that I have participated in.
