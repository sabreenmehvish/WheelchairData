Unlikely I am going to find someone, but if you are disabled and want 2 free Ween tickets for tonight's show at 6:30. I've got 'em. A friend came into town and last minute I have to cancel going to the show. The tickets are for patrons with disabilities, so if you're in a wheelchair or anything like that, and want to go see Ween tonight, I would love to send you the tickets. Oh I should mention, one person can be a non-disabled guest. Sorry you have to miss the show. I'm going tomorrow night but if I wasn't working tonight I would take you up on your offer because two nights of ween would be awesome.
  Ah f\*ck, if ONLY I had seen this yesterday! I'm so fucking stoked for the show tomorrow. I've never seen them live and I'm fairly certain I'm going to lose my shit.  Hell yeah! I have been to many concerts but last summer was my first ween show.......the best man. Enjoy the show! Yeah man I've seen Ween like 15 times, they will burn the fucking place straight down.  I'll be there in a few hours!
