What's the ghetto bird screaming today? It's been circling above me in Land Park for the last 5 minutes. Something about a wheelchair and needing to call 9-1-1. From their [website](http://portal.cityofsacramento.org/police/news-alerts/helicopter-notifications): 

air1 assisting ground units in attempting to locate missing person. Missing person is Jonah huddleston, male white 22 y/o, in a wheelchair with orange rims, 140-150 pounds, red/brown goatee and scruffy hair on cheeks, wearing wine colored long sleeve sweatshirt, gray pants with white stripe and white half socks
