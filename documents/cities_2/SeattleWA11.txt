This man in federal way needs help building a wheelchair for his dog. Can anyone help?  Maybe give this place a call?

http://www.seattledogspot.com/dog-news/whidbey-island-company-has-made-dog-wheelchairs-for-over-50-years/ Aw. I cross-posted to /r/federalway. That's kind of you to try and get the word out. :) I hope he manages to find someone to help him out.  UPDATE: u/cerealdeamon from r/skookum has been in contact and arranged a meet up for later this week. Thank you all for your kind words and efforts. Anyone know how large/small Soldierboy is?

I found [this](https://seattle.craigslist.org/tac/for/d/dog-wheelchair/6395309197.html) but idk if it'd fit. I could get it to the guy tomorrow maybe.  Gah, fuck!  SoldierGoodBoy more like it.  Stop cutting the onions, Jesus.  

If he gets help, I got to see a pic or a video, I'll fuckin' lose it. If we get any kind of 'group effort' going or whatever I have a 3d printer and some modeling skills I can offer. Just shoot me a message.  I’m not sure but u/floralamethesysts thinks they might know who it is This sucks. Had a dog I loved very much whose hips went out over 3 years, aka 21 doggo lights years. It's hard too watch.

I have fairly large bottle of several canine anti inflammatories I could hook bro up with. U/cerealdeamon

RIP Brick Dog Who the fuck writes like this?  This guy is probably mentally ill.  Be careful. Thank you! u/cerealdeamon has been in contact with Carl and they have plans to meet up. If you would like to organize a group effort I would start there. Thank you so much.  You may have meant u/cerealdeamon instead of U/cerealdeamon.

 ^^**-Srikar** Jesus fuck you must be awful to walk down a city street with. I think I’m more scared of you. Umm you think a polite, hand-written Help Wanted flyer with a few minor grammar errors makes someone potentially dangerous and probably mentally ill. What the fuck is wrong with you? You sound pathetic lol is daily living an absolute terror for you? Mentally handicapped maybe. Nothing to indicate mentally ill... How so?
