Best tourist things to do for someone who can’t walk long distances? My grandmother is coming in to visit next month! We are planning the weekend with her but are finding most of the things we usually do require a lot of walking! Anything ideas??? Phoenix Symphony?

The botanical garden has wheelchairs for rent just inside the main entrance Most attractions have both motorized scooters and wheelchairs available for rent. My MIL used a scooter at the Botanical Gardens the last time she went there and it made her day there pretty enjoyable.  You might find that it is cheaper to rent one from a medical supply place for the period that she will be in town unless you will only use it for one or two places.   Grand canyon Good to know! I didn’t realize the botanical garden had wheelchairs! We may choose to go there, thank you!
