Governor Herbert VETO DUI at 0.05 Blood Alcohol Level  Suggested alternate title:

PETITION:  Governor Herbert VETO DUI at 0.05 BAC.

As it appears here, it made me think it was a news item.   Terrible Stock Photo on the link. Those people are not having .05 fun, they're having .09 fun at least.  Why even bring up lost tourism in Bears Ears and other parks...he has proven he doesn't care about that at all. 

He's not going to veto it...the lds church and its non-drinking voting bloc will go ape. He's not going to go against a large majority of his own party's lawmakers and veto a social regulation bill they passed.  Soon you will get a DUI for using mouthwash  Good luck with that. [More ways to get involved](http://us10.campaign-archive2.com/?u=e6831e0ba622dfe9b20d47874&id=a141d5a952) As a commuter cyclist, and heavy drinker, I'm ok with this legislation. Man, people around here really want to defend the rights of inebriated drivers. I used the headline of the article. Usually if I change it I get ripped apart for  plagiarizing lol Here's an idea... DON'T FUCKING DRINK AND DRIVE! Then you wont have to worry about what the BAC is. People keep making the argument that texting and driving should be punished just as much as a DUI. As someone that responds to multiple car accidents a week, I can assure you accidents involving drivers that have been drinking, far out weigh the ones that involve drivers that have been texting. I see people every day texting and driving, and it pisses me off. But in my personal experience, they just are not causing as many serious/injury involved accidents. Its so much less selfish to just call an uber or a friend.  I too was shocked that he vetoed it! Then I was let down [deleted]

Which brings up the question... Can you get a DUI in a wheelchair?  What about a powered wheelchair?  Let's discuss over some beers I feel like they should extend UTA service another hour if they do this, make last train at 12:30ish. And then I am also ok with this. Shit like this keeps people from moving here Some people don't think you should have your life ruined for having a mimosa with brunch. What rights? Are you familiar with due process for alcohol dui?  [deleted] Same.  I actually was like, that can't be true. A guy in Riverton or Bluffdale got a DUI on horseback a few years back. They don't take away anything except your money.

Wheelchair, I betcha if it's motorized you absolutely could.  Non-motorized, I'd say it's possible, because you can get one on a skateboard, and they're very similar in concept. Seriously. Extending transit hours and developing a parking system that would enable people to leave their cars overnight without having to worry about a ticket would do a lot more to reduce drunk driving than this money grab For as much money as UTA is draining from us, I think it should run 24/7. I have googled around for some rough estimates for drinks and BAC. Is there any context behind the "one drink and you are over the limit" mindset going around?

From what I have [found](http://mcwell.nd.edu/your-well-being/physical-well-being/alcohol/blood-alcohol-concentration/bac-calculator/)  it would be about 2.75 beers in one hour for someone my weight (150) to hit 0.05.

That seems fine to me, as it allows a drink during a meal. Maybe not optimal though. 

But are there other better estimators that are saying one drink would put you over the limit? I tend to think that endangering people's lives is a bigger deal than a minor inconvenience, so agree to disagree I guess. Not being sanctimonious. And maybe I should have made myself a bit more clear. I'm not against the couple beers or couple glasses of wine with dinner. Most people I know, hold their alcohol pretty well. All I am saying, is if you aren't sure if you should be driving, then don't be an dipshit and put the general public in danger.  [deleted]

 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/53251) got a link? i was under the impression you couldn't get a DUI on a horse, might be wrong though.  No, that's probably accurate. It's a bit of hyperbole. > The most frequently recorded BAC among all
> drinking drivers in fatal crashes in 2010 was .18
> g/dL, more than twice the legal limit in every State

US Dept of Transportation  If the state really gave two shits about people's safety they would make texting and driving just as serious an offense as drinking and driving. It's equally as dangerous, but unfortunately it's not against the word of wisdom so it's a minor slap on the wrist. We have the lowest DUI's of any state in the nation, this is simply the church pushing their agenda on the residents of Utah.  [deleted] > a bit of hyperbole. 

It's literally the entire point. Is this supposed to be evidence?  You're arguing that .18 is more dangerous than .05, which I never would disagree with, but is also not the issue.  The only relevant question is whether .05 poses an unacceptable risk, [which the NTSB definitely thinks it does](https://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/Pages/2013_Impaired_Driving_BMG-FAQs.aspx).  Along with basically the rest of the developed world. FATAL crashes.
That doesn't count all the crashes where there were only injuries, no matter how serious. If they really gave two shits they would enforce DUI's harder. I know a guy with 3 of them and has never even had his license suspended or an interlock.  Yes.  The Church has so much pull in [Europe, Asia, and Australia](http://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/world-map-of-blood-alcohol-content-limits-via-ntsb_100428129_l.jpg), which is why all of those places have already made this change.

Seriously man, not everything that inconveniences you is caused by the Church. Yeah I read what I said again, and I can see how I came across like that. My apologies.  This is also true. It shouldn't be based on how much money you have or how great your lawyer is. I doubt our state lawmakers were compelled by foreign countries policies on alcohol consumption, this is part of the churches agenda to try and discourage drinking here in the state. But hey maybe I'm wrong, I'm sure all those countries will issue a statement in support of Utahs bill too, just like the Church did last Wednesday night.
