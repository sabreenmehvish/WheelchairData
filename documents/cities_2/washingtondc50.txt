Two extra tickets to the National Christmas Tree Lighting can be yours! **edit: The tickets have now been claimed! Have a great time, /u/Jack_Commenter!**

I have a pair of extra standing general admission tickets to the National Christmas Tree Lighting today that are open to the first available person who wants them. I know it's rather short notice, and the starting/"be in your seat by" times are rather inconvenient, but hey, they're gonna go unused otherwise!

From the tickets themselves:

* Gates open at 3 PM.
* All attendees must pass through security screening and be in their seats no later than 4:30 PM.
* Strollers, wheelchairs, and diaper bags are allowed.
* Prepare for searches of all items carried onto the site.
* Prohibited Items: tablets, iPads, tripods, monopods/selfie sticks, video recorders, bags (including purses, backpacks, duffle bags, suitcases), drones or other UAS, animals (other than service/guide dogs), bicycles, folding chairs, umbrellas, balloons, coolers, glass, glass bottles/containers, thermoses, air horns, thermal/metal containers, signs/flags of any kind, sticks/poles, pointed object(s) (including pocket knives), food, liquids, aerosols, hazardous materials, chemical materials, radiological materials, biological materials, tobacco products, lighters, firearms, ammo, any weapons, fireworks, laser pointers, Tasers, pepper spray, toy weapons/knives, scissors, razor blades, needles, Leathermans (or similar), screwdrivers, anything else potentially hazardous to safety, alcohol, and controlled substances. A group of friends and I went last year. One of my friends was going to dinner afterwards and needed to bring celery. Security confiscated the celery when we were going through the check point stating it could be used as a weapon. After the show we went back to the checkpoint and was able to find and retrieve said celery. So all was good. Hey, I'd love to have them if they're still not taken. Thanks so much!

Edit: OP delivered. Thanks again! important to note on the selfie stick ban .. i volunteer at these events and the USSS seizes an unbelievable amount of selfie sticks at each of them I will take them if things don't work out! Also down to take these! I went a couple years ago with my gf. It was a fun experience and worth going to. The tree was a little underwhelming though. Might be because we were so far back. Still available? I would love to take them I went last year. I saw Obama, Michelle, and Tom Hanks. It was cool. I would love them!

edit: nevermind. didnt realize it was today. sorry. thanks for the offer! Hahahahaha oh my god that list of prohibited items.  good. It's not worth going if I can't bring my air horn and screwdrivers.
