Real Estate Agents Specializing in Accessible Housing? My husband and I may be looking to buy soon. 

Anyone work with a great real estate agent who is good at finding very specific types of housing? My husband is in a wheelchair, and we have some specialized needs regarding layouts/size of entrances and certain rooms/etc. (which luckily we can articulate, but it would be nice to work with someone with experience/who specializes in accessible housing). 

Did a quick search and didn't see anything -- pretty nichey.  You could try working with Redfin. They're the "Low Cost Leader" and they feature a rebate program that allows you to get half of your agents commission back as a big check, or applied toward closing costs. They can do this because their agents are salaried employees, rather than living off of commissions entirely.  Clientele are largely first-time homebuyers purchasing properties between 200-400k, which is on the lower end for San Diego. 

For the recordâ€“I don't work for Redfin. I know all of this because my ex works for them. 

Good luck!
