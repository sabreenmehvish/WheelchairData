Po/r/tland Thanksgiving III - it's on! Hey folks!

Thanks to the generosity of /u/portlandpuff (and thanks to all others who offered), we have a location capable of hosting all of us!  And thanks to the moderator for the support and making these sticky.

**What:** /r/Portland Potluck Thanksgiving

**When:** 1pm-8pm (show up anytime!)

**Where:** [623 NE Thompson](https://www.google.com/maps/place/623+NE+Thompson+St,+Portland,+OR+97212/@45.5387103,-122.6591913,3a,52.5y,5h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sED4TtoTlvxv5z4XX8tBngw!2e0!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x5495a7497b9ab46d:0xfa4fc9acc2c402af!2s623+NE+Thompson+St,+Portland,+OR+97212!3b1!3m1!1s0x5495a7497b9ab46d:0xfa4fc9acc2c402af!6m1!1e1) - Blue house, rainbow porch.

**Who:** All welcome!

[RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zJ-53L_P8MDuMSuH_Jj5uCuPqwfeHtJWijViHHBmy-Q/viewform) if you think you'll attend so we can estimate head count and figure out if we're missing anything!   Do note there will be a couple of dogs there if you have allergies, and we'll also need folks to help clean up afterwards for anyone staying late :)

We also to know if anyone needs wheelchair access (we can make this happen!), and **need** tables or folding chairs.

Other than that, all are welcome and we look forward to another great year - please [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zJ-53L_P8MDuMSuH_Jj5uCuPqwfeHtJWijViHHBmy-Q/viewform) if you're likely to come!

Cheers! I already RSVP'd. But i just want to say how nice of a gesture this truly is.  I moved here about 4 months ago ( yes, I'm one of those) but its nice to be able to go somewhere on Thanksgiving.

Edit : for dessert i m bring a Oreo crusted, peanut butter cheesecake.  So I offered our house because I thought it was awesome of the organizers to looking for a place that could accommodate kids. We have young kids and it really limits our ability to go, well, anywhere.  Therefore, parents with kids - please come!  We have a **dedicated playroom** set up.

We will be airing all the **football games - all day**!

I'm told there will be **card games** and **board games**.

 Already RSVP'd but can bring 5 folding chairs and a card table if needed.  Also have a larger folding table, but it is a bear to haul in the car, so wouldn't try to bring it unless necessary. **If you or your work or someone you know can lend us a folding table, please PM me. Even card tables.**

I will haul it for you in my pickup if needed. We just want maximum space for food spreads, eating, board games, etc. My husband had a really good idea for sorting the food. There can be signs in the different areas to let people know whats in that area.

/r/all Sorry for being a bit late, work was unkind over the last few days.  But the sidebar is now updated with the new info. Just RSVP'd! I want to throw out a huge thank you to the folks putting this together. I haven't been in Portland very long, all of my friends and family are out of state. It will be wonderful to have somewhere to go on Thanksgiving and have a chance to meet new people and make some friends. Definitely looking forward to it! Cheers! Hi everyone! Brand spanking new to the community and think this is a groovy idea and really want to attend. RSVP'ed, but wondering:

Anyone able to carpool? I live in the Tanasbourne area and might be able to get a ride there, but might not be able to get a ride home. So anyone near or coming from this direction? I,too,already RSVPd, I have two folding chairs I can bring. I'll be driving back from family in WA, but should be in Portland around 8.  Hoping folks are still up for adventure.  Is there an after party somewhere?  http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2lnz0w/no_thanksgiving_plans_lonely_thanksgiving_plans/ Would anyone be driving from inner se? the bus taking me there from where i'm from would take about 45 min to an hour and im planning on bringing my slow cooker.  Just RSVP'd. I'll try to bring something but I don't really have a way of transporting home-cooked food (just moved here and don't have my own place yet) I've picked up a turkey. If someone else has already promised one elsewhere let me know and I'll leave it in the fridge. It should fit in the electric roaster, so I just would need to know what time it should be ready. I'm going to make an effort to come to this! I think i can be there for a little bit, but possibly not until later in the evening - have to check the times on my other friends thanksgiving bash. 

thanks for organizing this! We had so much fun last year, hoping to make it again! I'm holding off on RSVP until I know for sure, but expect me and some delicious side dishes! Is there a confirmation for my RSVP? So excited for this! How much food should I plan to make? Bringing a side dish/salad. [deleted] I was going to make sangria..but then I looked at my bank account and decided not to. Then I was going to make some really awesome brussels sprouts...until I looked at my bank account and decided not to. Now I'm going to make decent brussels sprouts...but at least they'll be vegan? I RSVP'd last night for my husband and I.  We'll be there mid-afternoon, with tasty sweet potato casserole in tow...thanks you guys for doing this, we have family who's ill and not up for entertaining, and our son is a college student who's gonna be spending most of his time back home with friends. So we're feeling a bit orphaned and thankful to spend time with the Internet, lol!  I was feeling a bit under the weather the past couple days and couldnt make it to the store to pick up the ingredients for tomorrow so I'll probably just bring a couple games with me  Just RSVPed.  Hope I'm not too late.   [deleted] Pics or it didn't happen:)
 Much food! Such people! So thanksgiving! Wow. The Potluck was amazing, everyone was real and friendly. This was my first Thanksgiving away from home, so this was very much needed. Thanks you guys.

-Sam After party at the Rose and Thistle!  23rd and broadway! Welcome!  You'll be in good company :) > for dessert i m bring a Oreo crusted, peanut butter cheesecake.

I'm banning all of you right now so that this can be mine. Guh, I would go just for the cheesecake. You are awesome!  I'm sorry I won't be able to join but I love this whole endeavor. Thanks again! So, I don't need to bring my TV then?  Or should I anyway so we can watch more games at more times? Damn I'm so glad and lucky you exist :)  We will definitely need both tables!  I can pick them up in my pickup on wednesday depending on where you live if it helps! Seconded! Hah genius!  Want to make checkbox cards and bring em? Not at all and thank you as always! Look forward to having you! I'm heading over from the area but will be taking Trimet. Please do bring! Awesome There often is.  Though due to the change of venue it's going to be more of a "see where the wind takes us" kind of thing. Working on it... keep an eye on /r/portland for updates! Not SE (though I may be able to swing by) but from inner SW I certainly can. What are your crosstreets?  PM your email and Ill send it out in the reminder email! Cleanup help always welcome!  Or arrive around noon to help set up! Hey!  I think we'll need a couple, so please bring it if you can!  We'll be starting around 1, so 1 to 3 probably ideal time :)  Thank you, turkey hero! People come and go all day, so no stress! Drop an RSVP either way... we may or may not have some black box algorithm that predicts turnout! [Insert formal letter of welcome here] MAKE AND BRING ALL OF THE FOOD. Id ballpark enough for a few people!  Most folks are bringing food so like 3 to 5?  Look forward to having you and thanks!  I know /r/terrasky33 is looking for a ride - thanks for offering! No worries, you're welcome empty handed as well! Welcome!  Bring a table if you can  :P Sounds good!  See you tomorrow! I've got all the expansions for Cards Against Humanity(including the bigger blacker box) and Superfight and Adventure Time Munchkins :) Not at all! The eagle flies at midnight.  Target 2 is priority.  Go loud as last resort.

Also bring tables if you can :)  See ya soon! I am so glad you came! You could always go to your own thanksgiving first and then bring those people to this afterward! Nope, we've got you covered!  I may drop them off at the site earlier in the day (noonish) as it looks like I'll be giving a ride to others for the event. Worst case scenario is that my ride gets me there and I take Trimet back :P So it's all good I wonder if someone would be so kind as to let me know?   I could provide an email or phone.  Or I could check here... would Reed college area be too far out of your way? (28th and steele-ish) OK, I'll have it ready in that window. I gave them a shout!  I already bought the sprouts :) We're getting ready to be all presentable and junk, and we will bring a table with us! (Also the college man has elected to join us, so there's that too...)  Your games were such a hit! Thanks for bringing them. Roll in on target, fire for effect.  Bring the rain. Awesome, more room for the meatballs! Thank you so much! Referencing the past years, it is 100% likely that updates will happen in this thread or a day-of thread! I'll have my phone, so I can send you a message.  You may want to send one to me fist, because despite claims to the contrary from various people who know me, I AM in fact human and prone to forgetting things. Hey there, if the above offer doesn't work out let me know. I would have no problem swinging by to pick you up. But I have signed up to help set up, so it would be earlier in the day. Should be no problem. PM me the time you'd be ready to go and the address (I'm not on setup, but do want to drop some stuff off around 1pm). I am unreasonably excited for these brussels sprouts. See you soon! Mmm meatballs. thanks for the offer, i'll let you know :) Aah that's too much pressure. Now I feel the need to add non-vegan things to them. Swedish meatballs from my grandma's recipe.  I'm getting started on them tonight. Hey there, you set for a ride? Let me know if not… Can swing and get you about 1230 or 1245. I am a plebe who always cheats and uses bacon with my sprouts, so I have no sage advice to offer :) [deleted] double checking to make sure the person offered still can.. will update in a minute as long as they're online now  Good thing, because I have no sage! In a gravy made from beef stock, bacon drippings, cloves, paprika, and rosemary. I'm running Late, just checking before I leave. Have you heard?h Okay, now you are just being cruel. I am trying so hard not to eat until the party.  yeah I should be there in about 7 hours. everything's good I sneaked two more when you were not looking.  cool!  Naughty
