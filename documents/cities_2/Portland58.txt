It is LEGAL to lay parked scooters down & to put them completely out of the way so that a clear path at least 6' wide exists on the sidewalk (even if it means moving them completely off the sidewalk) If scooters are parked on the sidewalk, for everyone's safety, please do 2 things: 

1) Move them *completely* out of the natural path of pedestrian traffic, clearing a path that is at least 6' wide. This is so that 2 wheelchairs, which are regularly 32" wide, can comfortably pass each other (this is the law). This means that if a section of sidewalk is 6' or less wide already, you can place scooters behind/under shrubbery or in areas occupied by trash/recycle cans. 

2) Lay them down so they aren't hazards to fall on animals or pets.  They have kickstands? 2 actually makes them *more* hazardous. Being laid on the ground people won't see them and trip on them. Especially people looking at their phones while walking (which I'm doing as I type). 

I will say don't leave them at bus stops. It makes boarding passengers with mobility devices very difficult. Thanks, grandma. Throw them into the Willamette for increased safety but of you lay them down, they take up more space??? And they're harder to see... wtf? No, nice try but I’m not doing your job for you. Some aspects of the hate against scooters is so manufactured, and ridiculous:

Helmets - haters don't give a shit about helmets.  People bike w/o helmets all the time, where's the widespread hate/"concern" for them?

Sidewalk parking - haters don't give a shit about sidewalk obstruction.  Thousands of outdoor restaurant seats restrict the sidewalks across downtown, where's the hate for them?  

People make up stupid reasons to justify visceral dislike of scooters.  I’d say don’t worry about it. LoL Just stick 'em under the nearest shrubbery like this random stranger told you to.
