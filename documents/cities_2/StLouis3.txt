Police looking for public's help to locate missing man with MS who is confined to wheelchair  This is one of my friends. If anyone see's anything please call the authorities. This is very concerning. I've heard that he has been found and is being evaluated, but no other information beyond that Please edit this title to indicate he has been found.  [deleted] Glad to hear he was found safe.   Curious what backstory is here.   Hoping it was something positive. If it helps, I have MS, and you can make fun of my monkey scrotum. http://fox2now.com/2018/06/12/hayden-clarke-found-safe-in-city-of-st-louis-after-disappearing-monday/amp/
