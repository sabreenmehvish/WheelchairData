Megabus Sacramento! Have you heard of it? I'm guessing most reddit readers have heard of Megabus. You can travel to the Bay Area or Sparks, NV from Sacramento for as little as $1. Pretty sweet! The pick-up station is at the 65th street light rail station. You can only order the tickets online. The bus is pretty comfortable and wifi is included. Check out their site [here](http://us.megabus.com/JourneyResults.aspx?originCode=415&destinationCode=414&outboundDepartureDate=1%2f30%2f2015&inboundDepartureDate=&passengerCount=1&transportType=0&concessionCount=0&nusCount=0&outboundWheelchairSeated=0&outboundOtherDisabilityCount=0&inboundWheelchairSeated=0&inboundOtherDisabilityCount=0&outboundPcaCount=0&inboundPcaCount=0&promotionCode=&withReturn=0). Wait, sales posts are allowed here now?  I got a bridge I'm trying to get rid of. I've never seen the prices as low as $1.  Most of the time I end up spending <$10 but the longer you wait to buy your ticket the higher the price.
Megabus is crowded and not super comfortable but the price makes up for it.
 Can I bring my bike? Can we get this removed for self-promotion?

the guy just linked to a random 250 word article written by OP on some random site I've never heard of.   What a joke. The fares are never that low and you have to pay a service fee even though you can only purchase online. I've ridden 7 times and always hoping it gets better. Only once has it arrived on time at my destination, and four times it has departed 15+ minutes late from my departure location. Half the time it is packed - and the seats are as narrow as anything you would find on Southwest. Frankly, I would recommend the Capitol Corridor to/from SF any day over the MegaCrapper. The trip by train takes the same amount of time, offers more departure times, has much larger seats, has an on board cafe, huge restrooms (to accommodate wheel chairs), and best of all...conductors that will tell inconsiderate idiots that they can't play music on their phone speakers like they do on the bus!

Edit: Should add that MegaCrapper's "customer service" is EXTREMELY limited -- as in, 8-5 Mon. -Fri. So if the bus doesn't arrive or the stop location changes between your reservation date and travel date you may never know and have no way of finding out. In other words, don't rely on this service to get you somewhere when it's truly important. Yes, I've clearly been burnt by this company several times... This:

>You can travel to the Bay Area or Sparks, NV from Sacramento for as little as $1.

tells me you're spamming us. Anyone who has ever looked into megabus knows this is deceptive. Your 'ticket' may [rarely] be $1, but there are an additional $20 in fees each way.

It's one of the cheapest ways to get to the city, and does get you right to AT&T park for giants games, but they often arrive 1 hr+ later than they're "scheduled", they're really crowded, not well air conditioned, and the wifi is spotty. 

All in all, it's the cheapest way I've found. But anyone who can afford another option should probably just take the other option. I went to SF multiple times for only $1 before...this was before it got popular though.  Back when the station was on Front St and there was no sign indicating where the bus was supposed to stop :') I thought it was comfortable but I agree that it's crowded!
 Our mods suck.  I'll tell you this, everyone on here might hate my on the regular, but if I was a mod, I would take it seriously, and would always be on here.  I'd probably try to get more activity going like I was thinking about with the "what happened to you this weekend/what's coming up next weekend" thread I'm thinking about starting on the regular.  I just don't want to start something that everyone will hate just because it's me. Woah really?  I've had only good experiences with megabus....my bus usually arrives on time give or take 15 minutes and barring unusual circumstances.  They even account for SF traffic on the return trip to Sac during rush hour...

As for it being crowded, what do you want them to do about it?  


Can't speak of air conditioning being bad because when I went in the summer, I was fine..but the wifi is pretty bad. Yeah, while I've never gotten one for 1$ before, having a girlfriend in LA has made me well acquainted with them. I prefer them to Greyhound, comfortwise, but they don't go straight to where I need to go. They DO always stop at the same places though so at least they are regular. Don't know where you got your information.  I made a trip to SF for $1.50 to and $3.50 back home. No extra fees aa you claim. Yeah I have noticed the prices rising over time.
I think about $4 was the cheapest I ever got and that was at the old town station.  Maybe crowded was the wrong word. What I meant was you're not *given* much space. Constricted maybe? What I mean is, I sat next to a stranger, and despite being as far into the aisle as I could, we still had **way** too much contact.
