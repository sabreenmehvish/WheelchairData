Settlement coming in corner compliance case  Now if only we could make sidewalks ADA compliant by removing tents that take up over half of them. Maybe we could get some sidewalks out on the east side too I've seen quite a few of these go into corners in industrial NW so far this year. I've also never seen anyone in a wheelchair or rascal going down those sidewalks. I agree!  I was running the other day and had to swerve out into the street on the other side of a row of parallel parked cars, because there was a homeless camp with multiple 8x8 canopy tents blocking the whole sidewalk.  They built sides to it too.   My first thought was this blocks wheelchair use on this block.  Could i call in an ADA complaint to the city?
