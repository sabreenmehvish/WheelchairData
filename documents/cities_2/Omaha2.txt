After 3 years of trying to get one, last night a wheelchair accessible van was donated to me...I still can't believe this is real life. Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/Xgj2u

I've tried for so long and so hard...these are my attempts.

with countless people tweeting about it like boogie2988...

Someone my friend contacted after seeing these attempts just up and donated a van...He's an incredible guy. He wants to stay completely anonymous. No recognition. No attention. Just an amazing act of altruism to a complete stranger. I still can't believe it's real...

For it to finally be completed is incredible...

Sorry about the 3rd link being invalid! It was a paypal donation form. For anyone that did previously donate, thank you so much. Plates, registration and insurance are taken care of because of it :) I can't believe no one has commented on this yet, congrats dude! That is fucking awesome! Congrats!  You deserve it! Congrats! I'm so happy for you! That's incredible- congrats! <3 That is amazing, very happy for you!   ..or is this just fantasy? No one had commented on it because it was stuck in the spam filter, probably because of the gofundme and indiegogo links. Reddit tends to stick those in spam filters. Thanks man :) It hit the front page through r/pics yesterday. It's been a long and difficult process but I never expected anything near this. It's incredible  Hopefully he doesn't get his van stuck in a landslide. Thank you for getting it out :)
