Wheelchair Accessible Nightlife? Hi there, I tried searching for if anyone had previously asked this question, but didn't get any results. My fiance uses a wheelchair and I was hoping we could also check out some strip clubs or normal clubs. I've lived in NYC and we live in Seattle now, and I've found a lot of clubs require stairs to enter, or aren't very accessible so I was wondering if anyone can think of some that don't require stairs to get around in (it's fine if the VIP area has stairs we don't really need that).

Greedy edit:Also looking for Spas/massage recommendations that might have some accessible facilities if you know of any! I tried searching but only found one that mentions accessibility explicitly You're not going to run into problems at any casino clubs or any of the big stripclubs. Vegas tourism is very disability friendly. In fact people rent motorized scooters just to get around the giant casinos and the strip. The Commonwealth on Fremont street downtown  doesn't have wheelchair access to the rooftop patio. I was kinda suprised they didn't add an elevator when they gutted the old place and added the patio.   [deleted] Everything on the strip has wheelchair accessibility. Source: local standing inside strip casino Cool! I was having a difficult time finding any info on the nightlife side since most of the accessiblity tourism articles were targetted to a more family-friendly Thanks! I'll take note of that :)! We've never been. yes I know hakkasan does Haha thanks. I just read some reviews and it said that ceasers wasn't that accessible because of all the stairs there's supposedly a lot of ramps and lifts (lifts get kind of annoying and ramps can be difficult) so I figured I'd ask to get some maybe, not just technically accessible but perhaps more easy to manuever?
