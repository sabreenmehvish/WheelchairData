Who is the "Stop Soul Execution Please" Lady? I was going through some old pictures of mine and found [this one](http://i.imgur.com/Kx5p21X.jpg) from September 7, 2014. There's a lady in a wheelchair in front of the White House with a sign that says "Stop Soul Execution Please." I'm really curious about it because it's probably one of the more inexplicable protest signs I've ever seen. She's also been coming there for at least [a](http://instawhitehouse.com/2015/11/28/silent-protester-at-the-white-house-yesterday-stop-soul-execution-please/) [few](https://www.instagram.com/p/tBwif_S2KP/) [years](https://www.instagram.com/p/-H8Fg2rdPL/) [now](https://www.foap.com/photos/20259120-7ca2-4106-827b-6b5521d6eb04).

I know Lafayette Square gets more than its fair share of crazies that no one knows, but I was wondering if anyone might know this woman or what her sign means. A Christian view of why abortion may, or may not, be wrong? Is there someone named Soul on death row somewhere? Is there a denomination which believes your killing the soul by abortion? Let me consult with my chicken bones and get back to you...
