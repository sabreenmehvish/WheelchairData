Does anybody know a company that does non-emergency medical transportation with wheelchair lifts, like a van? I need to get my mom to the doctor tomorrow and I'm having a hard time trying to arrange transport. My wife works at Vandy and suggested Caliber Care and Transport. 615 224 8457.

Edit: There is also MTA Access Ride and I know the cab companies in town have wheelchair accessible vans. Have you called the MD's office? Generally they'll have a recommendation.  Thanks a bunch!  I'll give them a call! AccessRide isn't something you can get access to on short notice--  there are in-person interviews and a functional assessment required before one can use the service.

There's a list of cab companies [on Metro's website here](http://www.nashville.gov/Transportation-Licensing-Commission/Taxi-Companies.aspx); the starred companies have wheelchair-accessible cabs.  Or you can go with a medical transport company like Caliber, Tennessee Transport, or First Call if she has more specialized needs (not recommending any of them specifically; those are just a few I found via Google).  Expect those to be expensive. Yeah, unfortunately they didn't know of anyone.
