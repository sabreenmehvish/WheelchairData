Wheelchair-using woman sues Pittsburgh Parking Authority over too-tall meters  So when is Post Gazette going to use people first language. How the hell was the PA so oblivious when installing these things not to get them ADA approved? And do they even need to be if there are no handicapped spots on that street. Every other city I've been to only has lower meters next to handicapped spots.  I'm always amazed at the ways a city can think the ADA is optional, or something they can skirt around.

I recently tried using some of the kerb cuts downtown and nearly fell over, because they're so steep.   I love Pittsburgh, but sometimes this place is nuts. Dont the handicapped get placards so they can park for free?  
 I hope she looses. I the multi space meters are the perfect height for me.  For those who have no idea what people first language is:

The basic idea is to impose a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example "people with disabilities" rather than "disabled people", in order to emphasize that "they are people first". Because English syntax normally places adjectives before nouns, it becomes necessary to insert relative clauses, replacing, e.g., "asthmatic person" with "a person who has asthma." Furthermore, the use of to be is deprecated in favor of using to have.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language The ADA takes the view that over time, everything needs to become handicapped-accessible.  We don't have to do it all at once, but we have to make incremental progress.  So their view of these meters would be: there may not be any handicapped spots right *now*, but there obviously needs to be someday.  So as long as we're building new meters, we need to make them compliant so that when the handicapped spots are put in, the meters will be ready.

The same logic gets applied to bathrooms in public buildings: they have to be wheelchair accessible, even if the front door is not.  It seems weird, but the philosophy is that someday, the front door needs to be repaired too.

>__People-first language__ is a form of [linguistic prescriptivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescriptivism) in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), aiming to avoid perceived and subconscious [dehumanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization) when discussing people with [disabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabilities), as such forming an aspect of [disability etiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_etiquette).

>The basic idea is to impose a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example "people with disabilities" rather than "disabled people", in order to emphasize that "they are people first". Because English syntax normally places adjectives before nouns, it becomes necessary to insert relative clauses, replacing, e.g., "asthmatic person" with "a person who has asthma." Furthermore, the use of [*to be* is deprecated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime) in favor of using *to have*.

>The speaker is thus expected to internalize the idea of a disability as a secondary attribute, not a characteristic of a person's identity. Critics of this rationale point out that separating the "person" from the "trait" implies that the trait is inherently bad or "less than", and thus dehumanizes people with disabilities.

>The term *[people-first language](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/people-first_language)* first appears in 1988 as recommended by [advocacy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group) in the United States.  The usage has been widely adopted by speech-language pathologists and researchers, with 'person who stutters' (PWS) replacing 'stutterer.'

So that in case one day it is no longer a drive thru it is still ok. But doesn't ADA compliant apply to all new construction? If you renovate your bathroom, you need to ensure it is ADA compliant. If you renovate your lobby, you need to ensure it is ADA compliant.  So I just used these meters for the first time in a while today and noticed something. There is a series of buttons at the very bottom with a handicapped symbol next to them. Seems like you can use them without even looking at the screen.  So clearly there was some thought put in to comply with ADA. I tried looking on their website to see if there was more information about this but there is not.  No. That's not why drive-up ATMs have braille. Google it. :)
