Does anyone know anything about the homeless guy (wheelchair bound?) that hangs around Washington and State? He's usually drawing superheroes and similar things. I've given him breakfast and water a few times and just wanted to know if anyone knows anything about him. Some of the drawings he has are actually pretty cool (I'd probably buy one) but I can't tell if they're actually done by him. Seems like a genuinely nice dude. Not to sound flip, but if you've already given him water and breakfast and like what he does ... maybe talk to him? Oh I just haven't seen him for awhile. It's been maybe a few weeks since I've seen him, so I'm not sure if he found a new place or what.  Ah, got it.
