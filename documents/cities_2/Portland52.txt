Anyone have a wheelchair they would be willing to loan for two weeks? Long story short, a good friend of mine has had a really rough month. After two accidents, he has very little upper body strength and cannot walk. He is so bad off that he can't even use crutches, so currently his mobility is *extremely* limited. I am hoping that there's a kind redditor out there who has a wheelchair they're not currently using, and would be willing to let him borrow it for about two weeks. At that point the hospital says he should be healed enough to use crutches.

Like I said, he doesn't have much in the way of upper body strength and can barely move his right arm, so bonus points if the wheelchair is motorized.

Thanks in advance, fellow Portland redditors. I do not own one, but i saw a few at the Milwaukie bins (Goodwill outlet) last Saturday.  St Vincent de Paul social services might be able to help you find a wheelchair. They're on Milwaukie ave several blocks south of Holgate. Give them a call.
