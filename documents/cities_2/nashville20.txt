A Quick Question About The Patterson House? Does anyone know if it's wheelchair accessible or not? Thanks! I know the front door isn't. Or wasn't the last time I was there.  It's on the bottom floor.

Unless the house it is in got it some sort of variance, wouldn't it need to be ada compliant based on the fact that its not an old business? I haven't been in a long time but there used to be a ramp out back through the patio area. It is. The one spot parking lot to the right of the entrance leads to their patio, which has a ramp going directly into the bar.  [deleted] Their back door has a ramp.
