Woman In Wheelchair Says MTA Driver Strapped Her Into Bus Against Her Will: Gothamist  When I saw the title I felt like I'd really empathize and feel sorry for  this disabled person. Boy was I wrong.

So she refused to adhere to the rules she clearly knew about, and is crying that she's been mistreated? 

Even throwing words like misogynist...

I bet if there was an accident and she got hurt, she'd be the first crying for not being strapped and getting injured. if the straps don't fit, you must acquit! Ok so remove the straps and any liability that arises from them.  If she doesn't want to be strapped in, she shouldn't take the bus. I don't want a wheelchair flying into me on the bus.  I'm sure there are problems with the current MTA straps, but, yea.

Rules are rules, yo.
