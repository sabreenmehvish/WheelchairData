It's more billboard than seat, and a hearty fuck you to (outer SE) TriMet riders  Man, I am so tired from work - oh look a bench to rest on...God damn it!

Seriously, a rain cover would be more useful than that nonsense. They're not just installing these in outer SE. [They're called "leaners" and they're used in places where the the sidewalk isn't wide enough to allow a regular bench.](http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2014/05/joseph_rose_trimets_replaces_b.html) ADA compliance is a big deal. Dude, Synth Fest? What's going on here? [deleted] you see how huge that sidewalk is? I call bullshit.  From the article linked: "Roberta Altstadt, a TriMet spokeswoman, said the agencyâ€™s traditional benches violated the Americans with Disabilities Act at many locations."

How many benches violated the ADA, a sharp reporter would ask. Yup, it still seems like a BS excuse trading more ad space for rider convenience.   Sorry! Still newish to Reddit, and that was the wrong photo obviously.  http://imgur.com/gP7B6UD,ThdMDW1#1 [deleted] Congratulations on the douchiest post ever. Okay, tell me, what are the ADA specifications? Is it so a standard wheelchair can get past? What about a power chair, are the dimensions the same? Does ADA want room for a wheelchair AND another person passing by? Oh good, it seems that you've read the article. Why not email Trimet and ask? [deleted] Booo... dude deleted his post suggesting folks just sit their happy asses on the ground.  [The minimum recommendation in this DOT guideline is 32" *at a point* and 36" *continuously*.]( http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/publications/sidewalks/chap4a.cfm "4.3.3 Width") When this "bench" is the only amenity on a wide sidewalk like that, it's pretty obvious it's been built to prevent loitering. fuck if I know. Around my city there are plenty of benches and the sidewalks are smaller than this one. All this crap your spewing off is bullshit. I'm not saying its a lie but its bullshit.  He was very pushy I know, but [TriMet had one guy who refused to have his questions go unanswered thrown in jail] (http://rantingsofatrimetbusdriver.blogspot.com/2013/10/lane-jensen-makes-willamette-week.html).  I'll email TriMet about it Tuesday.  I encourage you to reach out to Trimet with your concerns. So at least with this "leaner" the ADA excuse is BS. I'm glad that's cleared up.   Uh, sorry pal, I'm not Trimet and I'm not the Americans with Disabilities Act. Please chill the fuck out. You're not TriMet, but you're defending TriMet's decision that we think was made for BS reasons. 

I do appreciate your input, Mr. Hotdog.  I'm very calm. Its hard to communicate emotions over text replies. My swearing is more a casual joking tone. I wasnt trying to be hostile towards you.  > you're defending TriMet's decision

Not really, I'm pointing out that from what I've read, it wasn't up to Trimet. Believe whatever you want to. If a vast conspiracy theory floats your boat, please keep on floatin' Maybe it's bullshit, but it does sound unclear whether you're calling bullshit on the transit agency, or the redditor, although I eventually did realize your intention was calling out the agency.
