Wheelchair athletes/users of Kansas City, where do you go to train or exercise? Company I work for has equipment tailored to wheelchair users and is looking to donate it to a facility that would use it. They would like to get rid of the equipment by the end of this month, so it's a little short notice, but if you all post places on this thread, I can get the information to the right people and get this done!  Contact AbilityKC! 68’s Inside Sports has a regular wheelchair basketball league, if that’s helpful.  I pm’d you
