Recommend your couple's therapist. My partner and I are looking for a couple's counselor. Someone who is familiar with post-partum mood disorders is a plus. We also need a wheelchair-friendly office (ground-level entry or elevator). Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

ETA: North Seattle / Shoreline preferred.  Search on psychologytoday.com
