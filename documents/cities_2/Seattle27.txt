What can we do for this (homeless?) guy? I pass this man every day on my way to and from work, sitting in a wheelchair on 3rd and Union. He is always bundled up in coats no matter how hot it is, usually has his legs bandaged up and is always hunched over. Morning, noon and evening he is there, always head down as if sleeping. Most of the time he is in front of the post office but sometimes he's in front of Bartell's. I have no idea if he has a home or not but am assuming he doesn't. This past week when passing him twice we saw he had wet himself. Then a couple of times it smells like he has gone #2 in his pants. He is always alone and I have never even seen his face on account of him being hunched over.

Does anyone know who he is? I guess my real question is, is there a way to find out if he gets help or has someone to care for him/help him? I don't feel comfortable going up to him to try to talk to him but I feel so bad each day seeing him and wish there was a way to know for sure. Any ideas?  If he's hanging out outside a Bartells slumped over in a wheelchair smelling like he shit his pants, I'm gonna guess there's nobody caring for him. And there are 10 more like him on the next block. Your heart is in the right place, but you can't adopt him. Volunteer, donate, vote, write to your representatives, make appointments to sit in front of them, anything but handing out money. That is the biggest impact you'll be able to make for him or anyone else in his situation. If he's there that often (and I'm 90% sure I know who you mean) then the local aid offices and shelters are probably already aware of him. I've seen this guy right beside the post office. He looks to be in bad shape. Where are the social workers/social work students for downtown? Should they be the clearinghouse on helping people like this? As usual, I'm completely horrified by these responses here. I partially agree with /u/TommyShinebox and his suggestions for how this could be addressed at a broader level. Here is what I would do: I would approach him with a friend I trust and ask him if there is someone I could call for him. Maybe he has family that is not aware of his current state. I would also give him some food. Maybe just some granola bars. Everyone says there's nothing you can do for him, but giving one meal to someone who probably hasn't eaten in a while isn't *nothing.* Then I would just start calling non profits and explaining what you see to them. They have a much better understanding of the resources available. Maybe there are benefits he could qualify for if he only applied. Either way, you'll know "what could be done" for him. I am glad your heart is in the right place OP. There is a difference between trying to "adopt" someone and trying to help your fellow man. Don't listen to people who are trying to convolute the second with the first. There is nothing you can do for him. 

If you give him cash it won't make a difference. If you call 911 it won't make a difference. You don't have the resources to put your life on hold and take care of this person. Odds are this man will continue to do this until he either dies or seeks services. 

What is in your control is how you handle it. You could talk to him and try to be friends. You could ignore him and walk past every day like everyone else. You could change your routine to walk a different way, but then you would just see another homeless person and be back at square one.  Talk to him, that's all, say hello and ask how he's doing. When asked of Mother Theresa what the most horrible affliction she had seen, she said loneliness was the hardest to bear and witness.  If this man really moves you I would suggest volunteering with one of the many programs that works with Seattle's homeless population. You need to talk to this guy. You may not be able to immediately do anything about his physical situation. Say hi to him. See if you can get him talking. Go from there.  Not trying to be mean because you do seem like a good person but why don't you feel comfortable going up and talking to him?   What to do depends. What part of the midwest did you move here from?  Send him back to the gutter! Yeah that is a good point that they are likely already aware of him. 3rs Ave is so crowded with homeless/drug users that I normally just live and let live but seeing this guy like this every day really makes me sad. Like there is this other lady who is always downtown outside my work (I'm in Century Sq building) and she looks like your typical meth user but she has a little red headed boy of about 2 in a stroller. I've been seeing them around for the past year and my heart always breaks for him, especially because I have a daughter around the same age. I just can't imagine the instability this boy goes through being outside day in and day out while his mom begs for money and does who knows what. But I did mention to a cop once who told me they're aware of these people but not much they can do. And he looks well fed and always has shoes, clothes, diapers etc so I have to tell myself he's probably okay.  That's what I'm wondering. For all I know, they (whoever they are) make welfare checks on him all the time. I almost want to just make sure that someone is helping him, I guess.  > Where are the social workers/social work students for downtown? Should they be the clearinghouse on helping people like this?

Lol what? Since Reagan, there's not a damned thing to do if he's unwilling to be helped. 

There are so many mentally challenged people in the streets, it breaks my heart. Most of them are receiving benefits from the state. And then preyed on by the otherwise clever drug addicts. Knowing they have funds, they'll turn them on, and tell them they know where to get more. Then they take the bulk of what they got, and give a little to the victim, just to keep them roped in. It's pretty sick out there; and sad. Well that's the thing, he's not asking for money. He doesn't even interact with anyone or look up. I think that's what sets him apart from other homeless people is that he's literally doing nothing all day but sitting slumped over.  Totally fair question. I guess if he seemed aware and awake and looking around, I would be able to assess his situation and state of mind/health. I might approach him but as it is since he always has his head down, for all I know he's sleeping. And because I don't know his mental state I am more cautious.  Hehe, not from mw.  To be honest, I'm pretty cynical about our current homeless/drug use problem downtown. But this guy just gets to me. He's not begging, yelling, shilling stolen merch, buying/selling drugs. He's just sitting day in and day out, head down, soiling himself. Just makes me sad. I won't downvote you, because because ignoring homeless people isn't any better.  if you see a clear meth-head with a little kid who is panhandling doesn’t hurt to call child protective services just to be safe. if your mom is on meth, she’ll go a long way to get her fix, even at your expense.  Whose job is it to perform welfare checks on folks downtown? When exactly did Reagan “close all the mental health facilities?”

Turns out, this is a huge myth that liberals have been high-fiving themselves over for decades.

In 1967, the California legislature passed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS), which allowed local, private (i.e., non-state) mental facilities to accept more patients—particularly those with more treatable or milder forms of mental illness.

Governor Reagan signed the bill into law; in his view, this was a win-win: mental health patients would receive treatments, and in turn the funding to state mental facilities could be reduced. Of course, the state facilities cried foul at the cut in funding, even though in theory they were not being under-funded. Of course, with a lower case load, treatments improved; however, some facilities reduced headcount.

Despite the bipartisan plan, unforeseen consequences developed. Without a requirement that all mental health patients go to public facilities, many borderline individuals simply refused private treatment as was their right. The upshot was that many individuals who could have benefited from treatment simply did not get any at all; they wound up as functioning members of the public. And sometimes, problems occurred.

Later, the Carter administration signed into law the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which largely promoted the same idea for national facilities. In 1981, when both parties in Congress agreed to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, President Reagan signed that into law. One of it many provisions was to eliminate federal funding for community services and thereby transfer funding back to individual funding or state-funded efforts. Had Reagan even been aware of that part of the Act, he would have immediately realized the Act was negating the disastrous effects of the LPS he experienced as governor of California.

In other words, the State needs more funding control over mental health facilities, whether local, community, or state. Serious cases could still be funded through Medicaid, creating a virtual federal funding pool of money. This was formalized in the Mental Health Planning Act of 1986.

In effect, bipartisan policies recommended that the Federal government transfer government funding of community mental health facilities back to the states. State-funded facilities as well as privately-funded facilities were not affected by that policy. Reagan signed the bill into law as part of an overall spending cut package. As he would have known, complete state funding of facilities resulted in terrible mental healthcare, but state governments had an obligation to provide for this. However, in 1986, he also signed into a law another bipartisan solution to have Medicaid assist with funding. The laws closed not a single facility.

Ergo, to the liberals, REAGAN CLOSED THE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES. The fact that states closed some facilities and let staff go at others due to their own budget issues is unimportant because, of course, liberals hated Reagan. And still do.

So the Newtown shooter, born around 1992, exhibited some sort of spectrum disorder; possibly, some who knew him suggest, Asperger’s. This syndrome is not associated with violence at all, and it wasn’t until after 2010 that the symptoms became obvious enough that his mother considered mental treatment for her son. To what degree she sought help is unknown, but it would have been covered under insurance. Under mental health guidelines, there really were no grounds to place the boy into a treatment facility. Had she done so, there would have been means to pay for it.

And then he did what he did in Newtown, and liberals managed to find a way to blame guns— disproved, since we now know how he obtained them and that nothing would have prevented this—and Reagan.

So when you hear the argument that Reagan closed the mental health facilities, ask the name of one health facility that Reagan actually closed. And when it closed. And how he closed it. And if you hear that Reagan closed it by extenuation of a funding cut, ask which particular bill he signed into law specified that particular facility be closed.

Or is it a case that bipartisan governments at the state and federal levels attempted to improve healthcare treatment and that bipartisan governments within the states screwed things up so badly that individual departments of health closed down less effective facilities? You will have lost the typical liberal at the word bipartisan.

Since Reagan, there's not a damned thing to do if he's unwilling to be helped.

There are so many mentally challenged people in the streets, it breaks my heart. Most of them are receiving benefits from the state. And then preyed on by the otherwise clever drug addicts. Knowing they have funds, they'll turn them on, and tell them they know where to get more. Then they take the bulk of what they got, and give a little to the victim, just to keep them roped in. It's pretty sick out there; and sad What you can do about it is live your life and let others do the same. Then he will either die or get services. There really isn't a whole lot to be done unless you have resources to burn here.  Yes, this is true. I don't fuck with homeless in pioneer square. But downtown, a maybe  Yeah, I understand, not even a sign. I guess living downtown for so long, I have calluses. I know this person wouldn't be there, day in and day out, and survive if they aren't either being taken care of by reach out teams or this is the game. 

I remember someone similar who I once saw talking on a wireless phone, then when I brought it up with coworkers they mentioned seeing the person get on a bus at 6pm, arrive at a park-and-ride, and get into a tricked out van for people with mobility issues. 

I'm just not sure what I'm looking at, and one reason is if that same person is there every day, all day, but not at night.  Is it the job of social work students? *Over 30 years ago, when Reagan was elected President in 1980, he discarded a law proposed by his predecessor that would have continued funding federal community mental health centers. This basically eliminated services for people struggling with mental illness.*

*He made similar decisions while he was the governor of California, releasing more than half of the state’s mental hospital patients and passing a law that abolished involuntary hospitalization of people struggling with mental illness. This started a national trend of de-institutionalization.*

 First, I never claimed he closed any mental health institutions. 

Second, I remember him saying on television something to the effect of *if they can get up in the morning, get dressed, brush thier teeth, then they don't need our help.* I also remember people being kicked out of the institution just because the insurance ran out. People, in spite of the criteria, couldn't take care of themselves. Oh sure, have a good day, and your out of here. Most of them ended up missing,; homeless, dead, who knows. But at least one I knew personally, went out and broke into the home of a local store owner, and repeatedly stabbed his wife. I also knew that family.

Whether Reagan knew what he was signing or not, is irrelevant. It happened on his watch, and is still felt today.


[Ronald Reagan's shameful legacy...

](https://www.salon.com/2013/09/29/ronald_reagans_shameful_legacy_violence_the_homeless_mental_illness/)

[Mental Health Systems Act 1980 - wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health_Systems_Act_of_1980) It's truly remarkable that the Republican line of thinking can show a person another human being who is unconscious, defecating all over themselves and their only response is to scoff and say *Well they're not helping themselves.* To be clear, this is not a normal human reaction at all. It is **LEARNED BEHAVIOR** from the political party of no empathy. Why you’re getting downvoted, is fucking insanity.

calm your fucking cognitive bias Seattle. Blah blah Reagan "starved the beast" and the expected and intended consequences occurred when funding dried up and involuntarily commitment was banned blah blah. Blah.  I dunno. Me, I try to be helpful, usually by offering to buy them a burger, or a bottle of water, or something. I have yet to be turned down or told they only want money, and that's in 15+ years of doing this. Actually, I have yet to have one who wasn't vocally grateful.

The guy OP is talking about, though? If I see him, I'd probably call one of the city services, but he may need help I, or OP, can't put in motion. > I remember someone similar who I once saw talking on a wireless phone

It should be noted that many homeless who want to get a job have a cheap phone, for the reason that they need a contact number. Yes, sometimes it could be a sign that "homelessness" is a money game, but other times it's a sign that the person is trying to get back into life. It all depends on the situation, and yes, in your case, the guy might've been just playing the game. More their job than mine. I'm trained in construction and accounting, not much on how to go about helping someone like this. What do social work students even learn about? At some point, the grad students would work in the actual field (Seattle) one would think. I wasn't asking you, by the way. If we can afford to house and educate illegals from across the planet, we damn sure can scrape up enough funding to institutionalize the seriosuly mentally ill (which I suspect we do to some extent currently). If we did that though, the constant protesters (if you're not one yourself you know damn well who I'm talkin' about) who tend to vote anti-Reaganish, would have screams and fits and break shit about themselves and their freinds being "incarcerated illegally" at the very same institutions we're discussing here, and now.

^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^207317 When you say "Since Reagan, there's not a damned thing to do if he's unwilling to be helped." you make it sound like he's solely responsible for it, which is **ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT**. Reagan was governor of California in 1967 and president of the US between 1980 and 1988. Can you clarify a specific year when "it happened on his watch"? Was it the 1960s or the 1980s? So you're saying this man, who sits in the same wheelchair parked in the same spot in the middle of the sidewalk in downtown Seattle, is surrounded by Republicans? You'd think at least one Democrat/non-Republican/Socialist would pass by the man so they can put their money where their mouth is and give some empathy to help this one very needy man, at least once. Nope, just Republicans downtown. All day, everyday. Yeah, that's it comrade. Too bad Clinton, both Bushes and Obama didn't have 28 years to undo any damage Reagan himself was responsible for Thanks bot Ok. Since the Regan administration then. Reagan was the president of the United States when I heard him say what he did. It was in the 80's. I was in college preparing for a career in the medical field. 

When the incident I described above happened, the families, on both sides, wanted to know why they let him out.

He was medicated on the inside at a nurses station, and did ok there; but when they released him, he stopped taking his medication, and his mental health deteriorated.

It's their insurance runs out, and there's not enough funding to keep them and they *seem*  to be doing ok, then they turn them out.

The Mental Health Systems Act provided Federal funding to mental institutions; Reagan repealed that act. Did I say that? No. I said what you're expressing is the Republican line of thinking. It is not normal. Medical field? I hate to admit it but ~~whoever~~ the administration who said "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor" lied to us. Oh then, you do admit this guy is surrounded by Democrats and Democrat lines of thinking since Seattleites vote over 2/3 Democrat, right? No lol. Even though this country operates on a political bionary system, most people don’t identify with either. It sounds like it is difficult for you to get beyond black and white thinking, but I encourage you to try. Here it is folks, right here ^ . Exactly where the mental gymnastics came out to spin bullshit and tell us that cold is hot and up is really down if you think about it for long enough.

Let me guess, you minored in English and went to grad school for Gender Non-Specific Political Studies?

---------------------------------------------

No lol. Even though this country operates on a political bionary system, most people don’t identify with either. It sounds like it is difficult for you to get beyond black and white thinking, but I encourage you to try. If it’s mental gymnastics for you to understand that the Republican Party tells people that someone defecating in their own wheelchair “refuses to get help” and to understand that most people don’t strictly identify with either major political party, then I don’t know what to tell you. What is your major? Philosophy?
