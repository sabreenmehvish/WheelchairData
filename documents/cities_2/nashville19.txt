Might be moving to your fine city, but I have a few questions Hey y'all!

I recently applied to a job for Davidson county so I've been looking for apartments. The complication I'm running into is I'm in a wheelchair, so that apartment has to be ADA compliant. This has been a major problem

Also, I don't drive so i use public transportation to get places. How is it there

Thanks! Welcome to r/Nashville! Unfortunately, the public transportation here is abysmal. We're working on it, but it likely will not be enough for your needs for a long time.  MTA is decent, monthly pass for handicapped is about 40 bucks.  Uber and Lyft are also prominent.  Can't recommend apartments but can tell you Nashville is a great city. serious question: aren't all apartments required to be ADA compliant? Check out The Lexington Apartments. It's west of Nashville. We lived there and I always saw the Access-a-ride (not sure if that's the name) picking up my neighbor and his wife who one was blind and one was in a wheelchair. Nice, quiet place. Could be a little expensive for what you're looking for but it was significantly less than being downtown.  Luckily I just looked into paratransit, which is better ADA does not apply to residential buildings. Amenities and offices in residential areas still have to be compliant, but the actual apartment buildings themselves do not.
