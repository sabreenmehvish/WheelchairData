Here's the security cam footage of the woman trying to ride her motorized wheelchair up the MBTA escalator.  I'm glad Darwin can't be arrested for assault. Um.....ok.... [deleted] good on that guy in the red, though, and the transit person for reacting quick. My first thought when I read it in the paper (I'm saying paper so people don't know I read the metro every morning) was there has to be a video of this I can laugh at. I guess it is kind of common to go up escalators in wheel chairs by holding the handrails: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z5S2xFdRsE&feature=related

Probably doesn't work so hot in a motorized scooter, though. He could have really hurt someone if he slipped and fell backwards. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdpvjIF6tMQ I don't think it's funny but if he fell earlier he could of set off a pretty large chain reaction hitting the other wheel chaired civilian and knocking down the woman standing in front of both of them
