New set up for the mfl.  What are we looking at here? Now how am I suppose to charge my phone? Like [this](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/in-transit/SEPTA-seeks-to-take-a-stand-on-subway-seating.html)? They started piloting this a few months ago, I'm hoping it becomes standard soon. Still, it's just a bandaid fix instead of a better, more permanent solution such as changing most of the seats to face each other like on the Broad Street Line.  Is that where I put my bike? Had a potato for the tripod. They took out a set of seats on one side if the mfl cars. Gives more standing room. A terrible photo of the (somewhat rare) wheelchair section of a MFL car. Backseat has an outlet on one side The train was nearly empty when I was on it. Does it help at all during rush hour?  Judging by the reflection in the window, it looks looks like the potato stuffed in your pants. Yeah, I don't think this is new. I've seen MFL cars with wheelchair sections for years. What do you mean by somewhat rare wheelchair sections? Every MFL car has a wheelchair section, where the flip-up single seat is.

This particular lay-out is new, but I don't know if it's for a wheelchair, specifically. If there are seats on the other side of the aisle it may not be maneuverable for a wheelchair.

The article linked above says it was seen used for bags & strollers, which is wonderful for getting strollers out of the way. Modestly mmmmmmmmmm mama likes herself sum *white* chocolate.

get innn 

**~~natty** What you've seen is the wheelchair section with the fold up seat by the door. The new set up has physically removed that seat and put in a handlebar. They were only put in last year so I don't think you've seen them for years.

>Last year the transportation agency began a pilot program, still ongoing, that removed two seats from each of six cars,
replacing the space with handlebars..

I mean the rare *dedicated* sections, not the "these seats flip up" section that appears twice on every car. I like all types of chocolate. But bol hung like a potato, that might look kinda weird. They aren't dedicated for wheelchairs. They are meant primarily for standees during rush hour. mmmmmm st patricks day cuming late dis year then. 

good thing mommas hungreeeeeeeeee**ee**

ruff Are you trying to start a pedantry fight? Because this is how you start a pedantry fight.

Next topic: *Bathrooms. Not just for baths!?* Whoa, I'm impressed with your knowledge of Celtic culture. Now I don't usually do this, but I got a friend who makes a mean shepherds pie. He's a really nice white guy in his 40s, specializing in clever conversation and sharing his opinion. He goes by redwoodser, and I think you two will really hit it off.
