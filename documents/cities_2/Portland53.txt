Roger A. Frank, PCC counselor in wheelchair reported missing  [](http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/10/body_of_missing_pcc_counselor.html#incart_river_default)

Unfortunately, they already found his body. Hope the poor bastard got one final lap dance. Oh, no. I gave him his last lap dance....not fucking joking. Just looked this up, and [it's true](http://www.kgw.com/video/yahoo-video/Portland-man-reported-missing-175421331.html). :( You got a heart o' gold, darlin'.

Also, keep downvoting, haters.  Maybe you'll hurt my feelings enough and I'll off myself in a strip club parking lot.
