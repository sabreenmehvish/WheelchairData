Best wheelchair accessible businesses for dining and drinking I have a friend coming to town who uses a wheelchair and I've noticed that a lot of hip spots in DC are in small, old buildings with limited wheelchair accessibility and overcrowded capacity. What are the best spots for dining and drinking comfortably in a fully accessible environment? I'm thinking about comfortable sidewalks, ramps, entrances, space between tables, sizable bathrooms, etc. I'm also thinking about good, creative, mid-range food and a strong beer menu. I like places like Toki Underground and Granville Moore, but I dont think that's going to work this time around. Especially looking for suggestions in the Northeast and Northwest quadrants. Thanks in advance! Capital City Brewing by metro center is always a hit. It shouldn't be a problem for accessibility. I'd still call ahead and get a seat. They brew their own and have a nice selection of other drinks. Food is somewhat upclassy pub food.  I have a friend in a wheelchair.

RFD (Regional Food And Drink) near Gallery Place-Chinatown is good for a sports bar with a HUGE selection of beer from all around the world. Meridian Pint.
