The Transit of Greater Portland Hey /r/portland! I've been working on a nerdy project illustrating diverse public transit networks around the continent, and of course I had to include your lovely city. Portland is quite known for its public transportation, it was an obvious choice for one of the first ones to do.

This isn't a comprehensive list of everything out there, more of a snapshot of the variety of public transportation rolling around the region. I tried to get all of the most recognizable stuff, but I'm not a local so please let me know if I missed any big ones!

**Check out how it turned out here: http://imgur.com/a/o8f5n**  
I've also included a sort of 'illustrated guide' to identifying them all.

You can also see how Portland compares to some of the other cities I've done on my project page below. I've done five cities so far, but more are coming!

(By the way, you can order [prints](https://society6.com/product/the-transit-of-greater-portland_print#1=45) and [mugs](https://society6.com/product/the-transit-of-greater-portland_mug#27=199) of these little illustrations online if you like them - the poster even includes every streetcar color out there!)
 Nice work!  If you wanted to, you could also include the new [type-5 MAX trains](http://trimet.org/newmax/), the [30 foot buses](http://news.trimet.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3400-1.jpg) and the [old Budd trains](http://www.railpictures.net/images/d1/1/1/9/1119.1292696357.jpg) that are used as back-ups for WES.   Don't forget about [Lift!](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8154/7563478624_5b5b262308_b.jpg) Sidebar photo? Sidebar photo. The Tillamook bus (the wave) has a route serving Portland to the coast and the Mt. Hood Express runs to timberline lodge, run by Sandy Transit Agency. Though not based in Portland metro, they are options to get out of town on transit. Also the coast starlight and one of the empire builder Amtrak routes start or stop in Portland.  Very nice. Note that the OHSU aerial system is officially known as the tram. Yes, gondola is more technically accurate. I guess somebody didn't want to get confused with the boat. Here is one that seems to fit here: http://www.columbiacountyrider.com/ This is awesome! Also: Bolt Bus? I love this! I have long thought about making a documentary about mass transit. Oh this is so wonderful! I want a print real bad! Awesome dude. Gonna buy one of these Super cool to include the SAM!! Are there articulated buses still in service anywhere? Riding in the back of those was always a thrill.  Super awesome.  My dad drives for trimet, so I ordered a mug for him Don't forget Empire builder Amtrak starts here and Seattle then heads east merging in Spokane. The color scheme is blue and grey. It's a pretty historic line to leave out.

Look for the Portland-Spokane run to get the right train cars.  SMART has a trolley that they roll out in the summer too. The only correction I can suggest is that the MAX type 1 cars are never used alone - they are ALWAYS paired with a type 2 or type 3 car, since they aren't disabled-accessible, they have to be paired with a car that is.  So showing two type 1 cars coupled together is inaccurate.

Long explanation: When the MAX system first started, only type 1 cars were in the system.  There were no low-floor cars.  So for wheelchair access, there were wheelchair lifts at each station, toward the front of the train.  The lifts were not automatic, the train driver had to get out and manually operate the lift for the boarding/deboarding passenger, then get back in.  There was only one lift per station (one each direction,) at the "front" of the station.  And the aisles in the trains are too narrow to reasonably accommodate a wheelchair, and there are only two wheelchair spots at each end of the train, so only two wheelchairs could be accommodated at a time.

Needless to say, this was both bad for those who needed to use them, but bad for on-time performance, as it took a couple minutes for the operator to run the lift.  Here is a photo of [a lift](http://gallery.transitq.com/v/trimet/dyftv2/3952059425_o.jpg.html), and one of [a lift in use](http://gallery.transitq.com/v/trimet/dyftv2/3952836828_o.jpg.html?g2_imageViewsIndex=1). Yes, that's the operator of the train out there running it.

When the MAX system expanded to the West of downtown, they bought the type 2 cars, which were low-floor with integrated/automatic gap-bridges - no operator effort necessary.  When the type 2 cars were introduced, they removed all the lifts from the stops, and assured that type 1 cars would always be used only with a type 2 car.

Sometimes, there will be single-car trains - they will always be a type 2, type 3, or type 4.  And type 4 cars are always paired only with other type 4 cars.  1, 2, and 3 are mix-and-matched.  (I imagine that the new type-5 would be mix-and-matchable with type 4, since they're a derivative of it, but I don't know for certain.)


And if you want to trigger some nostalgia, include the old Crown-Ikraus [articulated buses](http://d8lktyzx0qqvd.cloudfront.net/timelines/user494526/timeline472931/1433892246Crown-Ikarus_bus_of_Tri-Met,_Portland.jpg) (which originated what is now called the "old" color scheme) or the even older orange [AM General](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/1976_AM_General_bus,_TriMet_1091,_in_1984.jpg) buses. I have now seen a cherriots bus for the first time this week and I live in Salem... Mythical creatures they are Would the OHSU tram count? Otherwise amazing work! I can see some of the local civil engineering firms wanting to use this for marketing. You might also include the CAT (Canby Area Transit), very similar to the SAM.  No Nike Biketown!?!

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ [Pedi-cab](http://pdxpedicab.com/home/) from Waterfront to Providence Field if you're a sadist? Don't forget [YCAT!](http://www.yctransitarea.org/)

Probably bigger than SAM?  I'm not sure. Free bus to Chinook winds.  Ah - I was just about to mention both of those!   And seconded - your graphic is fantastic.  My train fanatic son wants one for his wall.  :)  Yep, need the Type-5 MAX and the old WES train! I got onto a bus the other day not realizing it was a 30 footer. That was an interesting surprise. Yes, please add a LIFT bus! LIFT paratransit serves all three counties. There's one of these sitting outside the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington. I always thought it was far away from home. Hey that'd be neat! I could provide a more sidebar-friendly format too, even. And The Central Oregon Breeze, too! The tram (not to be confused by [this](http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/fr/mulhouse/Mulhouse_Tram_BK3.jpg)) is technically not a [gondola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola_lift), as it's not continuous. It's technically a [cable car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_car), not to be confused with [this guy](http://www.sftodo.com/images/cable-car/cable-cars-san-francico.jpg) You should go for it! There's not much out there I've found as that's the kind of thing I like to watch.  Not in the Portland area, no. C-Tran is going to be getting some for the BRT line, and there's the possibility that the Powell-Division line will use them, but that hasn't been decided yet. And the Coast Starlight!  they stop running when it gets dark.  Me too! I got on and had to stand and as I looked back I realized all the middle front-facing seats were gone. I didn't even know we had 30 foot buses at the time, I was baffled Trimet has been auctioning a lot of the LIFT buses off lately, maybe Boeing bought it for a shuttle. We just had our latest sidebar photo contest, but I'll try to remember to ping you when the next one starts up. 300x300 is best, 300Wx400H can do. Well that's just confusing, ain't it! That's probably it. All the paint was tripped but you could easily tell it had been the bus in that LIFT picture; the TriMet logo was still visible. Absolutely! On top of that, tram can refer to MAX, streetcars or the aerial tram, depending on where you're from / terminology. Extra confusing if you ever host Europeans who want to ride "the tram."
