Wheelchair assistance in Los Angeles. Hi Los Angelenos, i am hoping that I can be pointed in the right direction. A friend of mines father had a stroke that left him paralyzed on his left side over a month ago. His Medicare A was discontinued and now his family is unable to have him go to therapy. I'll spare You the long details. The hospital told them that if they are able to get him a wheelchair that they will able to take him home (Karman Tilt-In-Space Folding Manual Wheelchair). Anyways, I'm not here asking for money but to see if you might know of companies that can donate wheelchair or have some financial assistance for families whose Medicare don't cover costs.  I agree with /u/jitatime to start by asking for the hospital social worker and requesting resources.

Below are some other places to start contacting for free or loanable wheelchairs.  I would recommend that your friend contact all of them just in case.

* [Convalescent Aid Society](https://www.convalescentaidsociety.com/items-for-loan-1.html)
* [Durable Medical Equipment Aid Society \(DME\)](http://www.thedme.org/eligibility)
* Large list of possible programs through [Ability Tools Exchange](http://abilitytools.org/services/reuse-programs.php#Los Angeles)
* [Wheels of Mercy](http://wheelsofmercy.org/contact-us)

The could also call the [National Council for Jewish Women LA](https://ncjwla.org/) to see if they have wheelchairs that have been recently donated.

There's also the [Ability Tools Exchange](https://exchange.abilitytools.org/items/ItemSearch.aspx?Search=&CategoryID=27&Sortby=DateDesc&State=CA&IncludeExpired=0) site where people can list medical items (include wheelchairs) for sale/free or make requests.

Good luck to your friend's family! What hospital. The Hospital should have a social worker who can point you in the right direction, talk to the case manager to have one talk to them. Their should be a discount med equipment store, near by. Otherwise only one I know of is in pasadena near the bestbuy.

I don't know of any charity programs off hand, but they probably exist...you could probably also get one loaned to you if you are just looking to break him out. Thank you LA+USC County Hospital.
