My mom got in an accident today and I'm looking for a witness.  This is a long shot, but my mom got in an accident today.  She stopped to let a person in a wheelchair cross the street, and was rear ended.  She didn't think of taking that person's name (bad idea, I know) so I'm trying to see if anyone knows this person. 

The accident happened Berryessay, San Jose.  Go to the location and look for businesses with security cameras.
