Looking for machinist shop with a drill press for drilling holes in steel piping I'm building a dog wheelchair for this boxer I pet sit with myleopathy, and I have everything I need except the holes in the piping for the wheels. I'm putting on old bike wheels, and it looks like I'll need 1/2" holes drilled into 3/4" piping, 1 hole every inch in case for comfort reasons I need to adjust the set up and put on bigger or smaller wheels, as well as for when the dog passes away, it's adjustable for the next critter that needs it. I'm having a helluva time finding a shop with a drill press that I can get this done at. Having the shop being in the west philly area a plus. [deleted] I have a drill in west philly you can use.  If you have some sort of vice and a steady hand I'm sure it would work. OMG YES!!!

After I get this done I'm posting an instructional on how to do this for other people. Is tomorrow good? yeah, that's why i'm looking for a shop with a drill press. I need multiple holes drilled, and I'd like them to be as precise as possible since they're for wheels. I might have luck, since it seems a guy who went to school with my brothers graduated from Thaddeus Steven's as a machinist and is employed as one, so I might be able to get a hand from him. There are a bunch of machine shops at Penn.  If you say it's for a good cause and ask nice they may let you in.
