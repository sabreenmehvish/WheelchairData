I'm visiting my mother and wheelchair-bound brother this week and my bro and I want to get out of the house tomorrow to give my mom a day off, where should we go to have fun Should mention I can't really drink since I'll be driving him and besides seeing deadpool, I'm not sure what to do tomorrow. Consider visiting the zoo if the weather is favorable. It offers handicap-accessible sober fun, plus kangaroo petting. I always recommend going to the Lane Motor Museum.  And its just one floor so easy on the wheelchair.  Cheap and good for an hour or two.

 The First is a nice stroll.  You picked a good weather day be outside.  5 Points.Sit in the window of 3 Crow Bar and get hammered!

as a matter of fact,I think I'll go to 3 Crow and get drunk! Great suggestion. I forget to tell people about this place when they are looking for different things to do around here
