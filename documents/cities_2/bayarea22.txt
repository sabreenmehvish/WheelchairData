Woman named Dica from East Bay. Met a (Caucasian) girl years ago at the UC Theater Rocky Horror PS in Berkeley.  She had the unusual name "Dica," which she said was "Acid" spelled backward (parents were hippies).  She used the last name "Taylor," but I don't think that was her legal last name.  Family lived  north of Berkeley (Albany?).  Mother was wheelchair-bound.  She would be approximately 37 today.  I know this is a very, very long shot, but I thought that there could not be too many Dicas around.  Anyone know someone who fits this description?  I have wondered for years what happened to her.  I no longer live in the Bay Area, hence my posting here.
