Assault charges dropped against U St. metro man in wheelchair  We should all contact out Representatives in Congre...oh wait... Pity the cops. It's going to be a lot harder to get bogus assault charges to stick when everyone is walking around with a cell phone camera. Funny, but I DID contact old Philly Mendelson. He oversees these idiots. While it would have been absurd to charge this man with assault, WHY THE FUCK AREN'T COPS BEING CHARGED!?

/rant It can also lead to rewarding ethical officers. They've been relegated to desk jockey status, pending a US attorney's investigation?
