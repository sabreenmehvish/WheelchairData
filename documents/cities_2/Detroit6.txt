Anyone interested in supporting a Disabled Veteran Hockey team in Detroit? I've been working on putting together a Disabled Veteran Hockey program in Detroit under a well established nonprofit organization.  Our biggest hurdle right now is just getting the word out there!  If anyone is interested in helping out to spread the word, just send me PM and we can talk further.  Thanks for the help! I am a freelance writer and can help you with a press release if you'd like. PM me if you're interested. :) A lot of active duty coast guard guys around here play drop in, a buddy of mine in the area also just went to the USCG hockey tournament. Get in touch with USCG sector detroit (Google for the number) and maybe they'll get involved. Staff there is around 100 and attached units add another 150 or so Have you tried talking to Michigan Sled Dogs or the Michigan Mustangs/WCHL? Thanks for the reply.  I skated with a few USCG guys at Joe Louis a few months ago, hopefully I can get a good in with them! I'm meeting with the Sled Dogs in a few weeks!   Yeah I realize Disabled has a pretty wide meaning and the guys have good upper body strength with no leg use I'd say go the way of sled hockey. I compete in the WCHL or Wheelchair Hockey League, which also gave rise the Michigan Mustangs Powerhockey team. We are a wheelchair league that plays floorhockey in a gym. We are mostly power-chair users but allow manual chairs with some stipulations but that's all kind of technical. Right now we have less than 5 manual chair players including myself out of 40 in the league.
