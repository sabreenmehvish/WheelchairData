Anyone know about the protest on 16th St mall this afternoon? I saw it happening, but I couldn't get close enough to hear what it was about. It looked like a bunch of folks in wheelchairs going down the westbound MallRide path chanting something. This is what you are looking for: https://adapt.org/press-advisory-40-year-adapt-anniversary-celebration-events-set-for-monday/ [deleted] Here's a link from one of their actions this week. https://adapt.org/press-release-national-adapt-confronts-senator-cory-gardner-for-refusing-to-cosponsor-the-disability-integration-act/ 
 I have worked with some of these guys and they are bad asses and their demands are painfully fair. Most people actually think that the rights they are fighting for are already given them but it's eye opening and tragic to hear that alot of basic human rights are not afforded them.  Why are they doing it again Tuesday, causing a public disturbance, impeding traffic AND pedestrian flow? I'm all for civil protest, but this is too much.  Sounds like a standard day outside the Denver Rescue Mission. My coworker told me it was a veterans protest.  There have also been boycotts outside cornerstone bakery lately. according to the link that /u/kmoonster provided, seems to be a little more serious than that.
