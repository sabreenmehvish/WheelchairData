VIDEO: Restaurant workers rescue man trapped in tipped over wheelchair, rising water  This breaks my heart. That man shouldn't have to navigate a flooding street alone. Our society is a failure. At least he was lucky those dudes were paying attention. stupid driving is not just relegated to cars [deleted] The dude has a wheel chair most likely paid for by tax payers, probably eats well on tax payers, and most likely has health insurance on tax payers. 

Yes it's horrible to watch a person be in such a terrible position, but Jesus Chris society is doing everything it can, it's only been in the last 50 years that poor paralyzed people even had a chance of mobility. Calling our society a failure because a wheel chair tipped over is ignorant. 


Edit: Notice the sidewalk is blocked, had it not been this person could have scooted on bye, think about your disabled fellow citizens don't block the side walks.  Stupid comments are really your bailiwick, though.  He's just lazy  /s Those are several assumptions you're making, and in my view, they are irrelevant.

Our society is not doing everything it can.  Other societies do more.  I reject the notion that since we recently made improvements that more improvements are not necessary or desirable. In my view your view is irrelevant, because of historical ignorance.
