A postcard photo of Vine @ Sunset  At first i was all "That's not at Sunset that's Franklin...." then I was like "ohhhh right right right, THAT sunset....' Very nice...did you take it? Top of the hill on Vine near the 101? Pretty damn rad, dude.   20 more years and we'll have a complete canyon.. My favorite club is right across the street from capital records!  I once pushed a homeless black person on a wheelchair across this intersection. We made it like half way, and then the light turned green and the oncoming traffic started to come towards the crosswalk. I tried to grab his wheelchair to stop him, but he objected and yelled and tried to continue crossing the street. I was kind of high and was thinking too much so I sort of froze. And then another guy grabbed the back of his chair and prevented him from crossing. Yep! Snapped it a few hours ago. LOL awesome
