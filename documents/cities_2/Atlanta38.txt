Coming to Atlanta for the Peach Bowl I'm a caretaker for a 26 year old dude with an insatiable appetite for beautiful women. He originally wanted to go to a strip club, but with his wheelchair and the challenges it causes, we might think about getting a stripper to come to the hotel. I was raised in Vegas, and getting a stripper is part of growing up in the 702. I have no idea how it works in other places. Anyone have any suggestions and/or advice? I know it's a wacky request, but if anyone can help,  it's reddit. Clermont Lounge https://atlantastripper.com/why-topshelf.html
