Murderball in San Diego The wheelchair rugby Pacific Sectionals will be held in Balboa Park this weekend. If you've ever seen *Murderball* or *Friday Night Lights* this is the same deal. A bunch of dudes (and a few gals) in wheelchairs beating the crap out of each other.

This tournament determines which of the West Coast teams will advance to the National Championships next month, so it's going to be some serious competition!

It's free and open to the public, we love spectators. It's at the Balboa Municipal Gym (next to the Air & Space Museum) on Friday 10:30-4:30, Saturday 10-4 and Sunday 9-2.
