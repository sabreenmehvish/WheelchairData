Taxpayers On The Hook For Undisclosed Settlement After SFPD Officers Allegedly Try To Shake Man From Wheelchair: SFist  Can't believe this jack wagon is getting one bloody cent! He drove his chair over to them to be a nuisance, was nuisance, didn't remove himself, then tried to back over the officer! They should have fined this pr*ck! Purely a reaction to him being in a wheelchair; manufactured outrage. "It was a video that shocked a city still reeling from a police shooting of a seemingly out-of-it man just weeks before: A San Francisco Police Department officer appearing to attempt to dump a quadriplegic man from his chair. And now we're all going to pay for that act, as the city is reportedly prepared to sign off on a settlement in that case for an as-yet undisclosed amount."

edit: he didn't try to back over the officer. How much does the POA pay you to troll reddit on SFPD's behalf? The anti-BART/Pro-housing/POA split the bill evenly ðŸ˜‚
