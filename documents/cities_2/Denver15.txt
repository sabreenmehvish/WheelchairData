Highlands Ranch Teen With Spina Bifida Has Custom Wheelchair Stolen Â« CBS Denver  What kind of person would do this?!? I hope they find him, break his legs, and then steal HIS Wheelchair. Douche. So sad.  Who would do this.  Please keep your eyes open for this family. I went to school with him, hope everything works out. I'm good friends with his sister and have met the kid before. They are, of course, very pissed off. The thief should be ashamed. Oh my god, what the fuck. I know this kid personally. I just went up to Greeley for college so I'm not there with him, but seriously FUCK whoever did this. I'm gonna give Pierce a call. Cripples gonna cripple :( That sounds like "frontier justice", and last time I checked this is still the frontier.
