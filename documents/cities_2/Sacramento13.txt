Missing person?: Jonah near 16th and Broadway I work near 16th and Broadway. The Police called every phone in our office to tell them if they see a guy named Jonah in a wheelchair with orange wheels and bumper sticker that reads "Jonah" on the wheelchair itself, to contact them. I guess he is missing or something. Other details, he has brown hair, and was last seen with blue shorts, no shoes and no shirt. 

So, if you see the guy, please contact the police. Unless you hate the police...Then just turn on your favorite NWA song and ignore this.  I JUST FUCKING SAW THIS GUY IN FRONT OF GOLDFIELDS LIKE AN HOUR AGO.

Edit: What number do I call?
Edit 2: Someone respond before 8pm otherwise I won't be able to do it!

Edit. He might still be around there. When I saw him he was just sitting still staring into the intersection literally right in front of the door to Goldfields on J  264-5471 Sac PD Any update here? Is it too late to call? Doesnt hurt to try I would. Can't hurt.

No update on their Twitter page.
