Need to borrow a wheelchair for a day Family is visiting me here in DC, we haven’t all been together since about 10 years ago, and first time mom is in DC. Would like to take mom with us to see the monuments but mom has severe disabilities and has been staying in the hotel to not burden her kids (me and my siblings). This might be the last time I have to spend with her before she passes and would love to rent a wheelchair to get her around with us but with tourist season being full force I don’t think I’m going to be able to swing it. Mainly want to walk her along the mall and maybe a few museums. If anyone has any suggestions on where to get a wheelchair or if you have one to borrow I would be forever grateful. Thanks in advance  Check with these folks—they have wheelchair rentals (and, not being a typical wheelchair rental place, might be more likely to have them in stock on short notice): http://bikeandrolldc.com/rentals/ Nearly all the Smithsonians have wheelchairs for check out (you leave your ID at the desk). FWIW, I don't think they would notice if you took it outside, as long as you return it at the end of the day.

I'm so sorry about her health issues. Hoping this visit is full of happy memories for you all. Grubbs Pharmacy
