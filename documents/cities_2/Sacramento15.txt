Cake Day! - I am a redditor/disabled athlete/coach check out our Sacramento-Based non profit for persons with disabilities Its my cake day so I am going to let you guys know about a non-profit that I work with here in town.  Its called T.I.E.S. (Teaming Individuals Emphasizing Sports).

We focus on providing a social/physical sports environment for those who are disabled, regardless of age/gender.  Right now we have a few programs going on.  Each year we hold an annual Up/Down tournament ( up/down tennis is where you play doubles and one person  is in a chair) and this year its in Manteca, CA.  We are going to have a Casino Night fundraising event the night before.

We also have just added a few new programs with regards to Wheelchair Basketball.  We now have 3 different levels of wheelchair bball here in town.  A Championship team, called the Sacramento Rollin Kings, a rec team callled the Sacramento Royals and we are just starting up a youth program for kids.

I have been on reddit for 4 years now, and I just felt that I wanted to share this with you all.

Oh and also since its my cake day, here is an obligatory of myself doing a handstand in my wheelchair.  I was showing off to a couple of other sports coaches.
