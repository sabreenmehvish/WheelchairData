What's to do that's wheelchair accessible and doesn't involve drinking? 

Currently wheelchair bound, and as a condition of my injuries I can't indulge in the fine craft beers Richmond has to offer. My family will be in town in two weeks and I can leave the hospital with them for the weekend. Any ideas? VMFA. Flying Squirrels. Fine Dining all over the city. Fishing lots of places. ummm... Murderball. The VMFA is always a hit with my out of town guests. It's very accessible. Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens is very accessible, too. High entrance fee, though. Hit the movies. I believe whoever goes with you gets a free ticket as your "companion" at Regal Cinemas.  Check out Belle Isle - nice scenery, interesting and the suspension bridge and island are wheelchair accessible http://www.hikingupward.com/ovh/belleisle/
 kayaking? Thanks for starting this thread. My parents are coming into town next weekend and I'm looking for things to do with them as well. We're thinking about doing the Patrick Henry reenactment thing at St. John's, since it's accessible (according to their website). Still looking for some other things to do though. can you get a dui in a wheelchair? Cinebistro/movies.. use those premium wheel chair spots.  Not sure what murderball is. Care to indulge some more info? VA sounds great. Thanks for the info.  dogwood dell is also wheelchair accessible I might hit the movies. After being bed bound for two weeks though I'm not too eager to sit in a movie for two hours.  I'll look into it. Thanks! I wish.  You probably can in chesterfield. Not sure, however at the hospital I make the joke that there's no speeding tickets in a wheelchair. I'm 22 so as the young one I wheel much faster than most wheelchair bound patients. Just learned how to do a wheelie today.  It's wheelchair rugby.  Ooh. Buurrn. How long have you been a ln easyrider?
