Anyone want to help a young disabled veteran out. A 39 year old veteran, confined to a wheelchair,who is asking a big favor. I’m staying at a hotel in white settlement. I came here to go to one of the best rehabilitation facilities in the Nation. What I didn’t realize when I booked this hotel,was that in the white settlement area there is a law where liquor cannot be delivered, and the only transportation that I have is my chair. I just want to have a celebratory drink and I cannot even have it delivered. I’m prepared to pay anyone a reasonable amount of money, Say $40 plus the cost of the bottle and share the bottle also looking for treesPm me if interested. I take care of people who take care of me.  Sounds like a dangerous request... [deleted] This don’t sound like alcoholism to me.
