Don't stop and ask questions in Central City if you see a man in a wheelchair ... he answers with bullets  "Hey, how'd you end up in that wheelchair?"

PEW PEW PEW That area of town does not have the best reputation. 

The guy probably thought he was getting ready to get robbed. (he may or maybe not be in the best mental state.) 

I know when I'm biking around or what not and someone tries to talk to me I mean quickly bike away. 

The other day I had an SUV pull out in front of me and slam on breaks on an empty road. I noped the fuck out of there and made the first turn I could to go the wrong way on a one way. (That way it would be obvious for them to keep following me + it was easier for my bike to go against traffic and then jump on the side walk than their car to go head on into other cars.) 

 "The M1 does my talking!!" - old WWII poster.  [he must've hit the fuel tank on the car](http://i.imgur.com/wqB8YtF.jpg) "Like this, motherfucker!" exact words from my granddad before he died and I was heading off on an around the world trip. 

"boy don't go starting wars and make me get my old M1 out. I retired that thing after Korea"
