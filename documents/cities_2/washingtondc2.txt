DC now has crews to clear bike lanes, wheelchair cuts after snow  Finally! It sucks parking in these spots when they're covered in snow.  >D.C. is doing something different this season when it comes to snow removal: There’s a new “non-motorized trail” work detail specifically assigned to clearing bike paths, bridge deck sidewalks and ramps compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act at intersections.

>To help accomplish that, the city purchased new equipment.

>“It’s still a little too wide to do all of the (city’s) bike lanes, but it looks pretty good to do many of them, those that aren’t hemmed in by cars like the cycle track,” said Mary Cheh, chair of D.C. Council’s Committee on Transportation and the Environment. >“It’s still a little too wide to do all of the (city’s) bike lanes, but it looks pretty good to do many of them, those that aren’t hemmed in by cars like the cycle track,” said Mary Cheh, chair of D.C.

I... don't understand this. If this equipment is still too wide to clear all of the bike lanes properly, wouldn't it be better to buy equipment that is the right size? 4th st NE between Lincoln and Michigan now please! Agreed, and it’s especially a tough situation for people with disabilities. My sister uses a wheelchair and winter, even a mild one, can be brutal for her since a lot of places do not clear snow away promptly and even a little bit of ice can make using a powered wheelchair almost impossible.  plates check out lol Totally. The curb cuts are always the most convenient places to park and I hate stepping out of my car into a pile of snow.  ... *bruh* No joke I'm surprised these things don't come with some winter treads if it is a powered unit, some kind of secondary outer wheel that can drop to the ground when outside and lift indoors. Need to get that on Sharktank. I never thought about wheelchair bound folks with the snow and curb cuts.
