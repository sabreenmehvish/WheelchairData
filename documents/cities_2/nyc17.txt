When a subway platform is a trap: In complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act, New York is far behind other large U.S. cities.  I couldn't even imagine living here if I was in a wheelchair, or even crutches. Cant seem to find a bigger version of this (the original 404'd), but for reference here is the wheelchair-accessible subway map http://www.gothamgazette.com/blogs/wonkster/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/nyc-subway-small.jpg

 Wouldn't this be attributable to the wide availability of busses which are easily wheelchair accessible? i don't understand how those elevators break all the time. took them like 2 years to build one at 71st Continental and it broke as soon as it was opened for use So when were behind other US cities they mean those cities which have **minuscule** public transportation networks in comparison to New York?

They mean New York the city with **more stations than any other mass transit network in the world**. 

Cities where the vast majority of transit is accomplished by car (New York is the **only** US city in which less than 50% of residents own cars).

Yes we need to make the subway more accessible but fuck off if you want to give New York shit for it compared to other US cities. This probable is at least a full order of magnitude more difficult in New York than anywhere else in the country. Isn't this what access-a-ride is for? I am all for making as many things as accessible as possible. But I just don't see it possible with the subway. it is ancient, 24/7 and the ratio of people in wheelchairs just doesn't make it worth it. I know that sucks and it's cold, but it's the truth. How would making even the top 50% of the subway stations accessible be done? What would it cost? 

As an alternative we have a large fleet of handicapped acceptable buses and provide shuttle services as well. 

Sometimes the world can't be 100% fair, and this is just one of them. cool ok so lets spend a billion dollars installing elevators in all subway stations

construction jobs! As a bus operator for the MTA I remember hearing that the city could not afford  to retrofit  all stations so they compromised. They made all buses ADA compliant. I know it sucks that you don't have the luxury of a train but they made sure that you do have an option with buses Well at least the Taxi of Tomorrow is wheelchair accessible and costs a flat $2.50. Err... Kingsbridge Rd finally got an elevator.....after 3 years of work. How the hell does it take THREE YEARS to build an elevator???? Remind me why we're building the Second Avenue subway when only 20% of our stations are ADA compliant to begin with? Access a ride  repaired hip here: lived with crutches taking subways for years.  
it's not so bad, and people are more likely to give you a seat.    
the bigger hazard was icy sidewalks and corner slush puddles.  
  
i got annoyed at some of the deep stations that require   
hundreds of stairs, while their elevators will reek of urine.  
another annoyance is when the conductors don't wait to    
pull out of a station when a connecting train comes in.  
i could never get to it fast enough to catch them in time.  

keep in mind that most wheelchair bound people can take  
"AccessARide", so they  have it easier than crutch people   
who are often considered too able bodied to qualify.  
this may be why the city gets away with a subway system  
that is not more wheelchair accessible, because it has both  
AccessARide and wheelchair accessible buses - instead.  

I'm just lucky my hip problems started after the Internet  
took off as a home shopping resource.  Carrying shopping  
home while on crutches is hard, even with a back pack.    
I remember the first time Walmart home delivered 140LBS  
of Cat Litter for free, I actually cried a little.   You're right, it's gotta be damn tough. There are almost 6 million subway riders every day. Even with elevators and other ADA infrastructure improvements, your wheelchair trips on the subway are going to be pretty uncomfortable due to crowds.

Our subway system carries more people every year then there are people in China. You can't easily shut parts down to make improvements, and the underlying and overlying infrastructure often make those improvements impossible anyway.  [deleted] Wow, that is way more pathetic than I had imagined.   Wow...that's pretty dismal.  There are some stops with accessible symbols on the official map that aren't showing up on yours. [This one](http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/NYCSubwayAccessibility_5328bffd4c8d0_w1500.jpg) might be more accurate. 2008? Hasn't this gotten better in 6 years? The Kingshighway station along the Q/B line has an elevator. There are a few more that do. There's also Access-a-ride I don't think the ADA allows for alternatives.  Homeless like to sleep/ do their business in them late at night. Even if they work you couldn't make me get on one of them. I'm taking the stairs. Part of the reason why we have a huge public transit system is that we have a huge city, meaning that having a large portion of inaccessible stations will make large parts of the city inaccessible to disabled people. Another reason that we have good transit is that having a car here is very expensive and inconvenient, which is not a burden that we should expect disabled people to deal with in addition to the challenges they already face. The size of the transportation system doesn't matter.  Most smaller systems which are accessible are in far poorer areas like Buffalo and Baltimore .  This is NYC. We can tax people for it.

If we can't provide access for everybody then simply put nobody should have access.  
 Yes that's what it's for but it's not great. Lets say you have a 2PM doctors appointment. You schedule an access-a-ride and they are set to pick you up at  12pm. 2 hours before your apointment. You are only going one subway stop so that should be more than enough time.  It's a 10 minute drive at most with traffic.

Guess what the access-a-ride van gets there at 4pm. It's so commonly ridiculously late that people have to just take cabs.  The cost doesn't matter.  It's the right thing to do.  Special Ed costs a lot more than regular ed.  Do we just let those with learning disabilities suffer? No we don't because it's the right thing to do. Because we can do two things at once? They're working on making the subway more acessible, it's just mind bogglingly huge [deleted] I wonder what the percentages look like in NYC. I just don't see many people in wheelchairs, and the stats seem to say daily wheelchair users make up somewhere from .5 to 1% of the total population. I should see a few dozen a day.  seoul's subway was built from the 70s on.  they've benefited massively from the early progress of the london underground, nyc subway, etc.

also plenty of streets have sidewalks, but they're those stupid sidewalks that have to be replaced every 6 months when a few bricks get loose  That one is missing Kingsbridge, Court Square, Utica, Fulton.....so it's not quite up to date. Probably, but not by as much as you might hope. I believe Forest Hills-71st has been added, not sure what others. If it didn't how would NYC MTA get away with noncompliance for thirty years?  They are *truly* foul smelling, used an elevator cause I had luggage for a trip to Boston, carried that stuff up the stairs when I got back to the city never again.  Buffalo and the rest of NYS collects millions and millions of dollars in taxes from *ding ding ding* NYC every year. 
 That last line is just silly, it would be impossible to have access for everyone, everywhere 100% of the time.  Are you 12? Or do you live in some fantasy wonderland in another universe.  You are an idiot. The world does not work that way. If I am in an iron lung should they need to make airplanes for me? also, they have infrastructure problems in some of the older stations. you can't just pop an elevator shaft/unit into any place you want. there needs to be ample structural support and space above on the street.  

Source: I ride elevators every day to get up to high floors of my building Check your walking privilege.  You see over three thousand unique people everyday? Didn't they narrow Roosevelt Ave just so they could put elevators in at Main St/Flushing too?  I'm sure there have been 1 or 2 others added to the list. Kingsbridge just got one. Utica Ave on the A/C got one recently. What are they going to do, shut down the subway until it complies?  I still use them when I have luggage. Push the buttons with your feet and don't touch the walls. You'll be fine. Um that's not true at all. Taxes do not flow out of NYC they flow in.

Sorry but it's such a very common misconception. The medicaid burden in nyc is so heavy it makes the rest of the state pay us here. Not to mention the taxes. We can just do rate hikes! We can make every station accessible, congrats your monthly is now $750.  I'm 11 Thank you.  You're totally right. Look at 31st street in Astoria - the sidewalks are too narrow as it is. Where are you going to drop elevators to the mezzanine,  and then again from there to the platform? 

The BMT Astoria line already had its platforms shaved back once, these are non trivial problems.  How very bipedalnormative of you. You don't even know if I have legs! What if I'm a merman? I would say way more than that on my commute.  Did you even bother to read the article you've linked? It lists a number of reasons why upstaters pay high taxes. Not a single one of those reasons is because that money is flowing into NYC.

If NYC and all of its taxes were independent of the state we would **unquestionably** be much much better off. 


 Nope, we send $12 billion upstate a year.

That's a little less than one Second Ave subway, every year, for a long fucking time.

 Why would raising taxes and making the wealthy and businesses pay for these increase the cost of your monthly metro card? I most certainly did years ago. Open the pdf which shows a more detailed analysis.

New York City’s share of total local cost of Medicaid  65.6%
New York City residents’ share of state personal income tax collections 39.9%

Upstate counties’ share of total local cost of Medicaid 22.0%
Upstate residents’ share of state personal income tax collections 24.7%


NYC accounts for more medicaid usage at 65.6% while only paying for 39.9% of it across the whole state.

Upstate (North and west of putname and rockland) accounts for 22% of usage but pays a total of 24.7%

What this says is NYC by no means covers its own. Westchester and the federal government pay the rest while upstate folks pay their own and then some flows down into the city. Just as I expected, jack up tax rates (on everyone who makes more than me). The solution to all of your problems I would imagine. Taxes aren't high enough yet.  Taxes should be tiered in a way such that even the very wealthy are brought down to a standard livable income. Bahahaha never gonna happen commie. Enjoy a lifetime of impotence and envy.
