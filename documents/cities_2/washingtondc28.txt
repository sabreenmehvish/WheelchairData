An Impressive Compilation of Scammers who regularly hit the District  [deleted] There's a guy in a motorized wheelchair and his lady friend that like to roll his wheelchair into the streets in Capitol Hill/Rosedale and tell people they need cash urgently to get on the bus to get to a doctor's appointment.  They've asked me three different times in one month.  Maybe he has a lot of appointments? another few:
    
* guy dressed as a Verizon lobbyist, says he just needs you to sign an exclusivity contract in order for your neighborhood to get FiOS; you never hear from him again.
* scammer puts up a sign at metro entrance stating that there are currently no delays on the X line, as soon as they run your farecard BAM! they change it to "15 MINUTE DELAY".
* guy sells you a "jumbo slice" claiming it's pizza.  Even though it saved your drunken ass that doesn't make it right. I've been scammed a few times trying to be the good neighbor. Definitely got the gutter scam before. 

Needless to say, from now on if someone comes to my door offering their services, I tell them to fuck off.  I love how they always a reason why nothing will help them except for you to give them money. I like to see how many other options I can come up with and see what rationalizations they have. Then, at the end, I give them nothing or maybe a buck if they were especially good.

But the guy who tries to bum gas money in full uniform so he can get to base? fuck that guy. They forgot about DC street parking That was a group of scheming midgets This was funny and I was disappoint you were at -1. At least I got you back to 0.  I saw one smoking a cigar and counting his money!
