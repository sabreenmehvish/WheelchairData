LOL.  Yeah, right.  He wanted to "preach" the heck out of her.  Twice. [deleted] So he hired an escort and he's upset he got screwed?  It's too bad, for everyone involved.  He has problems (physical), and she obviously has problems too.  It's a shame she victimizes people to deal with her issues.

Edit: Then again, when I am preached at, I feel like a victim too! Scumbag Hooker.
This is wretched. Fill her with the holy spirit? "He said he and the suspect agreed that she would come pick him up at his parents’ home, and they would spend an hour together for $100."

ಠ_ಠ That's strange... when I shattered my spine and ended up in a wheelchair getting laid was considerably easier. Women don't think of me as a threat in the chair.  I sometimes wish I was a chick. $100/Hr to hang, and I bet additional for some fun.
