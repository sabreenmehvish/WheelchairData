PSA: Peacock Lane turns on the lights tonight, but... ... having lived in the immediate vicinity of Peacock Lane for the past five Christmases, I humbly offer a few tips to keep it enjoyable for everyone:

**Getting There**

As in past years, the left turn lane from Southbound 39th onto Eastbound Stark will be blocked off.  Year-round (and clearly posted), there is no left turn from Southbound 39th onto Eastbound Belmont.  PPB will be running traffic control (mainly for pedestrian safety) at both ends of Peacock Lane, so please plan your route accordingly and be patient.

**Parking**

* When parking on one of the side streets, please remember not to block someone's driveway.   Seriously.  It happens every year, and some of my neighbors who've been patient about it in the past have tow companies on speed dial this year.

* The parking lots for the apartments on 41st are for tenants only.  It's clearly posted.  Parking there can also result in a tow.

* Likewise, the Walgreens parking lot is off limits for Peacock Lane parking and they, too, will have you towed.

**Traversing Peacock Lane**

* It gets crowded.  Hella crowded.  There are strollers, young children, old folks, wheelchairs, etc. that are all making their way around the lane.  At every house, people are going to stop and take pictures.  If your goal is to blast through there unfettered, it's better to get there early.  As the crowd grows, the pace slows to a crawl.

* Many of the homeowners have their yards roped or fenced off.  Please don't let (or encourage!) your kiddos to enter the yard, run around the displays, etc.  The homeowners work hard on their displays, and every year I see at least a dozen families who either aren't paying attention to what their kids are doing, or they're actively encouraging the kids to run into the yards for pictures and such.  Not cool.  I've seen kids knock down displays, pull down lights, even climb on some of the displays.  Please be respectful of what the homeowners have done and keep the kiddos out of the yards.

**Litter**

Every single year, our neighborhood becomes a collection of discarded Starbucks/Dutch Bros cups, fast food containers and even used diapers.  It's gross.  There are trash receptacles at each end of Peacock Lane.  Please dispose of your trash accordingly instead of just tossing it from your car onto the curb.

The homeowners on Peacock Lane are beyond gracious in doing what they do every year.  A few simple acts of common courtesy will keep it nice and enjoyable for everyone.  Thank you.

P.S.:  For more information on Peacock Lane, see:  http://www.peacocklane.org/ If you've never been but have heard about all the hype, prepare to be wildly underwhelmed. If you can, it's worth it to park a ways away and walk. The displays are much more enjoyable on foot than in a car. Used to date someone who lived in those apartments on 41st. Don't dare park in those spots, calling the tow truck is the local sport from mid to late December. TL:DR  Plan ahead, it's busy, watch your kids, and don't be an asshole.

Pretty much unwritten rules for most of society. :) I went last night for one of the three pedestrian-only nights. You could walk around in the street. There were other people but it wasn't uncomfortably crowded at all. I'm glad I went! PSA:Winter Wonderland at PIR, and it's for a cause. Just walked through there and this dickbag couple was letting their 3 year run up onto the yards.  You would think this is common sense... That should be the motto of Portland.  I went several times as a child and loved it.  I took my son once, and couldn't handle the crazy crowded cluster it's become.  

I saw more tears and fights than I thought possible for a family event.  

Bah.  Humbug. It is very underwhelming. I don't get the fascination. Some houses are really well lit while others do the bare minimum. It is kind of disappointing. I wish they would all get on the same page or stop doing it.  some of them don't put in the extra effort. The Seattle equivalent has a larger budget, lots of tech workers there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6nH4zhMV4
   They solve the parking problem by turning into a drive thru affair

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Il50S2MCc I currently live in those apartments. It's true.  I lived there last year and I was worried about traffic and parking  but it was never that bad. And it was pretty nice to see the lights from my kitchen window every night. Years ago, I dated a girl who lived on that street, too. Their family stayed with relatives for most of the nights the display was up. It kept them sane.

That was like...13 years ago... and it's so much more crowded now.

A few years ago I lived a whole block away and it even made me a little grinchy. I'm going tonight for the first time! How was parking for you? This is way better. We go on the walk the track night so we can bring our dogs.  Homeowner should just unleash the garden hose on the parents.  Easy to do, gets the point across, no permanent damage. This sub never disappoints!  You used to be able to drive through it, but traffic would get backed up, and the crowds are too massive for cars to fit now. If you lived at the Laurel Park apartments, then you should have gotten an off street parking space. I've been there the last 4 years and was joking with my partner that we should rent out our spot since we don't use it.  We parked 3 blocks away and there were spots I'm pretty underwhelmed You can still drive through it, though you shouldn't be allowed to. I live on the street next to peacock lane and the traffic is ridiculous.
