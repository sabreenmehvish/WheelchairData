Remembering John Callahan... A picture just popped up on my FB memories. 6 years ago I was waiting at a bus stop and a drunk women started to talk to me. She told me she had just left a funeral for her dear friend. His name was John Callahan. She told me about how special he was and how much he will be missed  as she drank out a cheap bottle of wine in a brown paper bag. She handed me [this card](http://i.imgur.com/2xfzyzM.jpg) and told me to keep it. It's kind of a blurry picture but it says "Psychiatric Ward" "Do not disturb any further". I thought it was neat because I also remember him, not personally but from living downtown. Living in NW part of town (nw 21st and Kearney)  in the 2000's you would have seen him on a regular basis, rolling around in his electric wheelchair. I saw him all the time and around the same time I would also see Vera Katz walking frequently. He passed away July 24th 2010 but his cartoons are timeless. Anyone care to share a memory or too? John was an incredible cartoonist who took humor from his pain and the tragedy that he went through.  I brought him into our cable access studio in 1987 (?) and had a great show.  He didn't pull any punches about his life as an alcoholic.  The show could have never aired on broadcast.   Years later, 60 minutes came to PDX and did a piece on him...it was much tamed down from what we did.

John had an apartment at NW 18th and Everett.  He trucked all around downtown in his motorized wheelchair (he was a quadriplegic, stemming from a car crash back in his drinking days).

If you want to know more abot his life, he wrote several books.  I recommend "Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot".

His web page is still active at  www.callahanonline.com.

EDIT: fixed link, thanx Mr Robot.

 He was an incredible presence. I remember reading Robin Williams at one point was interested in bringing his life story to film. No memories of mine, but he did have a few minutes on the Portland episode of Insomniac at the 7:30 mark.
https://youtu.be/K-6Y-V8OE-I Around 1995, I was just beginning to work in animation, and my old mentor told me he had a friend who was a nationally syndicated cartoonist. He asked me if I would like to go and meet his friend to get some advice on a career in cartooning. His friend turned out to be John Callahan. He gave me his phone number on a slip of paper. 

I took my sketchbook and brought it along on a Saturday morning to Mr Callahan's house, after arranging to meet him on the telephone. (I'm remembering his apartment being somewhere around 25th and NW Kearney or Overton St.) After a few knocks on the door, a large man opened the door and from down the hall, I heard a voice say, "I'm expecting a guest! Let him in. Let him in!"

I was led back into the living room of the apartment, and there he was in his wheelchair, with his bright red hair. A big smile cracked across his face, and he stuck out his hand. "Hi, I'm John. Good to meet you. Jim tells me you're a cartoonist eh? Well let's see your stuff!" He grabbed my sketchbook out of my hands and began to flip through the pages. After going through much of the book, and not saying anything at all, I said: "Any good?" He looked at me and said: "Oh I really like your stuff, it's very dreamlike. Beautiful brush work. I always wished I could use a brush, but I can't hold my hands steady enough. I can barely hold a pencil, after my accident, so I just try to let the writing and the humor do most of the work." 

He told me to just keep a notebook and write down everything funny that happened during the day, and any funny thoughts that come to mind. To send samples to editors all over the country, and to be prepared for mass rejection, but to just enjoy what you do, and to keep drawing and creating. He wheeled me back and introduced me to his assistant, a man paid to help him get in and out of bed, use the bathroom and help him clean and cook meals. He explained that he was on a very fixed income and that a lot of his money went into his care. He showed me that very bedroom with the bed and all the straps from the Dave Attel video, and told me that he had extreme difficulty sleeping and just getting in and out of bed. I got a small tour of the rest of the apartment, and got to look through stacks of his unpublished cartoons before he gave me a copy of his book, "Don't worry, he won't get far on foot". "I wanted to send this to Woody Guthrie, but it came back to me in the mail, so you might as well have it." John said, pushing the book into my hands.

I ran into him for years after that in NW Portland, and he always had some funny thing to say, some funny anecdote and a smile. 

Some of the best advice on being an artist and a cartoonist I've ever gotten, and one of the most gentle and funny guys you could ever meet. Thanks for taking the time to talk to a skinny cartoonist kid John! Rest in peace.




 Well, I've been PMd asking for one of John's (probably) unpublished cartoons, so here it is:

I bartended at Wimpys for a while and saw John cruising around all the time. I saw a lot of people who had problems with alcohol. I replaced a bartender named K-man who was friends with everyone, who were upset I replaced their friend. I got to know a lot of regulars including a guy named Keith. I still see some of the regulars here and there. And Keith changed his local haunt up to Silver Dollar Pizza where I last saw him. He was friends with the owner. Recently Keith passed on from a heart attack I think but if you go into silver dollar you can see a 49ers Jersey hanging with Keith on the back in remembrance. RIP old Keith and Callahan. I am glad his cartoons still make people happy.  I think I might have been one of the camera operators for this show. Timing is correct. I remember John really well, and the stories he told impacted me deeply. I couldn't imagine getting up every morning with the pain.  Robin said about him:  “John is the funniest man on four wheels.”

EDIT:  John and I were having a discussion over pizza about how people didn't want to use the word "paralyzed" in regards to him or even refer to his wheelchair.  I suggested that it was time to invent a politically-correct term in regards to him so that those speaking this term could do so without fear of being insulting or causing pain.

John gave me a look of disdain and asked me what I would suggest, not knowing if I was in earnest or pulling his leg.

I replied: "Downwardly mobile!" Insomniac.  Why can't we have quality television anymore? > and got to look through stacks of his unpublished cartoons

John let me xerox a bunch that I really liked...did you get any copies?

Also, John wrote a very funny pamphlet that was an outreach to alcoholics who were considering recovery.  
It was later turned into [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSCMwOiczCs)

 Thanks for posting that.  John did some cartoons with K-man in them...I don't know if they were ever published.  Many of his cartoons had troubles getting published. 

 The studio was at Liberty Cable...the group was TVAP.  My Reddit handle ought to ring a bell if you were there. No sadly, I didn't. 
Ah yes, I remember the animation! It was done by a friend of mine. Was there a particular cartoon or theme that you would appreciate viewing? I liked all of his stuff really. The more the outrageous the better. I really liked the just plain kooky and surreal stuff he did too, like this one: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OOtI6uVvjZY/TKYk4Tc6AdI/AAAAAAAAAfU/2bsao_mbpGo/s1600/callahan1.jpg

The eyeballs and characters just make for a great single panel cartoon.
 Have you seen the Dutch documentary about him? It's pretty good. Think I caught it on youtube with english subtitles a while back. Of course the Dutch loved him and his sense of humor. Ha! John liked punchlines that were only 1 or 2 words long...check out another one of [my favorite cartoons](http://imgur.com/1YzyYWo).
 Dig it! Thanks for sharing that. I gotta collect more Callahan. And here's another...you did mention[The more the outrageous the better.  ](http://imgur.com/KJye9jC)  This is my favorite surreal cartoon of his.
