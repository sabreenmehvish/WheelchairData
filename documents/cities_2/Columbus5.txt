Wheelchair Accessible in Polaris? I'm taking my SO's mom out to dinner and a movie tomorrow night.  She's in a wheelchair and I wanted to make sure I took her out to dinner somewhere that would be easy.  This is part of our Christmas gift to her, so I was thinking somewhere nicer like J Gilbert's or a Cameron Mitchell.  Anyone have any recommendations? As long as the building was built post 1992 or something you should be fine. Polaris is all new stuff. IMO, J. Gilbert's is always fantastic. The prix fixe menu is totally the way to go. Food is great, drinks are very good and the service is wonderful. Martini Modern Italian is wheelchair friendly if you were looking for a place in the short north Molly Woos and Brio are both wheelchair accessible and very close to the mall's valet service, if you'd want an easy way for everyone to go in together. This. Any modern place of public accommodation is going to have to be accessible. 

 I think this is the way I'm going to go.  I've been to happy hour there, but never for dinner.  Good service always makes such a difference in situations like this! My Grandfather used to be in a wheelchair and I've noticed that it's always up to spec, but that doesn't always make it easy.  She's really heavy and in a wheelchair and I've never taken her out without my SO, so I'm just a little nervous.
