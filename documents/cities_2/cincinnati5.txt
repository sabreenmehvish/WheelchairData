Anyone know who this guy helping someone in a wheelchair participate in the Flying Pig is?  WLWT covered a man pushing a wheelchair yesterday. If it's the same couple, then that's his dad. I saw them go past Kroger. Very cool. I gave that guy a cup of water at our water stop. The guy in the wheelchair would just point at the guy pushing him with a big smile on his face. Someone else saw that right after I posted this. I actually thought I'd deleted this post! Regardless, thank you!
