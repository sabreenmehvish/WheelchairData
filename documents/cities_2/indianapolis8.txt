Lucas Oil Raceway charging handicapped people access to handicapped seating on top of their entry fee. I have a friend in a wheelchair who was told he would have to pay an extra $100 today at the track to be able to sit in the handicap section.  He refused and got angry and he was escorted out of the place by 6 policemen.  He said the cops told him they are charging everyone $50-$100 to get access to the handicap section. That's immoral, and most likely a blatant violation of the ADA. Just for clarification, did your friend buy GA tickets?  The Wheelchair seats out there are all in the reserved seating section, which costs more than GA.  That could be the source of the problem. Has he contacted the ACLU? What are they going to do? Stand up and voice their opinions?  It is. http://www.ada.gov/ticketing_2010.htm.  Yeah, I have my doubts about the legitimacy of this story. It sounds like someone misunderstood the ticket category they had.  They are required to provide handicap seating in all price categories. I get that, but a GA doesn't get you a seat, anywhere.  It just gets you in the door.  I know all the separate stands have ADA seating, but if he just bought GA he probably would have had to find the hill or separate area that was ADA for GA.
