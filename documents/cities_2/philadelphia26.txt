Some sicko stole my younger cousin's wheelchair, I am disgusted, how could someone do this!?  It just amazes me that people could stoop this low, my uncle took the wheelchair out front and went back inside to get my cousin, when he got back out only minutes later the wheelchair was gone. 

I know not much can be done at this point but all I ask is that you keep your eyes and ears open reddit.
