Looking to donate a dog wheelchair Anyone know of a good shelter that would need one? Could even be a person you know with an ailing dog. Just want to make sure it goes to a pet in need and not flipped for profit on Craigslist  That's nice of you. Maybe you can google some local rescues that maybe specialize in helping dogs with health issues, and give them a call.
