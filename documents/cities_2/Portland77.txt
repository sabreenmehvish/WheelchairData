Good luck.  And try to avoid the bridges. You might try contacting the ADRC, too: https://www.adrcoforegon.org/consite/index.php

 another place to contact: http://www.bridgestochange.com/ Is offender short for sex offender?

Not trying to be a dick, I literally am just curious. Try a bridge. You can also look into taking Rent Well classes to help improve your 'marketability' if you will: http://www.housingconnections.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=14 Yes Typically there aren't plug ins on bridges so charging my chair would be hard, but thanks.  Was the chair before or after the felony? chairs have been around for a loooong time Before  i meant was he crippled before or after his felony

*waits for downvotes* that makes it worse no we know. but who cares man? If you say so..  i'm just curious if the two are related.
