Volunteer ops? I'm in a wheelchair so physical work isn't easy for me, wondering what kind of volunteer ops there are for people such as myself.  Check out volunteermatch.org or idealist.org. A lot of organizations need help with database entry...I know that doesn't sound exciting but it's really helpful! OPB has periodic opportunities answering phones during pledge drives, calling donors, preparing mailings, etc.  Volunteer.opb.org! I've found some great volunteer opportunities on http://handsonportland.org/ . I suggest you check it out; the places I've volunteered with have answered all my questions quickly and helpfully. Some of the volunteer opportunities specify whether the location is wheelchair-accessible, so this might be a good place to start! 

 You can volunteer at [OMSI](https://www.omsi.edu/support/volunteer) if that's in your area of interest, there's plenty of people in wheelchairs working there. I'm a volunteer there myself, and it's pretty laid back work as long as you're engaging people/kids or doing whatever role you're assigned. Shame the greedy mall shoppers with images like this http://i.imgur.com/ti95mA4.jpg , and remind them that jesus said "you cannot serve both god and money" Dead link.
 Then whine about how your feelings get hurt when you do it and it has hurt your 'business' of buying old shit, calling it vintage and somehow making money off of it. Sorry, it should be http://www.handsonportland.org
