Portland is creating a dispatch center for people needing a ride in a wheelchair-accessible vehicle  [deleted] [deleted] 35% of working aged adults are on some sort of disability program. Both Uber and Lyft have this option afaik. There is already a nationwide service for this that uses local transport vendors. I don’t have my notes with me to identify the service provider, but what a giant fucking waste of money.

The issue with lack of medical transportation is the paramedic requirement and lack of paramedics. Why the hell would someone who wants a paramedic license want to be a taxi driver? No, they want other careers.

This infuriates me. What they should do is create a centralized dispatch for regular taxi rides so people can get the benefits of Uber/Lyft while keeping control and money local.  Taxi drivers are already independent contractors, so the only difference is who gives out the rides.

Surge pricing could be banned or locally decided on, customers could a nearby ride regardless of company, feedback ratings could be implemented so poor-quality drivers are given less rides, and those who don't want to use an app and credit card could get rides just the same.

To make sure the dispatching process runs smoothly, have a board of taxi drivers (who would be dependent on it) oversee it. Disability includes a lot of conditions other than wheelchair usage.

Wheelchair usage rates are around 1% in the US and other industrialized nations, and around 2% in the developing world.
 They do, and so does Trimet [deleted] No it doesn’t. 

There is a supply issue and a demand increase which is the root cause of the issue. Having another avenue to obtain a ride doesn’t fix the lack of operators. [deleted] Great, I hope they can increase their staffing too. Hard to pick someone up when you can’t get someone to drive it.
