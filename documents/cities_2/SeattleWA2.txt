He made sure to have a crowd before attempting!  r/nonononoyesno/ He does this all the time. 1st & Virginia, I think  /u/stabbot r/gifsthatendtoosoon The real crime here is the vertical video.  Attempting what?  Suicide? r/holdmybeer Dumbass /r/killthecameraman Tf was that minivan thinking? 

“Oh yeah wow he’s coming down fast, I better suddenly pull out in front of him.”  Compo claim? More like /r/nononomoyes I've seen him all over 3rd. Goes crazy fast. Yup it was definitely on Virginia when I saw him right next to me. I was day drinking to enjoy the last bits of Seattle before I leave and this guy just zoomed past. I looked back and forth like wtf and wondered how the hell he gets back up again, it must be tiring. I've never seen it. Not sure if he needed the wheelchair before but he might need it now

I always wanna see what happens after  Yeah, that and when something dramatic happens, keep filming! The guy is on a street lined with buildings on one side and trees on the other. A vertical video would actually be worse, as the action is happening partially vertically in the video, not horizontally. 

The real crime here is not understanding proper video orientation for the situation.  Watch it again. It's pretty clear that the minivan doesn't have visibility beyond the car they're parked behind until right before the wheelchair hits.

They did what anyone else would do in that situation. Anyone coming down the hill in a vehicle that could actually maneuver would have been able to avoid that crash. Wut? Wtf was the wheel chair Evel Kinevil thinking.  Lololol right? The heck were they thinking? 

“Let’s just stick my front end out some more, he might need some extra space to get by”

And It’s not like it’s a biker, it’s a guy in a freaking wheelchair! I Hope he can still roll out of there.  TIL Probably the stupidest thing I’ve heard....  ever..... (on Reddit) I’m pretty sure I’ve seen that guy around before. If it’s the same guy I pushed him up 2nd once to Virginia and he said “ok thanks!” And then wheeled away down Virginia from 2nd to 3rd. I was just like “uh. Uuuuuhh. Ok?” 

Obviously Virginia from 1st to pike place is far steeper and brick but I don’t think it’s this guys first rodeo.  Yeah... this is totally the minivan’s bad /S didnt realize a guy in a wheelchair has the right of way on the street  The definition of [Cheap Thrills ](https://youtu.be/J1b22l1kFKY)  I might be wrong, But You can’t be parked. Then start pulling into traffic, hit someone and it not be your fault.  
 Watch the video again. The wheel chair hits the parked truck, not the van.
