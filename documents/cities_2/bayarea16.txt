Short Flat Hikes along the coast? My girl has a broken leg, but we still want to do a short hike or two with views of the coast, do you have any recommendations?

I was even thinking of renting a wheelchair for her so we can do slightly longer hikes. The coast loop at Wilder Ranch! Best views by far and a flat loop I think about 2 miles total.  http://parks.smcgov.org/devils-slide-trail

it is paved, great views, but a little hilly.  I severely broke my leg back in April and was either in a wheelchair or on crutches until about a month ago. If you guys are active, and want to stay active while she's recovering, I *highly* recommend getting some of these Millennial In-Motion Pro crutches: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E8TBAEI?th=1

They're infinitely better than those shit-ass aluminum crutches they give you at the hospital, they're great for traveling since they fold up, they're comfortable and easy to use, AND they have shocks on the bottom so you can use them "off road" I was able to play disc golf on these at Golden Gate Park only 3 months after the accident and we also flew down to San Diego in July and played 3 courses down there and also got to walk around the entire zoo, no way I would have been able to do that on regular crutches. In Alameda. Starting at Southshore shopping center, walk along shore to Rock Wall winery. Or vice versa. I would imagine that it would take a while with one good leg.  https://www.fws.gov/refuge/don_edwards_san_francisco_bay/

The Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge is a pretty flat coastal salt marsh right by the bay https://goo.gl/maps/P8mz2oQiHFB2

Cowell-Purisima Coastal Trail. Not necessarily my favorite, but it's easy to access (just south of HMB off Hwy 1). When I went last time, the trail was only open on weekends -- double check if that's still the case before going! 2 miles â‰ˆ 3.2 km

It's flat but travels along the top of the coastal cliffs.  Great views indeed.  It's dirt but hard, though a little rutted. A friend got his skinny-wheeled racing bike to handle it, so I imagine wheelchair tires could. 

If you want something more urban, hike the West Cliff bike path inside the city limits. Again good views of the ocean, but with pavement, and parking lots here and there.
 Note that parking can be a challenge. Get there early on weekends, or go on a weekday. These look awesome! Thanks!
Edit: btw I'm assuming that is your review on the page, we have the same first name!  Great link! A trip down Hwy 1 from Pt Reyes was on the list, so this might be the one! > West Cliff bike path 

I'm googling west cliff, but all I see is a bike path in Santa Cruz? yeah, I figured I would put a review even though I usually don't do that kind of thing, they're that good. When I was buying them I was on the fence and kind of running blind so maybe this will help someone.  If you're heading all the way down to Santa Cruz, consider checking out Shark Fin Cove. There's a bit of a dip from the road to the trail (you have to cross some rail tracks), but it's one of my favorite spots along Hwy 1 in the Bay Area. Part of the trail descends to the beach, but the fork that heads north is gorgeous.

https://goo.gl/maps/QjvrBkdYUDq It is a bike path, but it's right along the cliffs and there's way more walking than biking.  Yes, it's more of an urban experience than a wilderness hike, but with waves, pelicans, surfers, and a great view.
