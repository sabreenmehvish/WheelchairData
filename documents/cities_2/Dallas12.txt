National Veterans Wheelchair games this weekend in Dallas  If you're looking for something to do this weekend and want to be inspired please consider coming to the National Veterans Wheelchair Games. The Games are primarily at the Dallas Convention Center in downtown Dallas and runs from today (Saturday) through Monday.

Also this year - for the first time in the history of the Games - there will also be veterans participating in rowing. The rowing event is at White Rock Lake and is being run by the Dallas United Crew rowing club, who are providing a custom rowing barge, special rowing shells, adaptive seating and other gear. The rowing event will be held on the west side of White Rock Lake at the large parking lot / boat ramp near Fisher Road on Monday. I'll be there volunteering, it's going to be great!
