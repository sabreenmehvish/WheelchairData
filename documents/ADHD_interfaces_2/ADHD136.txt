Wrote this whole text in the title and posted it This was last night. Yesterday morning I poured water into a glass container to microwave it then put it in the fridge. Went on a first date in the evening, went to put my to-go box in my purse and put a spoon in there instead. This is a normal day for me!  Actually, that’s a normal day for MOST of us here..
 Why did you want to microwave water? That makes me feel so much better, but I had to share the ridiculousness of it! My coffee maker broke so I measured out the amount of water in a glass measuring cup to heat up and pour over the grounds. I could’ve boiled in in a pot but all of my dishes are dirty. 🤷‍♀️ You don't have a kettle? 

I feel like just never having clean dishes is an adhd mood. It totally is. I have a kettle in my cart on amazon, and I also gave a new coffee maker. It’s still in the box.
