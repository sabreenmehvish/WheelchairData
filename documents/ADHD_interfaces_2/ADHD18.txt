Your non-dominant hand I wrote this on facebook to help non-adhd’ers understand adhd, and help those undiagnosed maybe decide to seek help.

Wanted to share.

Clean your house for an hour using your non-dominant hand.

Write a letter with it.

Practice guitar as a lefty if you’re a righty, and vice versa.

With time, these things can become easier. But they are an uphill climb because you’re working against a more natural way of doing the task. You’re working against your wiring.

What you’ll find is that you become mentally tired after forcing yourself to do this for prolonged periods. Now that you’re mentally spent, keep going. Better yet, switch to something mentally challenging like writing a paper. No break inbetween, stop working with your less dominant hand and immediately switch to something requiring continued effort or mental stamina.

That’s ADHD, and that explains why I’ve noticed the diagnosis seemingly drifting away from “attention” and more toward impaired executive functioning skills and poor self regulation. 

Executive functions include basic cognitive processes such as attentional control, cognitive inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. 

The most noticeable side effect of working with weaker executive functioning skills is supposed inattention...but we’ve BEEN paying attention! We’ve been working hard at keeping up with typical expectations of us, and that itself requires direct mental effort...like playing a left handed guitar as a right handed player. It’s just that by the time we’ve got mental heavy lifting to do, we’ve been doing things in a more challenging way all day! Our brains are tired now, we need a break to rest our brains, but that is seen as “laziness, innatentive, unfocused, unable to be consistent”...etc.

If you were asked to do 100 push ups, but you had an hour to do them, you’d space things out! Your arms would grow very tired from the persistent effort of trying to tackle it all in one pass, and no one would think anything about spacing them out. You still finished on time. You still put forth the effort. You just did it in a way that wouldn’t wear you out and lead to physical exhaustion!

...Back to your hands. Switch to something you can easily do with your less dominant hand. Playing your instrument the way you learned, for example. Much easier to do, and is based now in habit due to the amount of repetition you’ve given this ask over the years! Piece of cake!

It’s not that our less dominant hand is useless.  It’s more than capable of pulling the heavy load! With routines, repetition, and forming the right habits, we can shred with that hand! Just look at Van Halen!

We can’t very easily expect our non-dominant hand to be efficient doing what the dominant hand does, it never had the training to develop that way and isn’t wired properly for it. It would’ve been harder to train the less dominant hand to be dominant, which is why we focus on other things it can do to contribute and be effective...even essential! It’s easier not to go against how that hand is wired, as this saves effort and frustration trying to make the less dominant hand do something in a way in which it may never excel.

But that hand isn’t useless. Again, when we let the less dominant hand do what it does best, we can shred! All the picking technique in the world won’t help you make much music on a guitar without the help of that less dominant hand!

People with ADHD working to fit in spite of their wiring are trying to pick with their less dominant hand. It’s harder, and when they can’t pull off the same results they’re seen as inferior and criticized. Had they instead allowed themselves to recognize that they aren’t wired that way, but can do this other thing REALLY WELL that’s ALSO super important, they could thrive without missing a beat.

You can’t change that you have ADHD. Why work against it? Find out how to accomplish your goals while playing into your strengths, not by working harder at being like the others. You’re not them, and that’s awesome! You get to chart your own course, which has the potential for discovering new paths!

Thanks to ADDitude podcast episode 135 for helping me see it this way Am I a dick for asking for a tl;cr Thank you, yep. This.

So sick of people telling me or implying (even people who have ADD/ADHD) that it's all no big deal, that I simply need to get started on a project and it'll be fine, that I just need to try harder, that I just need more maturity.

People without ADHD don't get that WE ARE TRYING WAY HARDER THAN MOST OF YOU! If you had to CONSTANTLY use up your mental energy simply to stay on the task at hand, plus still had to conjure up more mental energy for the actual task, you would be in a floppy pile in the corner of the room, crying. We're still out here trying every fucking day anyhow (at least anytime we're capable of it), because we have no choice. No, it’s an adhd group, reading long text is a pain TLDR: ADHD is better described as executive function disorder rather than inattention. It's comparable to doing everything with the non-dominant hand, so it's more tiring, sooner or later **causing** inattention. ADHD shouldn't be stigmatized as much, we're not worthless. lol I skimmed it and headed to the bottom for a TL;CR Nop, I just read the half of the text. ADHD = using non-dominant hand to do shit. 😂😂😂 >gracefully forgives request, while not actually granting the request itself

The ADHD is strong with this one

:) Thanks man. I bounced around the text again and I think I got the gist. I wish I knew what my dominant hand was good at, though Lil bit

Don’t know how to summarize it in two sentences though🤷🏻‍♂️ No worries. We all get the struggle here! Found it amusing is all :)

Peace & love
