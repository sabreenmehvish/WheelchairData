QUESTION: Parents of elementary kids with ADHD How do you motivate your child to do reading assignments? I’m caring for an 8 year old who came home with a sheet he’s supposed to read that is essentially one giant block of text with no pictures. I’m trying breaking it up into paragraphs but in case that doesn’t go as planned, any suggestions? MUCH appreciated! Break the assignment up into paragraphs with breaks in between. 

Otherwise you can try to have him answer questions about the text as he goes along. 

Getting boys to read spans not only ADHD concerns, but also engaging a boy in a text that may not be interesting to boys in general. I’ve tried both of those things with not success  When I was that age I would use a ruler to keep track of where I was on the page. I still do, to be honest. Sometimes I would draw pictures to get my ideas down, or make up songs to remember key points. My daughter seems to have an easier time retaining what she‘s read if she reads out loud, so she can talk it through as she reads. She also makes study forts under the table, or reads standing up.

With ADHD kids interest is everything. My mom is a retired special ed teacher, and she made it her mission to find ways of getting boys (and her daughters) interested in reading. If the boy you‘re caring for has a ILP/IEP, sometimes teachers can select reading materials for them that will interest them. Graphic novels are great, or anything that interests them. If they can’t change the material, they may be able to give you some pointers. A lot of teachers have specialized training, children with ADHD or ADHD themselves, so they can give good advice.
