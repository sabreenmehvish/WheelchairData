What I've learned from a month of facing ADHD head on I spent almost the entire month of January trying to figure out what on earth I need to do in order to straighten out a lot of facets of my life, and I think I've learned a lot of information that wasn't parsed into relative experiences for us who are trying to learn to manage our lives better. A lot of what's out there tends to be correct, but it's sometimes hard to make a connection right away, and I felt that a lot of the time I spent was simply trying to find a place for what I learned among my thought process and daily life. So as both a tool for anyone else trying to do what I did and also as a bit of a text reminder for myself of what I've learned, I wanted to compile a list of things that "clicked" for me, but in the words of my own experience and how they worked after they were applied and assimilated, not so much in the terms they were originally written in. Throughout the article I'll link the valuable sources I've used so that if you want to gain your own take or if this is not something you relate to, you can have your own little adventure (you can start it by warping all around [ADDitude Mag](https://www.additudemag.com/) if you want to take the exact route I did.) I can't promise it'll be fun, but it's extremely interesting. 

Short background of myself to help gather perspective and how you can relate / compare / contrast: I'm 24, male, ADHD-PI, and comorbid conditions are anxiety, panic disorder, and mild depression. I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI at 19, treated with stimulant meds (but no therapy whatsoever) on and off for 4 years (Concerta -> Ritalin -> Adderall -> Provigil -> Adderall), and finally talked with my doctor and committed to staying with Adderall XR 20mg with a IR 5mg booster in the evenings back in December. It is working very well in all aspects and I'm either at or close to my ideal dosage. Anxiety / depression / panic is treated by Venlafaxine and I feel mostly comfortable living with all three of those now.



Alright, now to the major things I've learned.

-- Speaking of medications, I learned that medications do not completely cure ADHD in many people. One of the main things I thought when medicated previously was "yeah, that's all I have to do. This is all I'm going to be able to do to get better, just have to stay with the medication regiment and we're good here." I think the moment I admitted that there was a lot more to the problem and that the meds were only one of the pieces to the puzzle for me was the moment I started to peel the proverbial onion of my ADHD, if you will. The first layer was realizing that yes, medication is absolutely helping me, but no, it is not enough. It took a lot of reflection on my behaviors and being aware of how I acted on a daily basis, especially from my partner's perspective, to understand how this all worked. Which leads me to the next one...


-- I realized the need to work through the shame I felt from the disorder and attribute my executive functioning deficits to ADHD. Simultaneously, I knew full well that I could not simply cast these deficits away as if they were not something I was responsible for managing; they're still part of my life, and I need to do something about it. But before I could, I needed to admit that no, these are not behaviors that I can give myself personal grief for. It's all part of the disorder. Realizing this actually made me a lot more encouraged to do everything I could do adequately manage my ADHD, as the focus was on overcoming the proper source of the problem. I also realized that this is why I was beating myself up all of the time, and gave me a more solemn mental attribution to the problem of self-esteem I had been reading about in ADHD people: we focus our energy on criticizing our conscience rather than our disorder, and as a result we're never content with what is probably a perfectly functional set of values. 


-- As the last paragraph of thought demonstrated, I noticed that it helped me find connections and ways that some of the one-off facts or blurbs that you'll read about ADHD actually applied. It's easy to sit down and think "oh yeah, we have self-esteem issues, that's totally correct", but then when we try and explain these things to others trying to figure themselves out without really any context whatsoever. I'm not going to go all Gung-ho on trying to find a reason for why this happens as that's not the point of what I'm writing, but it's something to take note of. Most of what clicked for me while I was reading through resources was in [Your Life Can Be Better](http://a.co/2Z8j0Xf), which I'm sort of basing the writing style from here as it Dr. Puryear does a great job making the disorder as analogous as possible throughout the book. 


-- Further along in my escapade of ADHD research and self-awareness exercises it's become more clear to me that nothing is going to "just click". No one piece of advice is going to instantly change the way I think and operate on a daily basis. Furthermore, nothing has come easy right away as I've noticed that many things have had years of neglect attached to them. 

   Let's take the organization of my belongings as an example. If I were to have kept things well-organized and made a habit of a system where I put things back where they belong all of these years, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have just found an old DS game inside of a shot glass in my sock in a plastic bag on a shelf under my computer desk, the computer desk being the only thing listed that I realized I even owned anymore (and even that was a question mark for a while given how it was buried in things). Now I have to not only find a place for all of these things I just found and put them there, but I have to establish a system for basically everything, as with my disorder clutter tends to build up more quickly and therefore I need a more clear habit structure. Once I establish this structure, though, I'm going to be just fine and maintaining it will be a lot easier than trying to catch up. I've realized that a lot of things are like this, from cleaning the house to catching up on finances to sorting out my mind. A lot of initial setup is required for many of these tasks in order to get them lined up to be maintained. There has been a ton of progress, and with the progress comes nearly immediate positive reinforcement.


-- Time is awful and I still hate it. I think there are ways I can still learn to handle time better, but in the interim I'm working on slowly building up ways to work with both myself and the demands of time, and making reasonable compromises. I work as a rideshare driver, so I have the luxury of a more flexible schedule. I feel like I absolutely bludgeon that luxury by scheduling myself hours, but if I don't actually give myself a very immediate incentive to get my rear end out the door, I pretty much end up rabbit-holing on Reddit or Wikipedia or getting hooked on a game. 

   So to combat this, I've made a reasonable compromise that's a little intricate, but works perfectly for me: I take one ride request from my apartment, and I re-assess everything immediately after that one ride. Upon getting the first request, I set two timers. The first timer is for 10 hours, as that's all I'm ever going to subject myself to work-wise for a day. The second timer is for four hours, as I cannot be out longer than five as I have to care for my puppy, and in the worst-case scenario I'll be dragged an hour away from home. If I feel like a diseased hippopotamus after my first ride, I let out a disgruntled hippopotamus noise and am allowed to head home for self-prescribed puppy therapy (and probably lunch). However, I notice that I generally am fine after the first ride and want to do a few more. It's like I get defiant and want to show the emotionally unkempt hippopotamus within me that I can wrangle it into the shadows for longer. I allow myself one hour at home until I must take one more ride request. When the 10 hour timer goes off (and of course I always forget about when it does, as time and I do not get along and therefore do not interact with each other very often), if I'm at home, the day's over. If I'm at work, I finish the ride I'm on and set my destination for home. And if during this time I want to fight myself to keep working, then I've already won the battle, right?


-- I still have days where I somehow manage to accomplish a whole bunch posting on Reddit, playing Pokemon, hanging with the puppy, and talking with friends and maybe making lunch for myself if I remember. I still slip up quite a bit. As I've realized in one of those paragraphs above, though, I'm not going to fix this on a dime, and I need to realize that I'm going to be fine in the long run if I stick with it as I'm continuously making steady progress. I don't beat myself up for it anymore. Instead, as soon as I realize something is going on, I drop what I'm doing and meditate and practice mindfulness. And I don't mean formal, lotus-position meditate here, I simply get deep into my own thoughts and analyze what exactly is going on. I reflect on what led me to those circumstances and increase my awareness of what I'm doing that leads to it, and finding a solution. I also added that meditation and mindfulness to my morning routine recently, a routine which I've also failed to do every day, but on the flipside I've also now completed that routine more than I have in the past. So ha, take that, self-criticism!


-- Routines are actually incredibly important to me, as much as I wholeheartedly wanted to deny it at first. Understanding the difference between executive and autonomic functioning helped me a lot here, and watching [Dr. Russell Barkley's lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0) on this helped me grasp the concept. Routines and habits don't require executive functioning, so they're a lot easier to work with for ADHD folks. Making something a habit rather than a task that you need to actively remember to do and reward yourself for is an incredibly useful tool. 

   My morning routine now is a great example. I began the night before by just running it through in my head of how it was going to go. The next morning, I got up -> took my medications -> took the dog out -> put him back in his crate -> showered -> took 5 minutes to relax -> got dressed -> fed the dog -> walked the dog -> took a 10 minute break to play with him -> put him back in his crate -> turned on my driver apps for work and began folding clothes until I got a ride. I seamlessly went from waking up to working and sleepwalked through all of the mundane morning stuff. The next morning it was raining and I made an excuse not to walk the dog, and the domino effect stopped. My day mostly unhinged, and I worked about a half-day's worth. But I learned a way to patch that routine up, and now I won't even have to think about the rain when I want to walk the dog anymore. I'm sure another snare will come up again, but the longer I do this, the more automatic it becomes and the less snares I'm going to encounter.



I can update this with more as it comes up if there's enough interest. Hopefully this isn't too ridiculously long, ramble-y, or self-observant to be of use. It's simply one of those things that I noticed myself wishing I had heard someone else give a personal example of when I began this whole process of research and I'd like to help out someone if they're anything like I was (and based on what I've learned from lurking here, there's at least a few.) I also obviously wanted to give back what I learned from many of you here, as I have been lurking for a while and feel bad about not contributing quite as much. Hopefully this is the start of a habit of getting more involved!

Feel free to ask questions on specific topics that I haven't covered as well as the ones I have, I'm probably forgetting things and I would be happy to expound on the things that I did forget. 


tl;dr  what i wrote actually talks about not giving out buzzwords and instead reading more expansive analogous or relevant details so i'm going to leave this at yes, it's probably tl and i'm sorry that you dr :( Thank you for this information :)) "Routines and habits don't require executive functioning, so they're a lot easier to work with for ADHD folks." -- I didn't know this! Interesting. I was diagnosed ADHD-PI last week so I'm very new to this. I'm going to check out the links you provided. Thanks for the info! Yeah, it's handy! I mean they require executive functioning to form them, I wasn't super clear on that, but once they're formed they're mostly automatic functions. Example: you don't think about peeling a banana, you've just done it enough times that you always subconsciously do it before you eat it.
