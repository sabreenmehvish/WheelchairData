Reading on Ebook w BIG TXT (less on page, faster page turning) changes EVERYTHING! I've actually found my Kobo Glo ebook reader helps immensely with reading. I avoided it for ages \(kinda weird compared to books\) but recently I tried enlarging Epub text MUCH LARGER \(less on page, faster page turning\) which means I can read walking &/or between any other task &/or on toilet \- huzzah!

Translates to 1000&#37; more words read, more highlights and notes made. I just read 'American Gods' \(amaze\-balls\) in less than a week \(man, I can't remember the last time I finished a book\), halfway through another.

Having much larger text, and flipping pages faster makes a huge difference \- easier to read and digest the info, can look up word def's on the fly, highlight things and even make notes \- which caters for everything my ADHD brain wants to do, and allows me to stay in the Story world. I can also read articles I save to Pocket \(tho is buggy \- doesn't catch them all\).

Maybe reading for ADHDers with big pages of text are a problem coz we're processing EVER\-Y\-THING on a page unconsciously \(I.e. Supermarket aisles \- u feelin me!?\). 

You cut out that info, allowing for focus on 1 thing at a time, and it makes a world of difference. I am autistic and dyslexic so when the text is too small everything jumps around a lot. I can read an e reader far better than a standard text book. I make the text bigger and the Kindle paperwhite is high contrast black and white screen I can easily see. I have rediscovered my joy of reading since having my Kindle Paperwhite reader. I have the Kindle Fire but the contrast is not nearly as high as the Paperwhite.

The larger print allows one idea to express itself. When I see too much on a page my cognitive systems overload and shutdown. Flipping the pages faster helps motivate me because; I feel like I am progressing. Flipping the pages fast just happens because I get more immersed in the story.  When there is a LOT of text on the page I am more involved in managing the cognitive challenges of the autism and the dyslexic challenges of keeping the letters from jumping around on the page. With fewer large print words on a page there is less to manage and less to jump around and confuse so I focus more on the actual story. Your mileage may vary, I suppose.

I’m a somewhat experienced reader now (I read 100 books last year, no joke) so I read at a fairly fast pace in multi-word chunks. I prefer to put the margins on my Kindle as narrow as possible, with the smallest possible font size, which makes it easy for me to scan the chunks of words really quickly. That’s just for non-fiction though. I read a lot more slowly and with more normal sized text if it’s fiction. 

I started getting into reading back in like 2012 and only did a handful of books a year. American Gods was one of them and I really enjoyed that one.  Wow, I'm adult ADHD \(and was just reading about [RSD](https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-how-to-treat-it-alongside-adhd/), which struck a chord\) \- I think you perfectly articulated my experience, I can totally relate to this. Yeah, I've tried this method, but my brain just does not process info like that, yet having the words larger means I can read faster than I ever could before, because there's less to process = less cognitive bottleneck.
