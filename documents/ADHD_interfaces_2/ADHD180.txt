Trying to finish an essay. Impossible to organize myself. So I got 500 words to go, but I've been stuck for the past 6 hours. I thought this would be the first time I delievered something with a good time margin, but I was wrong.  
Most of the writing was done this week because I got distracted with the reading and trying to filter out the information I needed. I find it so hard to figure out where to start and what I need to read, so I just read everything I manage. I just can't seem to organize myself around my work at all. Feeling a little frustrated right now. It's 2.18 am here.   
It's due tomorrow at 3pm, so it's not like I'm short on time.   
Does organizing yourself around your work get better with medication? Like, is it easier to do things in the correct order? Everything in my head and in my notes are a total mess.   
OH! And I can't seem to put what I know into words.. I kinda just know it. It's so difficult to convey it verbally or by text. I seem way  more stupid than I actually am.  
I'm getting medication in January and I really hope it helps with these issues. Would make my life easier.  
 What is it on... The paper that is...
Is it research or review ect. The amygdala's role in the processing of emotional stimuli. Review, sorta. Uggg late black Friday... there's a lot of cheap tricks for writing a paper fast but the variant changes depending on the type of paper...
