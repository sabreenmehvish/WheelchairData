After years of not knowing what was wrong with me, I was finally diagnosed with ADHD this past Thursday. (wall of text) Hi guys, new user here. this past Thursday, I went to my therapist for a routine session. She asked how I was doing and I told her still not well. Recently my Primary care doctor has been trying to perfect the dosage of Ativan I have been on for anxiety. Before that I was on Klonopin for anxiety. Neither of which worked. I have been unable to sit in one spot for more than 20 mins in over 10 years. Even watching my favorite TV show or playing video games was a challenge, let alone school work or jobs. I lost 3 jobs and failed out of 2 colleges because of it. My life was a mess. So after I told my therapist my current status, she asked me if I had ever thought of taking medication for ADHD. ADHD, I thought, why would I have that? She proceeded to explain to me that the symptoms I was describing were tell tale signs of ADHD. She then gave me a preliminary questionnaire that, if answered a certain way, would lead to a diagnosis of ADHD. Well I failed with flying colors. My therapist took one look and giggled. She said "yep, go to your doctor with my notes and discuss medication." So I went to my primary care doctor and while she wants me to see a psychiatrist, she was nice enough to prescribe me meds! She put me on Adderall 10mg IR once a day. Wow. Thats all I can say. Wow. I feel like a new person. I can focus. My anxiety is cut in a quarter at least. Its in my opinion, a miracle. I now know what all of you go through. I am glad I do. I look forward helping you all and hope I can come to you for help as well!  

**TLDR** I have finally been diagnosed with ADHD and got the help and medicine I need. Its awesome
 Awesome...Congrats :D

That said

New rule (really a suggestion, do not get hung up on the word rule please), If your post is only 300 words. You can't put wall of text in your title for you scare people from reading your post.

Instead if you feel the need to warn us you should just make sure to do TLDR, and try to break your 300 word, roughly 20 sentences into paragraphs with 5 to 7 sentences.

I say this for we had two wall of text posts warnings side by side and they were not that long, and another one saying I did read the FAQ.  You guys are being too hard on yourself and you are scaring away people who want to support you and be part of a great community.  And this is coming from a person who finds reading walls of texts without spacing due to dyslexia to be pure hell :P Before you settle on which medication you're going to take be sure to try them all... different meds work differently on different people  haha fair enough. I am over critical because I care way too much about my reddit appearance (even though I only have posted like twice :P). But thank you for the advice and support!  **TLDR** are the best thing ever for this reddit.  Do a TLDR at the start of your post and you will get people just upvoting you because you thought enough to do the little things.

Have you see the Dr. Barkley Videos yet?
