ADHD and reading troubles I am lucky with my ADHD because I love to read, and am really, really good at it. Reading fiction for me is something that I can hyperfocus on, and books are a way that I procrastinate. 

My brother is the opposite. He has adhd and cannot focus on a book. He'll pick it up and his eyes just glaze over it.... I want to help him to like reading, but I don't know how because it comes naturally to me.

Is there anyone here who disliked reading when they were younger, and learned to like reading? Do they have any tips I can pass to my brother? (he's 14)  Maybe it's a certain type of book? Maybe he doesn't like the genre that you picked for him? I have adhd and no idea if my own brother has it. We're about 10 years apart and when he was 9 or so, (he does the same yours does, glaze over and stuff) and he really enjoyed Ender's Game and from there picked up more reading. He never read as much as I did but when he did pick up a book, he'd read a really good one. I can relate to your brother, I just can't stand to focus on a book. **"TL;DR"** is totally the story of my life (and probably your brothers too) so I enjoy short Poetry. Try some with your brother, he might like it! Then again, he may never *like* reading because some people simply don't like it and it's as simple as that.

In order to get through it when **NOT READING is not an option** he could try a text to speech program such as **[Kurzweil 3000](http://www.kurzweiledu.com/products.html)**. I find it's helpful because you can follow along with the highlighted text - a bouncing ball kind of thing- while the program reads to you. It has a number of other tools specifically designed for people with disabilities in mind. This program may be beneficial to look into.

Another option of course is the audio book, personally I have to read along with the book in order to stay focused, but not everyone is in the same boat. I still do not love to read, as nice as it would be to say that I do, that's is not who I am and I have a feeling that's not who your brother is either.  Instead of giving him a book, just start with a chapter, or even a page if that's too much. Sometimes it's the pressure of the volume that makes reading difficult.  In general, I love sitting down and reading a good book. When I am not medicated, however, I only enjoy the idea of reading a book of my choice. I find myself having to read and re-read sentences over and over again in order to retain and organize what I am reading. If you're familiar with the 'suicide' exercise, I'd say that's a good way to think about it, only you'd insert a sentence between the distance of each line you run to. One symptom of Inattentive ADHD is the inability to maintain sustained mental effort once it has been initially exerted. Another symptom is difficulty organizing stimulus input. The combination of both of these characteristics could be why he simply reads (or glances) over reading material. If you want to make reading enjoyable for him, break it up into conceptually based chunks and have him summarize in a sentence or two what he just read. If he enjoys art and/or drawing, have him create little pictures to go along with each chunk as he reads. These tools will help to stimulate him enough so that it captures his interest. Pictures and self-created summaries will also require him to organize what he's reading in a conceptual manner by tapping into his creativity. This is a skill he can use as a way of adapting to his given diagnosis.  It's fine. He can do the same it just takes a few minutes to get into it.

I'm the same way, i tend to just glaze over stuff and get distracted for a few minutes and then i'll probably completely zone the rest of the world out for a few hours. I'd say definitely he just needs to find the right genre, or the right book.

I always loved to read too, but my brother (4 years younger) didn't start as a big fan.  My dad and I are both diagnosed ADHD and I would say my brother has it too, but he has never been to a doctor about it/doesn't plan to.

When he was...7 or 8, my mom gave up trying to get him to read specific things and told him we weren't leaving the library until he picked two books that he wanted and that he would read. He picked two, we left, he read them.

That was a long time ago, so I can't remember at what age he got into the following, but maybe your brother will take to any of these:

* Hardy Boys series
* Soup (series by Robert Newton Peck)
* Harry Potter (he loved, I loved)
* Tom Clancy books
* Nancy Drew (my books, but he liked mystery, thought she was a know-it-all however)

You could also suggest:
* Goosebumps books
* Redwall books
* Artemis Fowl
* The Outsiders

The second list is from what I remember my male friends reading in junior high.

Honestly, most required reading from grade school sucked, and I could see how it makes more kids bored with reading.

Depends on his reading level too.  If he is behind the average 14 year old reading level, have him read something "younger" to start.  If reading is hard and you already hate it, you won't enjoy it.

Bring him to the library or bookstore, tell him to pick out two books that sound interesting.  You can also ask the librarian/someone in the store for suggestions for boys his age who dislike reading.  Don't give up on his reading!   [deleted] You can always mute the sound, set the program to a steady speed and read along to the highlighted words. I found that the bright yellow visual que can keep my eyes on the page for longer.... Not to say I didn't get lost in thought every now and then.  But audiobooks are usually more appealing, aren't they?
