Medication and socializing Does anyone else feel the need to text people and friends whenever they take their adhd meds. Every time I do I end up texting people who I haven’t seen or talked to in a long time.  Yes! When I was taking medicine this past summer I always felt the need to text people I haven’t spoke to in a long time. A couple hours later I almost always regretted it. Over time I learned to stop myself. But in my case, the people I would text are people I care about so I guess that’s a good thing. lol it's like you can finally remember to text ppl back... I mean who cares if I was supposed to text them back... 3 years ago.  I got around to it! Tbh it’s more like I should be socializing w these people anyway but sometimes I choose to ignore their msgs. But yeah I do the same thing, most of the time, they are nice convos. Haha "speed" texting instead of drunk texting! Yep! Bff and I call it "feelin' chatty". Although I usually just bombard the people closest to me with messages, haven't really felt the urge to reach out to anyone else lol.  100% same here I text people who I care about who I haven’t spoke to for a while This comment made my day
