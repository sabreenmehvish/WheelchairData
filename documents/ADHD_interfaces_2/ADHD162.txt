Great study tool for those of you that read without reading. My meds help me make time to sit down and study, but if I have to read something that I've already read or something that's really dry, I read without reading. I can go over pages and pages without comprehending a thing. 

Last night I found this site called [spreeder.com](http://www.spreeder.com) , it's supposed to be a free training tool that helps you teach yourself how to speed read. 

You can choose whatever and how much text you want to use with the program, then you can set it up so that 1 word or 2 words or however many words you want appear on the screen, and you can set the speed they appear and the font/size.

I've learned that having one word at a time going really fast reminds me to stay focused on the topic, the constant changing of words keeps my brain from getting bored. 

Only downsides are that it has to be in a digital format and I forget to blink.

TL;DR Found awesome way to study boring things, wanted to share it with you guys. I'll have to try this but idk part of my problem is dyslexia when it comes to speed, but thank you. Gotta try this nice share.   I love you for this This is epic, I can read a page @ 2.5x now, although concentration is a must while using this. Oh my god this thing is amazing. I'm reading at 500 wpm right now. I'm reading full passages crazy fast and understanding everything.
