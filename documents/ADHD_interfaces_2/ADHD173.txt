Social Impairment I find it hard to make and maintain friends with ADHD. For example I forget to answer messages.

Do you also have issues with that? I feel like we don't talk about this enough. For me the RSD is the biggest social impairment ADHD brings me. It’s caused me to lose quite a few friends, especially when my ADHD first really manifested.  I wish I could say that my social issues are entirely a result of ADHD, but they aren't.

I'm awkward, aloof, and have few friends.  I'm working hard to improve... but progress is slow.  I'm sure I'll get there one day, but I still have a long road ahead. I’ve had troubles with this, but one thing that’s helped has been to set aside some time each day to respond to texts and messages. Like before bed, or during a lunch hour. I’ve also explained to others that I’m not a great texter but directly told them I still feel affection towards them and will do my best to respond, and that generally helped smooth over some of my communication issues! Just tell them you're awful at texting back, they shouldn't take it personally then. A good habit to induce would be to only READ the message when you're able/willing to reply to it.. :)
