Does finding it hard to text and express through words, relate to ADD? I've recently been diagnosed with ADD and im exploring which aspects of my life is affected due to ADD. 

I have never really enjoyed texting as I find it so hard to explain what I mean. When I am writing I feel like its just word vomit on a page because I find it so hard to get the thoughts from my head and type them out. I find a similar thing with writing but not so much.

Whenever I read stuff back after I've sent it there are countless mistakes, even if I try to read over it before I send it. I have no idea how people manage to understand me. 

Is this something relating to ADD or other people have experienced? I have a friend who is like this, but her inability to communicate well through text ended up being a symptom of her dyslexia, not the ADHD. 

It might be worth exploring if you’ve got a partner mental health issue that’s being overlooked because it *looks* like its source is something you’ve already been diagnosed with, rather than acknowledging/managing a different root-cause.  Hey! I have ADHD-PI (is that what you mean by "ADD"?) and definitely experience this in moments of intensity, like someone asking me a stressful question. BUT that's more verbal, and for the most part, situational. 

Never happens in texts. [deleted] Just chill out and think about what you're typing.  Sometimes my mind goes faster than my mouth and I mumble.  Powerful minds have that problem.  You just have to learn how to let your thoughts flow slow enough so you can type/talk clearly. I guess that is worth thinking about. Thanks for your response! Hello, im not sure what what ADHD-PI is but I mean inattentive ADHD. That's quite interesting, I find it hard to work under any sort of pressure to, like if someone is asking me a mental maths question, my brain just stops completely - not sure if you're the same! That must be frustrating having that Knowledge. Is it like a feeling that you can't think of the words to express it? I'll definitely give this a try. I get that in exams that my head thinks so much faster than I can write, and if I don't write it fast enough, its gone and forgetten for ever haha Totally! MENTAL MATH IS SLOW DEATH > I'll definitely give this a try.

Same here.  Another problem is my handwriting is terrible.  If I write everything down quickly, I won't be able to read it.  Have you considered meditation?  I'm sure your campus has free classes. Yeah, I've been doing a lot the past few months whilst I haven't been at uni. Maybe I find some surprising benefits when I start working and writing again > Yeah, I've been doing a lot the past few months whilst I haven't been at uni.

Indeed.  How old are you?  It takes time to hone your skills and if you're 20-25 or college age - I have a decade more experience getting used to certain aspects of ADHD.  Having said that, you have to learn not to stress.  Meditation - IMO is something I should have taken up years ago.  👍
 Yeah I'm early 20s. I love mediation. I can really feel the benefit and I have so much more insight to my thought and feelings and so much more the learn !
