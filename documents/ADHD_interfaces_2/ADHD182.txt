Squirrelit, we need to talk... It's about your walls of text... I have the solution! Frustrated your **wall of text isn't getting the attention it deserves?** If you make life easier on the readers, they will reward you. No one wants to waste a long time only to find out the text they're reading is boring or useless, so people tend to skip long walls of text.

For **long text posts**:

- Break it up into **paragraphs**. Please.

- Give us a **TL;DR** (Too Long; Didn't Read) - **quick summary** - either on top or on the bottom

- **Bolden key words** in your post so that people can **skim the text** to get the main ideas

- **Lists** are your friend

-------------------------------

For **videos**:

- If the video is **longer than 10 minutes** (and even otherwise), please **post a summary** of the content in the thread.

- Use a **descriptive title** - don't use something like "Wow, I had never seen this video before"

-------------------------------

For **questions**:

If you want all your questions answered,

- **Separate them out** from the rest of the content spatially

- **Number them** - this ensures that people don't miss any of them

- Make them as **concrete** as possible

-------------------------------

**TL;DR** - make your post easy to read and easy to skim. Give summaries of videos. Make questions easy to find and address.

I hope this post serves as a guide - both in the information presented and in the manner in which it was presented.

**See the difference?**

You can **remember the points presented** much better in the **first example**, right?

[X-post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1ss3j3/recommendations_for_posting_walls_of_textother/) Don't think I can upvote this enough. Solid guide! I hereby proclaim this the "format bible" of r/ADHD


Seriously, there are so many well written articles on here that I just CAN'T read because of the format. This needs to be in the side bar. I'd love to see this posted in the sidebar. calling us squirrelit is cute, but now I am sad :( I didnt take my meds (late start this morning) and never noticed how much format made a difference in what I read. Ha neat. Oh man, I posted an enormous thing recently which I'm definitely going to reformat using thus.  I hadn't thought about the break lines and bold font. This hits right on the spot. I can't believe the number of posts in this subreddit that are breakless walls of text. 

Other suggestion: word limit? Seconding that this should be in the sidebar. Glad you think so! :-D

It's always great when you can improve yourself and the community at the same time :-) https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=don%27t%20be%20sad%20get%20glad&go=&form=QBIL&qs=n :-D

And, hey, as long as you get a start! :-)  :-D Right?

Agreed. Actually, *I sincerely wish that the Reddit interface allowed for a word/character limit* but apparently this is not the case. Maybe we should consider making these the rules. Worth considering.

I seriously tend to skip at least 60% of all posts because they don't work with my ADHD. Hmm. Perhaps Twitter is the perfect platform for ADHD discourse. It's the best form for [**all discourse**](http://www.aaanything.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Social_sites_explained.jpeg)
