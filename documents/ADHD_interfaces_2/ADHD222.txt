Depression and ADHD So I have adhd and I have temporary depression due to losing a gf who also had adhd (we fed off of each other's energy a lot). How did you guys get through this? I know there's somewhat of a common occurrence for individuals with ADHD to also have depression, either chronic or acute.  i JUST went thru this..

all i can say is stay outside, out of your house..youll just sit there and stew. take walks, go see a band, get new sneakers, remember who you were before the relationship..also delete all her texts you saved, delete her number, and stop following her social media, and doooooont call/text her...you can spazz out on other stuff rather than feeling down. let your adhd be a GIFT rather than a burden..if you can wrap your head around that one.. chin up homie. Kind of already did the calling and texting thing too much. She doesn't want to talk again but it could have been worse.  but it wasnt worse, you are good.
let her be, which is killing you i bet...
but remember INDIFFERENCE makes the difference.
ignore her completely. if she calls you, let it go to vm...then wait a handfull of hours to call her back, or text.
 give her a chance to miss your guts..all the while build yourself back to who u were before/are. i dunno about you, but i lose myself in relationships, and thats the worst thing we can do. just wacko advice...take it or leave it. Certainly true. I thank you for it. It's actually been a month or so but we're both in stressful points in our lives.
