Need some helpful advice with reading. Hi guys I'm on mobile and this is one of my first texts posts so please be gentle.

I have a question, I have been struggling with ADHD since I was diagnosed from a young age (I'm 23 now and was diagnosed when I was I think 6). I have always had trouble reading. I read at a college level but when I read I have to constantly go back and re read pages because I instantly forget what I just read or I forget who characters are in the story. So my question is how do you maintain focus when reading and do y'all have any tips when it comes to reading with ADHD? Thank you. Time pressure does help me focus on the reading. Other than that, i try to find the audiobook for the book i have to read. It's pretty easy to find free audiobooks if your reading stuff like Shakespeare, plays, etc. i would listen to it with my book in hand and follow. This helps me a lot to not get too distracted. 

My biggest problem is that i have bad memory. I dont remember much of what i read, so what i do sometimes is, I get post-it notes and whenever i find a passage that might be important. I would write a small summary of it on the post-it. It doesnt have to be super elaborate, it could be a sentence or two words. Then, I'll just stick it right on the passage. So, if i ever have a quiz or test or an essay to write. I just flip through the book and just read the post-it and I'll start remembering what i read. If i really have no clue of what happened in the book after that small summary, I'll read that one page and it usually comes back.

Edit: some grammar mistakes. Sorry im on mobile.
