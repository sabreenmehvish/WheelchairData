Advice for reading with ADHD/ADD? Does anyone have any advice for reading? I struggle so much, to the point where I just avoid reading entirely. Every time I sit down and read I just cannot focus and I end up having to re-read sentences and paragraphs and even then I don't take in the information. I'm worried because I'm supposed to be starting uni in September to study biology (I dropped out last year because I couldn't deal with the work). I don't want to fail again because of this problem.  It doesn't help for physical books, but for reading on the PC at least I totally recommend [Beeline Reader](http://www.beelinereader.com/) - it's been so damn helpful personally, I've found it has really reduced the problem where I read a paragraph then realise I wasn't 'listening' to myself at all so I needed to reread it (again and again), and it helps with just following along in general. Such a small thing and it's so good. I don't usually have reading trouble but when I do it is as you describe.  I sometimes use a heavy sheet of paper to underline the sentence I am on and block below.  Helps me focus. * Read in the morning. Your brain may be clearer because it isn't as full of distracting thoughts.

* Meditate before you read.

* Edit your texts. Underline important passages. Sum up paragraphs briefly on top of the page. Give parts your own headlines if they don't have any. Write down topics as key words on the margin. 

* Pay close attention to the first and last sentence of the paragraph. Often the first sentence introduces a new thought and the last one is the conclusion.

* Summarize your readings in a word file.

* If you keep drifting off because the writing is bad, get a better book. Academic texts are full of bad prose containing too many abstract nouns, too many nominalizations, passive constructions, and lots of clutter. 

* If you have to read a text that is ADHD unfriendly because of its  cluttered academic prose, simplify it. Cross out unnecessary words and replace opaque words with simple ones. Make long sentences short and comprehensible. Take notes while you read.  Seriously.  It's not entertaining, but it'll keep you focused and provide you with good study material later. Try to summarize each section (bullet points, not sentences), and come up with 1-2 questions about the section to ask your prof.  (Profs WILL usually cut you more slack if they see you are engaged with the class and putting in the work.  This CAN save your ass later.)

Also, try to avoid marathoning your reading- set aside 20-minute sessions throughout the day to work on your reading.

If you are a social sort, joining a study group could also help. Thanks for sharing this information about the app
