Any tips on how to improve "thought-to-text" skills? It's gotten worse, and now I feel like I can't find the right words to use in general.    
I have not had an issue with learning vocabulary or understanding words, but it feels like the previous "flow of thoughts" that became a foggy-yet-understandable space, and now it's about as difficult to get thoughts onto paper as it would be to understand a physics textbook without learning any prerequisite courses.    
Hell, it's even making this post a challenge to type up!    
I may not be sleeping enough recently (5-7 hours), so maybe that's part of the problem?    
Any advice?  Luckily this isn't a ADHD specific issue, many people struggle with putting things into words. Vocabulary is key, read quality texts. Stuff that tabloid clickbait shit in the trash and pick up a good fiction book or some proper journalism/opnion (The New Yorker is a favourite of mine).  

Secondly, and the best thing you can do is to practice writing. In some serious workshop classes I've been to, there is an exercise called "[free writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing)" its super easy and I've definitely become a better writer for it. 

If you can discipline yourself nothing beats keeping a journal. Great for your writing, self-growth, happiness pretty much fucking gold if you ask me. [This is a cool way to do it](http://750words.com) but I just use pen and paper. 

[Here's](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/04/famous-writers-on-keeping-a-diary/) some of the greats (Plath, Woolf, Emerson Sontag) on why to write a journal.  Well, sleep, yes.  I did some ace writing this morning, 15 minutes after I woke up, after a 9 hour sleep.  I struggled to write at school, but once I learned to touch-type it changed my life.  I went from someone who couldn't finish a basic writing task to writing whole electronic newsletters in an afternoon.  Writing by hand, sleep deprived, is near impossible for me.  Reading certainly makes writing better.  Like touch-typing, once I managed to get to a decent reading speed it also changed my life.  Writing good 'spontaneously', I believe,  can get better when you chat with a group of people in a chat room, who also write well and have wit.  It's also engaging so it keeps helping you improve. Yeah, get more sleep dude.  The brain fogs get way worse when I haven't had enough sleep, especially after a few nights in a row of it.  Get exercise later in the afternoon if you can, it might help wear you out a bit more to be tired and sleep better.

  As for writing/expressing things.  Maybe it's not the writing that's the problem as such, maybe it's the pool from which youre trying to draw expression from i.e your vocabulary.  You done much in the way of reading lately?  Doesn't have to be anything difficult like peer-reviewed technical articles.  Maybe a Novel, a novella, comics, short stories?  Reading can help with expanding vocabulary, so maybe reading (if your brain can handle bits at a time at least) might help if you take some time off trying to express things and just absorb some new stuff. For me the issues with putting down information is that I am taking a great deal of time thinking about what I am going to say. It could be because I am too hyped up about the topic so I put more effort into putting information down more meaningful, maybe I am trying to make it perfect right off the bat, or maybe I simply struggle finding the proper wording to correctly articulate my thoughts.

What ever the cause, it makes me become stuck on one phase involved in putting down information. A possible solution? Stop caring so much about what you are putting down... Try not to get so hyped up over what you need to communicate and find a balance between being excited about the topic at hand and simply not caring if what you are putting down is right or wrong.

Try this: the next time you have a to communicate something (a paper/essay) start off by putting down what ever comes to mind about the topic. It does not matter if its good or bad, or makes sense... just dont be afraid of going off topic right now. Just start putting down something. What you think of the topic. What color it could be. What you think would be cool to write... anything. I had a few problems through school with this, and over time ended up taking on a "sarcastic" tone when writing papers for school. It actually helped me to do pretty well, and I only ever had one teacher not like my writing. I went about this through sometimes re-stating things, pretending that it should be *so obvious* that a literary feature is available in the text. If it were something besides English, I just wrote it out how I would normally say it,  then go back and edit the heck out of it later, making sure I actually make sense and didn't get *too* informal.  

I hope this helps. EXERCISE - most important, especially high-cardio (running, skipping, swimming, martial arts, dance) if you can.
Sleep, diet. Get the fundamentals down. They can help your enormously. Also meditation/yoga can be incredibly effective. Read "Getting Things Done". Best self organization and ~~now~~ note taking book I've ever read. #####&#009;

>__Free writing__ is a [prewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewriting) technique in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without regard to spelling, grammar, or topic. It produces raw, often unusable material, but helps writers overcome blocks of apathy and self-criticism. It is used mainly by [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose) writers and writing teachers.   Some [writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers) use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as [automatic writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing).

>Unlike [brainstorming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind.

I can see how reading some higher level material could improve my response pool size, and I have not read much book-wise for the past few years, so it's not hard to believe that they will help.    
After a longer sleep time last night, I can already feel the fog clearing up! Would you think that your advice can also apply to talking with someone else as well? I'll try to use this advice for writing things though; it sounds like a great idea! I do the same thing with every piece of writing in school now, unless it's a research paper. It helps because it's much easier to speak out of my mind, rather than hope I keep all the built-up info stored while I revise the current sentence in my head. It doesn't use a big vocabulary, so it isn't "intellectual" enough for official writing assignments; it is the one issue I am aware of regarding this. I'm trying to keep up the daily neighborhood run routine, and it's sort of helping? I'm not sure if the change is immediate, or gradual, or if the change is a huge, or moderate one?    
I've been trying to get back to at least 10:30PM as my regular time to sleep, so I get at least 8 hours. It's getting there, slowly.    
Now, I've heard that meditation can help from a lot of the people here, and I'd be glad to try it out, but I am not sure where to start out with it. Any recommendations? Attempting to express your thoughts vocally to another individual is different than if you were to write them down. In my suggestion the idea behind it is not caring about what your write down, how you write it down, or how coherent it is. You simply don't care because your just putting down what comes to your mind about the subject. Once you get that first part out of the way, you at least have something to work with... then the rest just flows from that much more easily.

If you were apply that same technique to speaking to someone else... well being coherent is much more important when you are talking :P

The right level of coherency comes with being confident in yourself on a higher emotional state then what you need if you were writing. You must not have doubt in yourself and be versed enough on the topic you are bringing up to talk about the subject at hand and be able to branch off to other topics. You also have to be confident in yourself so if you do say something wrong, you have the ability to quickly fix what you say or just continue on knowing you misspoke. It seems to me that with confident speakers... they first learn how to speak correctly then learn how to speak intelligently :o There's a good app called 'Simply Being' if you're interested in trying it in your own time. I'm sure there are other great ones as well as this. It's good because you can start off just doing 5 minutes a day, then build it up from there. Personally I find going to a guided class is better - you will definitely do an hour if you go to a to a class, but it's a bit harder to motivate yourself if you do it on your own. I found meditation pretty difficult when I first started, but it gets better and easier the more you do it. I'm pretty confident with what I say now, and it's probably to do with my "not giving a shit" attitude (politely, of course) when it comes to dealing with negative things, to help with self-esteem. I do tend to get a bit embarrassed internally after I say something incorrectly, but I am working on that. I have been attempting to fix that feeling, and improve the accuracy and quickness of the mistake correction process, so it's getting better!
