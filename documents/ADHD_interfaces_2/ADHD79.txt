What techniques have you developed to help you concentrate at studying or reading? That don't required any type of meds/drugs. Listening to electronic music that has no voices and repetitive beats with headphones helps me zone into whatever I'm working on. I've been doing this since I can remember and its possibly the best thing so far. I used to be prescribed adderall 2 x 30 mg/day and that didn't work as well. Without the music I go through paragraphs of text and at the end would be like.... what did I just read, having to read it again and again... 

What things have you developed to fully concentrate? Without using meds...  Working in the morning, before all the hustle and bustle of the day  Just find something that you can do in a constant motion. Like the foot shake. Or like for u, music. Listening to chillstep, being alone and choosing the right environment. Having a clean home or going to the library helps a lot. Also high doses of caffeine. I usually find electronic or instrumental music to be too distracting or even irritating for anything that requires sustained focus. But binaural beats or unintrusive nature sounds tend to work quite well for me. I'm glad that one works for you!! Tried it a couple of times and my focus or hyperfocus usually works better at 3 am.  For me it's working at night when the world goes quiet. Foot shake +1, that is good when taking tests and headphones are not allowed.  

Is there a study that shows constant motion helps with focus?  I can relate. The lofi youtube channels are amazingly good. Theres also a playlist in spotify thats called ADHD Hyper Focus, that thing is amazing.  Also, clean room and caffein is a must everyday.  Not sure if theres a study, just speaking from experience.
