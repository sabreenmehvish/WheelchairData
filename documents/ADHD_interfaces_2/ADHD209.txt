Digital Tools for Mental Organization: OneNote - Mini-Review Personally, when it comes to basic "To Do" lists, I prefer pen and paper even though I'm surrounded by screens all day. But when it comes to organizing a complex project I need a more powerful digital tool.

After trying dozens of software packages and apps over the last few years, I discovered there are a lot of different approaches and some pretty terrific tools from Trello on down. However, when I need something deeper than a linear list or list of lists, I've settled on OneNote from Microsoft (a part of Office 365). Here's why:

**Big Upside**
  
OneNote can work the way I think because it supports 'outlining'. This is a feature that lets me essentially make bullet lists of topics, then add indented sub-bullets under each bullet, and then sub-bullets under those. Any bullet can then have entire paragraphs of text, images or media added underneath it. Of course, a word processor can do something similar but a real outlining tool keeps a hidden organization structure around these bullets which lets us then optionally collapse each level of bullets so none of the bullets or paragraphs underneath that level are visible. Yet we can have lots of levels and lots of layering of those levels. Because it keeps a hierarchical structure around all this, it makes it easy to then drag and drop bullets, paragraphs or whole levels around and even move them to different branches in the hierarchy.

I find this kind of capability essential for my non-linear way of thinking. It lets me quickly blurt out an unstructured sequence of disorganized thoughts and ideas then easily go back through and drag them into a more coherent nested structure.

As the sheer quantity of stuff grows I can easily collapse things down so it doesn't get overwhelming seeing it all at once. I can see my stuff at only the level of detail I'm interested in at the moment with other details hidden, yet it's quick to dive in and expand an area to add more thoughts without getting distracted by all the other stuff I've already captured. Hiding or exposing large swaths of detail with one-click is a killer feature.

This kind of deeply structured, nested and collapsible outlining used to be a more popular feature in other tools but support in the last few years has been waning. Many tools still support some kind of outlining but it's often not infinitely deep, truly structured,  arbitrarily collapsible and drag-and-drop while maintaining the structure within just about any kind of visual layout (columns, colors, fonts, tables and rich formatting). Also, I really value broad support for photos, diagrams, screen grabs, video and even HTML anywhere in the hierachy.

**Smaller Upsides**

* It's really powerful and mature because it's been around a long time.
* It works on Windows, Mac, IOS, Android and Web. Desktop, tablets, phones and cloud though the Windows version is still the best and deepest. 
* It's super extensible with scripting and plug-ins for those that want to dive in.

**Negatives**

* It can be complex if you're used to really simple mobile / web 2.0 type tools that are fast, simple and limited.
* Versions on mobile platforms don't quite have all the same features but they are fine for viewing and editing what you've created on desktop.
* It costs money though the subscription and edu pricing can keep it pretty reasonable.
