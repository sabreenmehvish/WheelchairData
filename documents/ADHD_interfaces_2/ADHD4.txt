I was wondering if my ability to retain information and read blocks of texts extremely fast is a result ADD. I have clinically diagnosed ADD, and I have noticed recently a natural ability to read extremely fast, and retain information at the same time. I was wondering if my fellow reADHDers experience the same thing or if this is just a natural gift of mine?

Never give up guys, we deal with failure on a daily basis, but ingrain in your head to never give up. (I don't know why I told you guys this, but I just had a compelling urge to lol) 51 yo here - I think those of us who are lucky enough to actually enjoy reading naturally develop speed-reading abilities. We skim and pick up context easily.

Note that this only seems to apply to reading things I *enjoy* - otherwise I feel I'm nearly in the camp that so many others complain about, having to stop and reread every damn sentence over and over again, missing crucial information *anyway*, etc. I'm the same way. I can read giant blocks of text and pull the gist of the information really quickly. Often if I'm trying to show something to a co-worker they will say things like "Whoa hold on there! Go back to the last page. How the heck did you read that so fast?" so it's amusing :). Helps a lot when I'm searching technical documents for pertanent information. ADHD is typically associated with poor reading comprehension, so most likely no. After starting vyvanse I have been enjoying reading...I did notice I am reading faster and re-reading less...not just material I am interested in either. I have the same, although because of the very same ADHD I don't read much.

I'm trying to make it a habit actually now, to read for at least an hour a day, and just make it something I have to do, because I could potentially be devouring books (I did at times).

The skill has proven useful at time though, like when scanning texts for typographic mistakes, or words to be replaced etc. (wasn't actually aware that it was due to this)
