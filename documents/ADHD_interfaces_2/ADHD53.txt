Trouble reading textbooks Hey all, first time poster here. I've been treating my ADHD since grade 3 and I'm now 20. I recently started college and I'm struggling a lot to stay focused when reading my art history text book. My mind just wanders and I don't pay attention to what I'm reading (if that makes sense). Does anyone else struggle with this? If so, what have you done to help? Try adding music or fidget toys. Something to distract toe low functions of your brain. But still do this alone and without complex distractions like TV or computers or phones that are likely to take your higher attention away. (i find headphones and music I love the best way to concentrate)

Use pomadoro techniques to break up the monotany if you have a lot of reading to do. Then, if you need to go further, interspace a pom of art history with one of a radically different subject: science or math or something less ready more think. Then go back.  Towards the end of the chapter there are usually summaries and key points.  I would start there to get a brief overview.  Even at the end of sections there's usually a reinforcement paragraph that sums up what's really important.  I'm a hypocrite bc I am stuck on feeling the need to read a chapter from start to finish.  

If you can download phone apps there are study timers that segment your studying into short periods with breaks in between.  Also, I would try to tell yourself you'll just read 2 pages (or 5...or one paragraph even) at a time and then break for a little bit.  Allow your body and mind to rest but only briefly.   Your school should have a disability office. 

Ask them.  ADHD isn't recognized as a learning disability here. [deleted] Alberta, Canada Blaming Canada is a solid.

I dunno. It is a learning disability. More information would help.
