ADHD and Memory **Background:** 

I'm a 23 year old male attending university. I first heard of ADHD when I was 11 from my elementary school teacher. I was very aware that my mind wanders around a lot, I was very hyper, and I had to be told multiple times to do one thing. But at the time, I thought this was normal.

 At age 13, I had a class with a kid who had ADHD and was on medication. Our classmates didn't like him too much and thought of him as "that annoying kid" because he had these tendencies such as talking too much with no filter among many others. I realized that I had the same tendencies but I was well liked among my peers so nobody ever picked on me for it. I would say that this is the first time I  made a self-diagnosis but I kept it to myself since every classmate claimed they had ADHD when they didn't feel like doing their work. 

When I was 18, I got into a 4 year university away from home. My academics up until this point were fine. When I first got to college, my grades did drop a little. Out of curiousity, I decided to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist to find out if in fact I had what I thought I had. The psychologist asked me to bring my report cards from elementary school and a parent for her to interview about my childhood behavior. I brought all 36 copies of my progress reports/report cards from elementary school (K -5, 6 a year, all hand written) and I brought my father. The psychologist was surprised to find that all 36 report cards contained one of the following: 

* AgentJohnGarrett is easily distracted, he needs to learn how to not disrupt the class.
* AgentJohnGarrett needs to focus better in class and spend more time on his work.
* AgentJohnGarrett needs to pay more attention in class and not distract his peers. 

The psychologist was so surprised to see the same comments be repeated over and over again on all 36 report cards. She asked my dad, "Really? You've never thought about getting him tested before now?" To which my dad replied, "What are we testing him for again?"

At age 21, I was prescribed medication for ADHD. Prior to that, I have never taken any. I was offered a prescription when I was 18 but I decided to hold off on it for as long as I felt like I could manage my classes. At this point, I felt as if my engineering courses had become overwhelming. 

 
**Memory:**

I've heard many times on this subreddit that people have had problems with their memory. Short term memory, long term memory, all sorts. I realized that medication had very little effect on my memory. A common example that I've heard is misplacing their phone, keys, and wallet. This rarely happens to me because my parents made me get into the habit of placing all my stuff in the same drawer whenever I get home. Something more relatable to me is going upstairs to grab my laptop charger and I'll come back down with everything but a charger. It would take me multiple trips up and down the stairs before I walk into my room and finally recall that I came up to grab my charger. 

In terms of reading textbooks, I would have to re-read each sentence a few times before it clicks in my brain. With medication, I might have to only re-read it 2 or 3 times. Then I have to re-read the entire paragraph with our without medication. It's interesting because there's a similar effect to when somebody says something to me. For example, my girlfriend would ask me something and I would have no response. To her, it seems like I'm ignoring her. But to me, it seems like I can hear every single individual word she said but I can't process the sentence as a whole. Sometimes, I would repeat the same words that she just said over and over again in my head until I can make sense of the question. (If this happens to you, have your SO tap you on the shoulder before they ask the question. It works wonders for getting your attention and allowing you to process it a little easier.)

So this is where it gets weird for me. Sometimes, I won't be able to process the question she asked after repeating it in my head a couple times. I'll ask her to repeat the question and she'll be annoyed and gives me a "nevermind." Of course the question isn't super important, otherwise she would repeat it. But some time later, maybe a couple hours, maybe the next week in class at 8 AM (it's happened before), I'll suddenly remember the question, process it without any effort, and I'll text her the answer. Some how, some way, my brain manages to recall information such as this for no apparent reason. 

In fact, it seems like my brain is great at remembering a lot of useless information. I can remember what the last thing my friend ate at my house a few weeks ago and which cup he used. I can remember that the first Snapple bottle cap fact that I ever read was *All polar bears are left-handed*. I can remember who's the last person who used the oven mitts during Labor Day 2013. My girlfriend will tell me stuff like her high school friend working for a certain biotech company. A year later, we're driving pass said biotech company and I'll point out that her high school friend works there.

In fact, sometimes I can remember parts of a conversation word for word. Sometimes, I'll be with a friend and I'll repeat to them the words that were said. I can remember when and where the conversation took place. The earliest memory that I have is when I was four. I can remember feeding pigeons at a park and a mother/daughter comes up to me to ask for bread crumbs. There's been times where I was stuck on a chemistry exam and I'm staring at the problem. Then I catch myself repeating what the professor said during lecture. Although it's very rare that I recall something this important and this helpful at such a critical time. Even then, it's happened a couple times. 

There's a lot more stuff I can come up with off the top of my head but I think you get the idea. My point is that my brain seems to store a lot of random useless crap. I'm not purposely trying to remember all these things. I don't choose and pick what I want to remember. A lot of times, I don't even know why I remember. Sometimes, I recall something so random and it's completely irrelevant to what I'm doing and I just blurt it out. It just appears in my head for no good reason. The medication doesn't make it any better or any worse. Unfortunately, my memory doesn't do this often enough when it comes to school and stuff I actually have to remember. I was wondering if anybody else had experienced this as well. 


**TL;DR - Random obscure memories appear in my head whenever it feels like appearing. e.g. first Snapple bottle cap fact I read in middle school. Does this ever happen to you? ** When I got evaluated by a neuropsychologist, one of the things he pointed out was that my 'working memory' was prone to losing information. But my actual longer-term memory worked just great, once the information got in there. He called it a "swiss cheese" sort of effect: there are holes you aren't even aware of in the knowledge being committed to memory. I feel like I sometimes have issues proccessing a piece of information: it will rattle around my brain until I can make sense of it, and think through the significance of it. You can tell when I am talking, because I often take long pauses mid-sentance to let the words sort of finish tumbling around in my head and come out. I am not always very good at thinking on my feet for that reason. Stuff either falls out of working memory entierly, or gets stuck in some lost corner somewhere, only to pop out again later and snap into place. **I commented in a post a month ago, and here is [what I said](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2j7d33/adhd_people_have_less_working_memory_how_so/cl94x2y) regarding ADHD and memory:**

I'm going from memory here (pun intended) but the basic rule is your maintenance rehearsal has 3 linear functions:

    Sensory Memory

    Short Term Memory

    Long Term Memory

Sensory memory is every stimuli your eyes are receiving, and because your eyes constantly shifting all over the place the bulk of that information is lost. This is normal for everyone.

The second stage is short term memory. Your conscious mind at this moment is paying attention to the sensory memory and it has 3 key aspects:

1. Limited Capacity - only about 7 (on average) items can be stored at a time.

2. Limited Duration - storage is very fragile and information can be lost with distraction or passage of time.

3. Encoding - primarily acoustic, even translating visual information into sounds.

Short term memory is sometimes interchangeable with the word we all know so well "working memory". However there is a noticeable distinction between the two because working memory refers to the processes that are used to temporarily store, organize and manipulate information. Whereas short term memory refers mainly to temporary storage. One analogy is RAM in your computer where it's actively loading memory for brief periods of time before it is no longer needed and finally flushed out. But if you have multiple programs running in the background and dozens of tabs on your webpage, your computer begins to run choppy and slow.

The third stage is long term memory. This is your unlimited memory or as long as you can remember it, and everyone is different of course. Duration might be a few minutes or a lifetime. Suggested encoding modes are semantic (meaning) and visual (pictorial) in the main but can be acoustic also. And this also has 3 key aspects:

1. Procedural memory is a part of the long-term memory is responsible for knowing how to do things, i.e. memory of motor skills. It does not involve conscious (i.e. it’s unconscious - automatic) thought is not declarative. For example: procedural memory would involve knowledge of how to ride a bicycle.

2. Semantic memory is a part of the long-term memory responsible for storing information about the world. This includes knowledge about the meaning of words, as well as general knowledge. For example, London is the capital of England. It involves conscious thought and is declarative.

3. Episodic memory is a part of the long-term memory responsible for storing information about events (i.e. episodes) that we have experienced in out lives. It involves conscious thought and is declarative. An example would be a memory of our 1st day at school.

The process that occurs that allows you to remember things from your childhood to the name of the quarterback of your favorite team is during this maintenance rehearsal is the information is going from your sensory → short term → long term storage and there is also a time frame from where you remember it. And as I've said, everyone is different of course but I remember my psychology professor saying that it takes up to 20 seconds of sustained focus to something to go into your long term storage box.

Now an example of what all this means to an ADHD'er is think about when you're reading a book or studying for an exam. It becomes extraordinarily difficult trying to focus on one specific thing long enough for the short term storage to go to your long term storage because you're constantly being bombarded with distractions that you can't filter out. In my case it was not being able to remember the 1st thing I was focused on because by the 4th or 5th distraction within a 10 second interval I couldn’t remember the first thing I was focused on anymore, hence the broken neuron theory. While reading a book, it could easily have been a specific word from the middle of the paragraph that triggers me to think about someone, some place, or some thing, and it suddenly turns into a downward spiral of various thoughts coming in my head, not to mention the constant visual and audio stimuli that is also inundating me. At the same time I'll still be on auto pilot reading the chapter monotonously, even though all that information doesn't go past my short term storage, and by the time I finish the page I can't remember a single god damn thing what I just read. And god forbid you have a low tolerance for reading because I easily get bored or frustrated with having to read bullshit that doesn't engage me, or worse, forced to learn something that you have I understanding because it will further increase your frustration and failure. And this also occurs with projects and that simulate me, it never stops.

Then if it's studying for an exam, I literally have to write down cue cards for everything that required memorization, and put post it notes all over my desk so that I'm constantly forced to look at definitions and formulas. And as always, I'd remember what my professor said, 20 seconds... so I made sure I kept repeating the word or sentence in my head for 20 seconds or until I finally got it into my long term storage. At the time I didn't know I had ADHD but when I applied the cue cards, and repetition techniques I aced the class. The only difference is that it takes 3-4x longer to study than a normal person would because of the obvious distractions. Additionally, it explained why I did so terribly in English all those years because I couldn't remember anything from the chapter or book unless I went over it 3 times, but also the failure to learn new words and phrases from not reading exacerbated my anxiety when I couldn't articulate the proper english structure to express exactly what is on my mind at any moment, this lack of interest in reading affected writing abilities because I never actually did it. It literally took smoking Marijuana one day for me to appreciate reading, but that is a story for another time and I digress.

Now here is where things become tricky because unless you have ADHD, it's difficult to explain or replicate this thought process to a neurologist because it's like asking an alien who had never or could ever feel pain to describe what it feels like. It can read our text books and take an exam on the chemical process and biology, and I could do my very best to explain that it is not a good sensation, but it could never feel it. So for a neurologist, they can try to correlate cognitive memory malfunctioning to the low grey matter in the frontal cortex which is consistent with individuals diagnosed with ADHD, but it could equally be the case due to the fact the receptors can have more than one functions, hence why you can be impulsive and also have a learnign disability at the same time. Or it can also be the case of both or neither and it is some other underlying mechanism common in ADHD. See why it is so hard to peg down? Otherwise diagnosis wouldn't be a trivial 45 minute conversation with a pdoc and filling out a vague and arbitrary questionnaire before you are subjected to months of different medications before you're lucky enough to find the right one. The psychiatric industry is still in the dark ages I feel. For them to try and emulate or understand how my mind functions is impossible because they have no precedent to follow up on.

In conclusion because I'm completely tapped out of mojo, just think of your memory like a webpage and RAM, but in this case you don't have enough RAM and it is infected with malware pop-ups, and if you're trying to memorize someone's name or learn new material, it will be exceedingly difficult to do so if you have an over abundance of stimuli. You need to have a clear 20 second window to zero in on the specifics of the conversation/material because your working memory is unable to organize or manipulate that information in a manageable fashion and maintain that rhythm long enough for the short term memory storage to transfer to the long term memory storage. Up until now medication only helps with boosting my energy and motivation, but does nothing for the foggy memory. I can at least say that I can stay engaged long enough on something so that I can given the proper seconds so I can remember what is necessary even if it is a useless fact. Just ask me about Section 1021 of The National Defense Authorization, it's burned in my memory.

NOTE: I purposelfy did not proof read this so you folks can see what I'm talking about how my ADHD affect my grammar, run on sentences, delineated rants, and I'm pretty sure I got the facts wrong on certain things because I didn't double check myself. But hey, it's the price I pay to prove a point.

 This is literally my life. You know what happened last Friday? I asked someone a question I already asked them 3 times.

And I talk with this friend who's going to take driving class next semester, and I always warn him to not have this teacher because blah blah, and he pointed out to me I've told him that more than 3 times.

My first memory was a dream I had when I was 4. I was in this dark, maroon room, litted only with a fire in the fireplace. There were 2 guests, a couple, and my mother and I. My mom was changing my diaper under a maroon blanket. I felt embarrassed that the couple could see her changing my diaper.

I remember when I one time slept in my sisters room when I was 5. I was on the bottom bunk bed, and I just went to bed. Every night before bed, my brother and I would have a conversation (I still do to this day, because I'm a teenager and I still have to share a room with him). The one day I sleep with my sister instead of my brother, we don't have a conversation. She goes to sleep, and doesn't have a conversation with me. I cried myself to sleep.

I have more stories, but ironically enough, I can't remember any right now. Well I never really recall things that much but I know exactly what you're talking about when you can't process things.  It's exactly like I'm processing each word but not the sentence.  I stand there and think about what was just said and basically use context clues to figure things out.  It's terrible, I feel like I'm retarded when it happens and it depresses me because it shows just how little control I have over my own mind. I definitely feel like the same or similar happens to me. Though I recall very little of my childhood, I mean, I can hardly remember things that happened in high school and that was only 5 years ago, but I do have flashes I guess of memories from when I was younger that seem very clear. For example, in elementary school we used to play a "game" I giess you'd call it, basically we'd be walking in a line through a door and when the door was starting to close but you had enough time to get through you'd rush through it without touching it and let it close right behing you for the next person to have to open. I've got a very clear memory of doing that but with a teacher behind me, which I didn't realize until too late, and the teacher just giving me this very disappointed look. 

I also remember sitting on the bathroom floor with my knee cut opens ms bleeding everywhere and my mom freaking out, moment like that, but for the life of me most of my childhood is a blank, and the few things I do recall are actually just me remembering the stories I've been told, not the events themselves usually. 

I can however recall lore and events from video games and TV shows with ridiculous accuracy quite often, despite not having much of any desire to recall those things, from shows like Farscape, Stargate, starcraft, etc. but things I want to learn and memorize, like friends and parents birthdays, everything I've learned in college so far, what I have to do tomorrow, just don't stick at all. I'm at work so I can't respond fully but I will say that random memories are CONSTANTLY popping up in my head. Sometimes I can identify the completely tangential reason for it coming into my head, but a lot of the time it's just completely random. I also have a lot of trouble remembering conversations and reading dense materials. Holy shit. This is me, word for word. I feel like I need to print this out and bring it to my psychiatrist, because I can't describe the way my mind works as well as you have.

oh and "In fact, sometimes I can remember parts of a conversation word for word. Sometimes, I'll be with a friend and I'll repeat to them the words that were said. I can remember when and where the conversation took place." Plus what they were wearing head to toe. From 3 years ago. Get out of my brain This is exactly what happens to me in terms of working memory & long term memory. I'm awful on the spot, but long-term, as long as I can give meaning to something, (even as mundane as OP's example of "my girlfriend's highschool girlfriend works here") then I'm pretty much going to remember it forever. 

Although, to use OP's example again, whenever we pass the building some long-lost friend's mom used to work at that one time, and I point it out to my boyfriend, there's no real reason I'll tell him - I just say it 'cause it pops into my head. But then I'll forget that I've told him, and end up saying it EVERY TIME we pass that building. 

I know it annoys him - I keep repeating pointless anecdotes about people he doesn't know, and never will, and he'll have to hear it over and over again. He's put up with it for 5 years though, so now he just teases me about it or ignores it.
 Nice analogy with whole tabs and malware pop up thing. Anything that *you can* remember that may be the cause of this? My childhood memories are pretty limited, too. 

After speaking with a psychiatrist, I feel like I have comorbid ADD/PTSD, both of which I never considered until I did a lot of reflecting. Many of those with ADHD/ADD have multiple disorders---which makes sense (if part of your brain is 'different,' what's to say it doesn't affect more than XYZ?)

My PTSD (which is what I'll attribute this flaky memory symptom for now) probably comes from bullying and such. I never really made the connection, because I think of PTSD like a soldier's illness or something someone who was severely abused gets. But the brain can only handle *so* much, like our bodies can, I suppose.  Honestly idk what is to blame for my lack of memories. I was diagnosed with depression when I was, like, 14 or so, but it wasn't that severe, and while it still affects me sometimes, most of why I was diagnosed was probably due to being a teenager, hormones and all that. My mom has PTSD from an abusive home, but she made up for it with me, definitely had a good childhood myself, from what I recall anyways.

I do have a pain condition that I've had for as long as I can remember, the pain has just always been there, and the condition literally puts pressure on my brain, it's not supposed to have any neurological side effects though, so I can't say if it's the reason for my lack of long term memories or not.  It just bothers me that huge swaths of my life are essentially blanks for me, I know enough from friends and stories to know what things happened when, and I mean I recall the bigger things, but details elude me, I was in marching band for example, all 4 years of high school, I have vauge memories of long bus rides to away games, playing on crappy uneven football fields, long hours practicing in the summers. But I couldn't tell you what all 4 of our shows were, we did Chicago one year, but idk which, I played a piccolo duet in the superman song which was a part of one show, but again, I couldn't tell you which year that was or what the rest of the songs for that show were, and these are things we spent basically the whole year practicing over and over. I don't even know what the other 2 shows I did in high school were. Interesting. Thanks for sharing. 

I'm looking to study psychology now, possibly going as far as becoming a psychiatrist, if I can. So all of this obviously interests me beyond researching for my own purposes. 

Hopefully you can figure it out. Good luck :)
