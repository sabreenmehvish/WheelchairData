Meeting on Monday with the voc rehab guy to talk about getting my new wheelchair! Anything I should do to be prepared and make things go smoother? Since my insurance would almost 100% certainly refuse to cover a decent wheelchair for me (and it would cost me way more than I could ever come up with on my own), voc rehab is taking over getting it for me because I need it to finish my degree and work. I've met the rehab tech guy once before because he helped me get a rolling walker and some tools for my vision impairment about a year ago, so I know he's a really cool dude. Rather than me having to drive over an hour to his office, he's meeting me in my town since he'll be here anyway to go to our local office. 

I'm ridiculously excited to get this process started and get my chair (I've been using a heavy secondhand one that doesn't really fit me well), but I want to be as prepared as possible for our meeting on Monday. I don't know what to expect really, especially since we're not meeting at his office. I don't even have a prescription from my doctor because she was waiting on voc rehab to tell her what she should put down to make sure I get exactly what I need. I had hoped my voc rehab counselor had spoken with her and worked that out, but I haven't been able to get a hold of either one since I got the call on Thursday about the meeting. 

Honestly I'm just so excited and happy and I had to tell someone! Any advice would be lovely as well though!  To get my wheelchair I had to be evaluated by physical therapy and then my dr ordered it for me. You really should make sure that someone skilled in fitting clients to chairs helps you out to get the appropriate fit. I had to have a special seat for my needs and my insurance covered everything without question because it was fully documented.
