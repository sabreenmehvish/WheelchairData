How does your job deal with your disability? Hi all! 

I’m doing a podcast aimed at project managers, I want to talk about how to deal with disability in their teams (both people they directly manage and people in the project team). 

What are the most important topics/issues managers should deal with? 

I’m being open with what disabilities so everything from invisible disabilities such as anxiety, chronic fatigue or more visible things such as people who are deaf, blind or in a wheelchair. 

I’m really interested in this topic but uneducated - so the best places to go for resources would also be cool!  They moved me in to different position and cut my pay 50 cents. I loved the company but am now looking for something new. I was self employed for a long time, and I just started working for the state govt. 

So far my boss is totally cool with it. When I told her what accommodations I needed she just said don’t worry about it and asked if there was anything else that would make it easier for me. I offered to tell her what my deal was and before I could offer a doctors note she told me no explanation or note was required. 


One tome I skipped going to lunch with the team because I was feeling halfway off. She started to tease me until she asked why I missed it, the second I said I was having a low health day she immediately apologized. 

This is why I only looked at state govt. jobs when I decided to no longer work for myself 


Govt. work has its drawbacks too. I’m making about half what I did when I worked for myself (totally worth it though, lower stress, fewer hours, and better life balance is already helping with my health) 


 I work at a university setting, doing a lot of phone work for different studies.  Our office actually has a few individuals with disabilities/health issues.

I don't need much.  I have a standing desk that acts as a screen raiser so my monitors are raised up to eye level (bonus: I can sit or stand) and I generally just use the browser options to adjust text size.  Generally, any paperwork I get is readable and if it isn't, no one makes a fuss if they need to reprint something (hell, I occasionally provide feedback for our site design because we do have a large older population, but they don't exactly listen).

My co-worker wears a hearing aid and has her own office speficially because she needs to be on speakerphone (the rest of us are in cubicles).

Another co-worker has migraines and has a blue light filter screen.  

In general, we have pretty decent sick-time accrual and I've used a sick day when I've needed a mental health day because of anxiety attacks.   Get disability awareness training where possible. 
I worked at a call centre that had thought of everything! Ramps, accessible bathrooms, a nice office chair for when I didn’t want to sit in my wheelchair (I like a change of scenery sometimes)

Being able to have an open and honest discussion about disability! Ask the awkward questions! There’s no such thing as a stupid question.  [deleted] Project manager myself (web development and marketing) with adhd / asd / major depression / gad / ptsd. 

Our company openly does nothing for disabilities and most requests get denied, but as you're probably already well aware that doesn't mean the people stop existing or their problems go away.

The most important topic / issue to deal with is open acceptance that just because someone does a job differently that doesn't make it inherently wrong as long as the outcome is the same (or within acceptable parameters). Limiting a person's avenues to succeed is by far the fastest way to stop anyone with a disability, and likewise making sure there are enough options openly available without requiring requests is equally critical.

Small example is open work rooms. We have little cubbies that anyone in the office can work in. They can dim the lights, put on music without headphones, lay down and work, etc without putting in any kind of request. 

Most people, myself included, will not openly admit to having a disability because of the stigma and high probability of being fired in at-will states. It is very common.

I always try to 1 on 1 as many of my team as possible and write down all their pain points. Honestly disability or not just working with your team is smart. If someone is very poor at communication don't make them point person for emailing out important information. It doesn't matter if its because they're on the spectrum and suck at communicating or just someone that genuinely sucks at communicating. The outcome just won't be good. Sometimes it can't be avoided but putting someone on the spot to speak in front of a group with social anxiety is a great way to shoot down their confidence and guarantee they never perform at their best. It could be as simple as being forced to talk at a stand up when they aren't prepared. Try to remember this for daily stand ups / scrum master roles / activities and education. 

Now on the largest of teams this is nearly impossible and instead I rely on their immediate managers to do this, which means it won't get done right. I'll usually have to have some kind of follow up or SOP written to make sure it gets done correctly - I can hold them accountable then. The bigger the team, the harder it gets to make sure immediate managers are accommodating their employees.

Which brings us to the hardest thing to overcome - office culture. In the end, good office culture enables employees more than anything else. A positive and supportive environment will take "ok" employees and make them great, "great" employees become amazing, and "amazing" employees become rock stars. Unfortunately this isn't something you can just change. Often it starts at hiring the right people in the first place and having rules designed to reward good behaviors and dissuade bad ones. Making it clear that "just joking" is never an excuse to make fun of how someone is doing something, and that being supportive is always better.

*Edit:* **TL;DR:** Disability or not, all employees should already have their strengths focused on so they can succeed. A disability might just require a more specific or unique fix than normal. I asked for a laptop so that I can get up and find a quiet place to work if it gets too noisy in the office \(I am an Aspie\).

They allow me to call into meetings rather than sit in a room full of people as that will drive my anxiety and diminish my ability to follow along to any one voice.

They let me work from home on days that I am struggling to deal with the office activity.

Thankfully I am a developer, so I can pretty much work from anywhere and get the job done. Honestly, the only real advice I have to employers, managers and the like is to ask the people they're hiring.

If Suzie needs a screen reader, but Jake is colorblind and needs a magnifier, they obviously have different needs to each other.

Suzie might need Jaws, a screen reader, and a Braille display, while Jake may need zoomtext and the staff to think about color contrast in their software. Due to my condition (a left sided visual field cut), not much can be done except "okay, don't worry about it, that makes sense" I am in a wheelchair (smushed legs due to an auto accident) and I work (part-time - I am in college) mostly from my apartment doing editing, proofreading, and writing.

When I work in the office my primary concern is accessibility. Naturally, an entrance needs to be free of steps and the office furniture needs to accommodate wheelchairs, but from a wheelchair I cannot reach high shelves. Also, the bathrooms need to be accessible. They should allow the user to back the wheelchair to a position beside the toilet and transfer sideways. The stall needs to be large enough to accommodate the wheelchair (including turning around).

Fortunately, the office where I and a wheelchair-bound lawyer (fulltime) spend some time is very accommodating. He is a partner (part owner) of the firm. Hello, I am actually in a disability communication class and recommend you look into the Autism at Work program that SAP center has implemented in their company. Hope this helps!  Got disabled while working. Was fired. So I guess my answer is "not well". ***writes in notes - “don’t do that”*** In essence - it’s around trust? Hat your boss trusts you to get the job done and believes you when you need to do what you need to do?  That sounds like a good workplace. I'm a little jealous :D Fantastic! Sick-time is so good! Especially if you’re not too scared to do it - and if you were even slightly scared it would be unlikely that you would feel able to take the odd mental health day.  Aagghhhgh

My sympathies!  Thanks! Will do - what’s SAP centre?  Not OP, but that's my situation. I tried to quit cold turkey about 18 months after starting with my firm because I was in so much pain (pushing myself to work what the ABs were doing, 50+ hours/week). They were super supportive (actually refused my resignation and just told me to "do what I need to do").

I will admit, it was super stressful in the beginning. I constantly felt like I wasn't doing enough, or felt like taking a break was somehow slacking. As I got more confident in my skills, and in what I offer my employer, I've felt a lot better about my position. I bring a lot to the table, specifically because of my disability, and I've learned how to leverage that.  My boss trusts that I'm not lying to her.  The nature of my disease will make me less productive than I could be without it (I'm still a mint fuckin' choocher though), but she recognizes that nobody is perfect and I add something to the department with or without a disability. 


Or maybe she just doesn't want to get slammed with a lawsuit and will fire me in six months for some b/s pretext reason.  Time will tell. I like it.  It took a long time for me to get this job, and I still take the university's "disability inclusion" policy with a grain of salt, but it's leaps and bounds above other places I've worked.   SAP center is an arena for a hockey team and also for concerts. SAP is the company that owns the arena.
