I don't post about accidents involving wheelchairs, but this escalator death is a warning.  If there are signs warning that you shouldn't take a stroller with a kid on an escalator, why on earth would someone ride a wheelchair on one. That is a danger to anyone behind and below. Unbelievable. Never try to ride an escalator in a wheelchair, with a stroller, or even a walker. The elevators are there for a reason.
