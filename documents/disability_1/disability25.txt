Wheelchair survey - please help!  Hi everyone. I posted a link to a survey my group is doing for our Capstone project. This is purely for educational purposes only. Any of you who can go through these questions will be great. It should only take a couple minutes to complete. Appreciated. 

Ps. I also posted this link to the r/wheelchair subreddit a few hours ago. The survey originally had a couple issues that needed to be addressed, but they should be fine now.

 r/https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NXWWJ39  I can't answer question 2 because whoever created it has not considered the posibility that someone could be a wheelchair user for more than 20 years. I've been a user for more than 40 years. Done it. I selected that I'm a manual wheelchair user but still got asked about my electric wheelchair preferences, was that meant to happen? I'm 35 and have used a wheelchair most of  my life. Maybe you could have a category for "lifelong". did it :) Done. Good luck I just did it. If anyone's wondering, it's very short, you don't have to write out any answers and it only takes a minute or two to complete. Done! Done. Question 2 needs to be edited. I’m 29, and I’ve used a wheelchair my whole life. More than 20 years.  Did you get mod approval?
