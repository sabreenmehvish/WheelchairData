Wheelchair users, do you have any problems with storage? Hello, my name is Jack and I am currently creating a design for wheelchair users, which will create more easily accessible storage for wheelchairs. Do you have any suggestions on what i can add and what problems you have? Meaning using storage as a person in a chair, or actual storage on the wheelchair itself? I'm going to assume you mean storage on the chair, for the user. If that's the case, I'd appreciate something about the length and width of a carry-on suitcase, but about half as deep. Say, the depth of a pair of push cane handles.

I think you'd find some universality to the mounting if it were affixed to the rigidizer bar. My biggest issue in nearly every product like this that I've seen is getting it detached, swung onto my lap, accessed, then put back. My reason for the difficulty is my paralyzed hands. I'm a strong quad, but noodle-fingers are still limited in what I can securely grab, and hold to replace.

Maybe a double hook system, inset in a storage case recess (inset around the rigidizer bar so it can sit more flatly against a backrest), with a guiding method or device to help replace the storage device, once the user is finished using it.

That is my two cents. Hope I was clear enough. Thank you, you were very clear in your response. The push cane size is something that I hadn't thought of and will definitely go into the final design. I can't reveal all the details of the design yet but if you want i will make sure to send you some pictures of the final product. Great! Glad I could add something. Yes, I'd appreciate seeing some final images, and let us know if there's a Kickstarter, or when and where it's available.
