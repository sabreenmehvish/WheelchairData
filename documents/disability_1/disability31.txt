Wheelchair Accessible Experiences in London Hi all 👋 We've been working on creating a place to find all kind of workshops and experiences in London (pottery, painting, coffee tasting, etc), and now we are doing a big focus on wheelchair accessible workshops. 

If anyone is interested in getting crafty and trying some workshops and you live in London, have a look at the link below. Very keen to hear what you think! 🙂

Thank you!
