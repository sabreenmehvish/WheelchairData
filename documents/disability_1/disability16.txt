Two VR students looking for wheelchair users for questionnaire Hello /r/disability.

We're students in Denmark studying software development with a special focus on virtual/augmented reality.
We've begun on our semester projects and me and my partner would like to make a virtual experience about being in a wheelchair with focus on the struggles involved.

Therefore we kindly ask you to fill out this [questionnaire.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRIHLcz1mkEuPHZoMLavKhQiZ-l6PyxW8CM4uhpzks0xUXow/viewform?usp=sf_link)
It consists of questions about your background, your every day life, home accessibility issues and social situations. All fields are voluntary. It's going to be used for inspiration/source material for a virtual experience.

Hope you will be kind enough to help us with this and any feedback or other insight you would like to share with us is more than welcome.

Best regards,
two danish VR students.

edit: included information about the survey, the data being collected, and how the data will used. Please include trying to wheel through a parking lot or sidewalk that has snow and ice in your experience. My kids' school plowed their lot, but getting from the car to the door was absolutely exhausting. Also trying to wash dishes in a wheelchair is really hard. My sink is too high and the washing machine is too. Grocery shopping means having to ask for help for many things that are too high up or too heavy. I assume your project is to give people an idea of what it's like, I hope it helps people to have more empathy. I wish you success and good luck. Some questions need a n/a choice. Also the questions about the rooms presuming they have or haven’t been renovated are confusing. If they’d all been renovated they’d all be fine. Done! Just to let you know, you spelled “whole” as “howl” on the question asking how long you’ve been in a wheelchair. Let me get this straight. 

You want to make a disability simulation game in order to build sympathy or something?  Just done it! Hope it helps! Done. Good to see people taking an interest Did you read the sidebar? Thanks a lot for the input!

And thanks for the encouragement. =)

edit: spelling I second this...what would be my issue with a room that has been modified to work for me? By definition that room would get a 1 response in the questionnaire. And what does inaccessible in the previous question even mean? That’s sure a huge range. If the living room is inaccessible as in up a flight of stairs, then I guess my response is 5. If it’s inaccessible as in just your average living room, well...that’s a pretty straightforward room my answer is 1. This line of questioning is too vague and unclear to yield useful information.

(In case there’s a language barrier, “n/a” means not applicable)  Thanks.
And we noticed that too just now. =P
 Well first and foremost it's a semester project.
We went with wheelchair because we wanted to see how the locomotion would work in VR.
It's not really gonna be shown to anyone but the teachers and students at this point. Thanks very much. =) Yes. We got permission from the mods but accidentally forgot the last steps. Correcting now.
Thanks They have permission.  Hey, Oelgaard, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. We agree the question could have been put better. But hopefully people will get the intention of the questions.

But the answers we're receiving is giving us "good enough" information to go forward.

We'll remember this for another time.
Thanks /u/Frugalista1 and /u/weboverload . I suggest that you and your team members spend a little time in a wheelchair to get the feel - the same day, you'll have some laughs, and wheelies are fun. The motion in a wheelchair is different than you'd expect when you jerk.  Locomotion with wheelchairs in VR is an interesting topic, and one that might be very important if society adopts more VR interfaces!

That said, for the life of me I can’t see how your questionnaire questions are relevant to the topic. Care to explain some of your thought process? Perhaps we could help you develop a better questionnaire. > Well first and foremost it's a semester project.

I knew that. That doesn't make my question a moot one. 

Semester projects can be disability simulation games. They can be businesses, or even the smallest of things. They often have more than one use.

That's all I really wanted to know. I'm glad to answer your questionnaire, I just needed a little more info. Hopefully you can understand with all of the "inspiration porn" and "pity projects" out there that only ask us and center on the negative side of our disability that some of us would be a bit apprehensive asking such questions that would normally be regarded as private.

I wish you luck on your project and am glad to support it! :)    
 No worries! Nothing the disability community hopes for more than “good enough”.  What we wanted answers to from the questionnaire were 4 things.

The locations where the main scenes are gonna take place and the order of those scenes.

The things that's gonna help the player.
And things that create obstacles the player is going encounter and hopefully overcome.

And then some tidbits to influence the design.

Hope that sort of answers the question.
