Genius alert  As someone who can walk but has chronic pain condition worsened by the impact of walking, I could totally actually use that... if my city were truly wheelchair accessible. This has to be satire  lol itâ€™s called a bicycle.

Or a power chair. This isn't your average everyday stupid... This is advanced stupid. I get that this is supposed to be satire bc "lol, duh, people in wheelchairs can't use their legs!" but that's frustrating to me because ~80% of people who use wheelchairs have some ability to stand or walk. -___-

That said, someone mentioned recumbent bicycles up above-- I got one to help me exercise and get out of the house (can't be upright for too long without fainting) and it's great for outdoor travel. Not great for going places and interacting with buildings. They are too bulky for indoors as well as being both pricey and reasonably difficult to lock. 

A smaller pedaled chair would actually be pretty useful for a lot of folks. But due to public views on disability re wheelchairs it would be socially difficult.  finally someone addressing the needs of the underserved only lost use of my butt population  Maybe we could make use of recumbent bikes lol. Less strain on the knees *and* the back! Actually...I might go do some research... Same! All my joints are trash but sometimes my power chair is too big for alot of places, but pushing a manual one is all good for short distance and flat smooth ground. This would be so helpful  something like a pedicab but just the comfy seat no bike seat with wheels on the side and at feet would be pretty nice His stupidity knows no bounds, this is funny but I should feel shocked
