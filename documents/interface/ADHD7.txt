Apps used in coping with ADHD The apps I use that help me cope day-to-day with my ADHD:


**Google Keep** (free)
I love this app. This is very, very powerful because typing a bunch of notes on my phone isn’t always my preferred way of remembering things. Keep is basically a note taking application developed by Google that features color coded notes, labeling said notes, creating lists, inserting images, reminders, voice recording notes to yourself, the list goes on. Sounds pretty complicated! But it’s not, once you play around with it it’s one of the easiest tools ever. There are many decent youtube videos explaining what it is and does, but here is a very short one (48 seconds) that caters to our ADHD brains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbvkHEDvw-o

How do I use it? Primarily, like this: http://imgur.com/iH7S8dE
That's my to-do list(s) color-coded into priority. Very helpful when trying to prioritize. 


Those cards are always at the top and are always easily accessible. I can add and edit on-the-go on my phone or computer. Yes, any computer, it doesn’t have to be on my personal laptop. Cool, right? Even cooler is that every little thing I want to remember, I can add it to a different notecard in Keep and can always search for it as long as I remember a keyword from it.

Daily inspirational quotes that motivate me? Check. Grocery list? Check. Early start for Christmas present ideas? Check. 
It’s all with me all of the time, everywhere I go. I love Google Keep. 

**Google Calendar** (free)
Any calendar app will do, but I particularly like Google Calendar because it syncs so seamlessly with https://www.google.com/calendar. This is very powerful. Trying to get organized with the weeks or months ahead is much easier on a desktop with a keyboard than on a phone on-the-go. Plan and type in your engagements in the simple-to-use interface and it magically syncs with the app on your phone, iPad, etc. You can edit or add to this with any computer or device, anywhere at any time with your Google login credentials.

**Pocket**
This application is very unique to me because when I discovered it, it solved a problem of mine I never even realized I had. Have you ever found an article online somewhere that you’re interested in reading but don’t have the time at that moment in time? Most people would just email it to themselves so they would remember to read it later.
After sending myself dozens of these emails daily, I soon started to realize that this is actually a terrible system from an organizational standpoint. I routinely lost track of what was what and what was where. But I kept doing because I wanted to read ALL OF THE THINGS!
This is where Pocket comes in. See an article on the internet you like and want to read *later*? Maybe it’s a long one, or maybe you know once you start reading it you’ll get off task and use it as another way to procrastinate. Save it to Pocket! It saves all of the websites/articles for you and makes it easy to view them later (while removing ads!)

**Scanbot**
I just recently discovered this app, and one day it may very well become my most important tool in combating ADHD. You know that fine line between being a hoarder and being a responsible adult who keeps track of important documents? Nobody told me about that line, so my whole life I’ve hoarded useless pieces of paper while losing important documents all of the time. I’ve read suggestions to scan everything, but come on! Who’s really going to do that? Scanbot is amazing, because you just snap a picture of the document with the app and it auto-uploads it as a pdf in Google Drive (or whatever cloud service you prefer) to be found later. The magic this is app, however is its use of OCR. What that means for you: every document you scan will become searchable. Search for “Honda” and every document you uploaded from the dealership (oil changes, repairs, etc.) or the DMV will be found if it had the word “Honda” somewhere in there. Cool, right?
 

**Headspace**
There is a lot of emerging research on mindfulness and meditation, particularly concerning its effects on individuals with ADHD. I’ve tried to meditate before. It was impossibly hard. I didn’t know what to do, how do you just *not think*?
Headspace is a guided meditation app that is supposed to essentially guide you throughout the process. I’ve found it helpful, and it appears to calm me down a bit after using it for ten minutes.
Honestly haven’t used this much, but I think it’s important enough to include.


Tangibly related to keeping me organized with ADHD:

**Feedly** (free)

I’m interested in many different topics, and as a result like to regularly visit hundreds of websites to stay current on them. This app helps me keep the topics organized. Works really well with Pocket.

**Google Photos** (free)
Keeps all of my pictures backed up for free. I have it set up so that every picture I take with my phone gets immediately  backed up onto Google’s cloud. Unlimited backups, for free!

**Pocket Casts** ($4)
I’ve always known about podcasts but just recently discovered how cool they are. I can learn fun facts about very random subjects while driving? Improve my vocabulary while laughing? Listen to interesting stories about real people? Pocket Casts does a great job of helping me discover new podcasts while keeping the ones I’m interested in well organized.

**Google Maps** (free)
I never know where I’m going as I’m very geologically challenged. Not sure if related to ADHD or not. 

**Paprika** ($5)
I recently got interested in cooking. There are so, so many recipes out there that I had no way or keeping them organized until I discovered this app. It’s fantastic and worth every dime.



That’s it for now, will add to this list later if I think of anything new that may be meaningful.

Oh, one more thing. I’ve proven myself not to be trusted so I’ve only got one real rule: no games on the phone. Games are for the iPad. At home. Not for when I get bored at the red light.

If you guys have anything to add, please do. I look forwarding to seeing any suggestions you may have and I'm sure the rest of the community here does as well. While I specifically use an Android device, everything I have listed is available for both Android and iOS.


TL;DR: apps that help cope with ADHD +1 on the Keep! Combined with my smartwatch I can keep track of everything and make sure I'll remember important tasks! And maps is a lifesaver, even when I know which way to go (not often,) using driving mode to check traffic, accidents, construction, etc. (Check settings inside maps to add the shortcut to your home screen!) I wonder, are there any of yall who have been able to give up the smartphone completely? I find myself zoning out into mine for hours at a time. When I wake up, before I sleep, all I do is mindlessly browse the internet (reddit especially). Have any of yall tried using a non-smart phone just for texting and calling?
 [deleted] Pocket sounds fantastic. I can't tell you how many articles I've been unable to find again after bookmarking them, because I just never look at my bookmarks! As for mindfulness-related things, [Pause](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/beautiful-new-app-like-stress-relieving-lava-lamp/) is super nice.  > no games on the phone

You might as well shoot me now. I need something to get me through boring as shit telecons from 8-10 daily... Thanks for this, the only thing I've been doing is playing a game to help calm my mind enough to actually fall asleep.

**∞ Infinity Loop** is the name, a mindless little puzzle game that's afaik endless and is also pleasing to my OCD. Evernote ... okay, the greatest advances of humankind, in order of importance:
1 - Fire
2 - The wheel
3 - Breaking Bad
4 - Evernote

Nothing has eliminated more clutter in my life, than Evernote. Instruction manuals and obscure parts and batteries for appliances and kids' toys: a few pictures on my phone into Evernote, and toss it. Important receipts and documents: click and toss. Awesome things the kids say: Evernote. Medical records: Evernote. Favorite beers: Evernote. Shit my wife hates that I must never buy for her *again*: Evernote. Kids' school and art projects and notes from teachers. Awesome ideas that I might forget in the next 15 minutes: Evernote. Music I need to learn: record into Evernote. Handwritten notes: take a pic, upload, and Evernote does a full-text OCR and can read my fucking handwriting, so I can find that note later.

And did I mention *searchable*? With the pro version, it OCR's PDF's and other text. You don't even need to come up with a fancy tagging system (although it helps). Just type a freaking word in the search field.

I fucking cannot live without Evernote.

But it sounds like Google Keep might be *almost* the same.

EDIT: No, I don't work for Evernote. Not a mention of OneNote? I find the structure to be way easier for my adhd brain than any other app.. Or rather, the lack of structure. 

There's an infinite canvas and you can click at any empty area and start typing. 

While writing documents I start writing each paragraph in it's own little 'area' and I can put little notes near each paragraph. 

It's 'organized chaos' like how my desk is. 

Messy, but I know exactly where everything is - because I manually kept it there instead of having some kind of structure dictated by the app.  This is a great list.  Thanks for sharing! I think I use Evernote the way you use Google Keep.  I have left reddit for [a reddit alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/wiki/index) due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  

   The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.  

   The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.  

   As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.  

   If you would like to do the same, install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome, [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit) for Safari, [Violent Monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) for Opera, or [AdGuard](http://adguard.com/) for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add [this GreaseMonkey script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/16006-reddit-overwrite-extended-with-list-of-alternatives).   

 Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on the comments tab, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.

Is a good one. It limits the time you can spend on specific sites Some might not think it all that helpful, but I use myfitnesspal as a way to keep tabs on what I'm eating.  It gives me accountability of what food I'm taking in so I don't over-eat.  I have no impulse control over my snacking otherwise. The problem with note keeping is that I often get sidetracked before I can make a note.  I use Business Calendar and Todoist. Business Calendar is a bit poorly designed, but it's functional. Todoist spams the shit out of me with stupid fucking emails and lacks customisability and sometimes is too cluttered... But it's good. I use most of these, except instead of Scanbot, I use [OfficeLens](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&hl=en) which is the MS version of OCR. I like that it auto corrects for the paper layout i.e., deskews it and it also has a whiteboard mode, which is great cause I use that at work all the time to keep notes I'd otherwise forget. I use Keep instead of Google's reminder feature because it's faster. 

I use "OK Timer" to set 10min timers to remind me to check if I'm on task. 

I also recommend "Do Now", although I stopped using it. Wow, these are amazing!! I wish I knew about these when I started college, but it's never too late. For keeping track of things that need to be done regularly (daily, weekly, x times/week, etc), I haven't found anything better than Productive. 

If you search around, the developer linked a code to get the pro upgrade for free in this sub. Definitely worth looking into.  For Android users I recommend MemoWidget. It simply lets you add memos as widgets on the menu screen. You can customize the colours of the background and text so that it contrasts and stands out from your screen background.

 It allows me to check on notes without having to open any apps (except when writing down the note itself) just by unlocking my phone and looking at the menu. Useful when I'm on-the-move and I need to check the address of where I'm heading to or the room number of my class.  Thank you. I'll have a look at Pocket and Scanbot and Headspace. really like that you showed how you set up, your google keep app, modeled my self on yours!  I would recommend today calander over Google calendar. They both aync with your Google account. Also Genius  Scan is the best scanner app in my opinion. FBreader is a good app for reading all those ebooks I always want to read. I wrote a post on Habitica (Free. iOS, Android and desktop) on some other thread. Will repost. 

> Hey! I'm 23 years old and have ADD-inattentive as well. A couple of days ago I started using Habitica and holy crap I'm on fire. Basically, it's a productivity app disguised as an RPG. The things you can check off are split into several categories:

> - **Habits** Stuff like: Don't snooze the alarm clock, clean up, work out, stay off internet (these are my personal ones). You can assign a "plus" or "minus" value here. For instance, if I stay off the internet, I click the plus sign and I get exp and gold. If I click the minus sign I lose HP. Not clicking at all won't help or harm you.

> - **Dailies** These are things you need to do everyday, like brush your teeth, take your ADHD pills. You can sort tasks into morning, afternoon or evening.  Missing these *will* hurt your HP.

> - **to-dos** This is exactly what you think. Doing them will give you goodies like gold and exp. If you set a due date and not do them, it will hurt you.

> With gold you can buy things like potions and weapons and clothes to adorn your avatar; with exp you can level up and then choose your character class. If you join a party you can go on quests and battle bosses. You battle them just by doing great at your own goals. But if you're questing and you don't do well, everyone in your party will take damage, so you can get a couple of friends to keep you accountable. The community also has a ADHDer guild. I'm in it and loving it so far, it's full of people like us talking about ADHD. In fact their wiki has a page for ADHD: http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Adapting_Habitica_for_ADHD

> It's free. Well, you can pay them to support development, but all the rewards you can pay for (gems) you can also get for free- by achieving more of your goals and winning challenges (like, the "go to sleep on time" challenge), so I wouldn't recommend paying anything. I'm much more motivated than I've ever been. I recently hit level 6 and hatched 3 pets. It really did trick me into thinking I'm playing a video game and battling monsters (my ADHD!)

> PS: I'm absolutely still taking medication. This is not a substitute for medication.
https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4aqitc/A/d135q4l/.json?context=3d135q4l Habitica for todos, daily todos and reminders. Treating my life as a game is very gratifying.

I have used Evernote for years, and was using until recently OneNote for Business related stuff. (I use Evernote for personal stuff). But lately I've been trying out Apple's Notes. It has VASTLY improved as of late and I like the integration on my iPhone and mac with Reminders.

And of course, Calendar. I find that if I really need to do something, instead of just creating a todo, I'll also immediately block out time on my calendar that will remind me not only that I need to do something but when exactly in time it needs to happen. Surprised [Workflowy](https://www.workflowy.com) hasnt come up.

It's a note-taking app at heart with a lot of cool features, you can link things using #'s and mark things as more important or less important. 

But the structure is the coolest thing to me, but it's got organization that just makes sense. You can have a note, then collapsed under that note you can have 5 tasks for it, then under each task you can have more tasks, etc etc.  HUGE shoutout to **Sloth** (free, extra features for a few dollars). It's a task setup app... You make a task, name it, and assign a time. Then it goes in the queue. When it's done, a timer goes off once, and you can set the task done from the lock screen or the app, and the next task starts automatically (you can set the next task start to manual only if you want).

It works for me because it's so simple. I don't find scores motivating - I need as little interface as possible between me and the functionality I want. No screens to go through, nothing to load, no graphics to distract me - just open it up, type in the list I want, and get started. It took a couple tries to get used to the swipe commands, but now that I've got the hang of them they make operating it really fast. It's minimalist perfection and I love it. 

A few extra dollars buys you a version you can load lists of tasks into. I'll probably get that soon. 

I use it to program in study/break blocks of varying times and give them titles that remind me (eg, list of tasks might be: study epidemiology, break, study, break, study stat inference, break, study) Forgot **Notefuly** (iOS, iPhone only. Free for limited features, $0.99 otherwise)

A corkboard program that is slick and nice looking. You can write sticky notes (in all sorts of styles) and convert the entire board into a wallpaper and put it on your lock screen, so every time you use your phone you will see your reminders/task list. There are other less nice looking options to achieve the same thing like taking screenshots of your reminder list, but I like my lock screen nice :) I haven't used it much since I did Habitica, but I do know Habitica/other apps is not for everyone so here's another option.

I would also like to remind everyone on iOS (in case you haven't already), many productivity apps come with Notification Center widgets. I suggest you pimp your notification center and take *full advantage* of your "Today" tab. Scroll to the bottom and click "Edit"; there you get to choose your widget and order them. When you pull it down, at one glance you can see (for instance, this is mine) your calendar, weather, stargazing conditions, to-dos, reminders, world clock, etc. ALL in one screen. Incredibly powerful bird's eye view of your day. earlier this year i wrote a pretty long post on this exact thing:
https://m.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4apkf3/apps_used_in_coping_with_adhd/?utm_source=mweb_redirect&compact=true
tons of good suggestions on there from the comments. 
in terms of adhd-related organization, the most "useful" apps have probably been Google Keep and Scanbot love the smartwatch integration. i'm terrified of getting one myself because i'm scared of another distraction I love keep. I have the widgets on my screens so I can easily flip to my list all the time.  
I run two lists, one for my school work, one for my actual stuff. [This is the screenshot](https://imgur.com/wQjRGym)  There's a nuclear option I still haven't implemented, yet I honestly can't think of any good reason why I shouldn't. And that's leaving my damn phone downstairs when I go to bed. Like you, I'm always in danger of spending an hour on the thing before I sleep, and procrastinating getting up in the morning using it. Aside from the vague chance of night time family emergencies (for which they could just ring my boyfriend's phone I guess) I can think of no downsides. I mean I even have an alarm clock. But I doubt I'll ever do it. I got a cheap prepaid phone once while visiting family overseas because my smartphone did not work there. It was a flip phone I bought just for communicating with family members and work. I found being unable to check things on my phone to be irritating at times and I found myself becoming bored while waiting for things since that's when I usually read articles on my phone. It did not do much to help my concentration, but that's just me. My iPhone helps me stay organized. Delete the reddit app. I went about two weeks that way and it was amazing. I was waking up and reading novels. It reduced my computer reddit usage too, for some reason. 

Eventually got back, but I deleted a lot of time wasting subs and use it mainly for news and good discussion now.  Never. My smartphone has saved my life. I show up for things on time now, respond back to people on a timely basis and it's a place for me to dump whatever information I need to remember (because else it's going to be gone for good unless I get it down quick). 

It's a double-edged sword; Reddit, Facebook, Instagram are all very distracting. But I think a smartphones benefits to people with ADHD outweigh the negatives by far. If I go into Accessibility and turn the display to grayscale,  my iPhone is a whole lot less compelling...it just works to do that. [Relevant recent thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/49uha1/do_you_have_a_smartphone_addiction_you_think_is/)  Pretty ironic, really, about that Forest app. i upvoted your comment just so i could un-upvote and upvote it again.
thank you for telling me about Forest. Game-changer. all those times i told myself "I'm just gonna play on the phone for 15 minutes, and that's it for real this time" LOLNO.
seriously thank you. i can't wait to try it  huge fan of pocket, check it out. it'll change your internet-reading life pause looks great, was really glad to see that they also have an android version out as well. thanks for sharing. will definitely be checking that out lol, that's pretty funny. for moments like that i read headlines either through Reddit's front page or Feedly feeds to get caught up on what's going on in the world. I've discovered on several different occasions that (mobile) games are not conducive to my living the life i want to live  Infinity Loop is awesome. Totally with you on this one. It's like a "shut down" button for my brain when I can't sleep! might check it out. will have to evaluate whether it breaks the no games rule. thanks for sharing  love that Evernote works really well for you. a lot of people i like and respect use it. from what i gather keep and Evernote appear to do mostly the same thing. the OCR integration sounds pretty amazing (I'm not sure if Keep has that). to integrate keeping track of easily scanned documents and OCR, i discovered (and actively use) Scanbot. it's pretty neat. 

love that Evernote is an option for people though. i think it's very helpful for people trying to get--and stay--organized I really like OneNote but it never works for me, I've never even had a full week without it breaking again. I wish it were more reliable, I think I'll try Evernote - if you've used it, can you compare them and what helps you more with each? i used OneNote EXTENSIVELY while i was in undergrad. it was THE system i used to try and keep my shit together juggling note-taking in and out of classes. this was back in '11. the beauty of it is that it's all still backed up on microsoft's cloud service now, i can always go back and read up on whatever i remember having recently forgotten. 

to those who don't know what OneNote is, think of it as a multi-subject notebook. except you can have as many subjects as you want. and write whatever you want in it, however you want. and OCR everything to find it with a super quick search. pictures, documents, recipes, anything and everything.

i don't use OneNote anymore these days despite it being an awesome utility (i was in fact ecstatic when i discovered microsoft was making it available on iOS and android devices). google Keep became a thing long before OneNote became available to me on-the-go. Within the last year or so I tried re-incorporating new notebooks into my life with OneNote but haven't been successful, out of school I just haven't found how it fits when other tools/apps already fulfill all of my needs.

recipe management? Paprika, check. syncs between devices. 
note-taking on the go? Keep, check. also syncs.
project management and collaboration? you guessed it. google stepped up to meet my needs and goals on any device at anytime before microsoft could get it going.

a shame, really.

anyway thanks for sharing onenote. it really is a brilliant platform  i don't doubt it, i heard they are both very similar. because of that i've decided since i'm already so heavily invested in the google ecosystem, might as well stay right? glad to hear evernote is just as useful  Wunderlist sends waaaaaaaaay too many emails. will definitely look into, could be a new way to get myself out of the house and into the gym or reading. very cool, thanks for sharing  sounds very useful, would love to check it out. got a link? search wasn't particularly productive.  agreed, love that you included that because I think that diet is directly related to our ADHD and overall happiness. love the strategy. thanks for sharing it with the adhd world, i hope more people see it I keep the Keep widget on my main home screen and it's got a voice note icon. If your brain can stay focused for about 3 seconds, it might do the trick. heard great things about todoist, girlfriend uses in her productivity system (she's about to have a phD in.... clinical psychology studying adh of all things). 

i used to use business calendar in college, i loved the week view. it was a beautiful way of viewing the next x amount of days while orienting me in time throughout the week. Once the Google calendar app natively included it though, i stopped using it. i know it's kinda snooby to say but it's UI is inexcusable for 2016.  cool! i heard about officelens a while back when it first debuted and told myself i should check it out. i will now actually be doing that, thanks for the re-heads up it's NEVER too late.

someone mentioned using Microsoft's OneNote to help keep their life organized. It's what I used a LOT while I was in college to keep track of everything, it was (and still is) pretty great. it just didn't evolve fast enough for me on the mobile platform after i graduated and then i met Google Keep. 
good luck! and thanks, i'm glad you found the list useful I can't seem to find this, is it on android?  love the concept, but can't find it on either iOS or Android. I tried searching within this subreddit, but anything on r/adhd with the search term "productive" hasn't been very....well, productive (chuckle).

got a link? or a developer's name? i would love to check it out love this. i do something similar, except like a kid i write stuff down on my forearm so i don't forget it. I'm 26 years old. it's so far been effective (lol) you're very welcome. also check out Pause http://stopbreathethink.org and Infinity Loop http://loopgame.co for mindfulness. they were introduced to me by the comments.  I'm glad you found it useful! keep at it. don't stop using it. start checking that list 4-5 times a day, it'll become a habit and after sticking with it, one of your most powerful adhd strategies  thanks for sharing. i tried genius scan for quite a while before discovering Scanbot. it made me realize scanning stuff doesn't mean i have to use a PIA computer and flatbed scanner. what separates the two is that with Scanbot, document detection (finding the document on a surface, framing it, and lining up the crop lines with the paper’s edges), multi-page support, and image quality are amazingly well done. and you cannot ignore the usefulness of OCR support (that's actually good!). apparently, Microsoft's OfficeLens does something similar. 
that annoying thing where i have to drag the corners of the document with that annoying little magnifying glass to accurately capture the page? those days are over. 


i remember trying today calendar. it wasn't for me. beautiful UI though. 

thanks for sharing  LOVE THIS will definitely check it out. thank you very much for re-posting that bit with your calendar, i do the same thing. gamifying life sounds like it's very effective and will try to implement that soon workflowy sounds very neat. can it sync across devices and input information on pc? how's the UI and ease of use?  sounds very neat and worth checking out. thanks for sharing! 
do you also use an appointment book app or anything specific as a calendar?  Go with a Pebble. It doesn't have as many potentially distracting apps on it, you can still get phone notifications on it, ***and*** you can go for days without having to charge it. 

I was on the fence about smart watches for a long time, but I gave in and got an OG Pebble. I ended up loving it so much that I upgraded to the Pebble Time after two months. I highly recommend it. I've found you can disable may things that are distracting, mainly individually disabling apps, like Facebook and reddit, from popping up on the watch. They can wait for later, but txts from my family , work emails, or my reminder, I want to see immediately, they stay on!

This varies by watch. I know the galaxy gears do it, and I'm pretty sure Android wear devices do as well. If you're on iOS you can go to Settings, scroll down to the apps, and disable notifications on any apps that distract you. great idea, i love that. wish keep existed when i graduated back in '11. talk about game changer. I'm seriously considering it, and I know its extreme but I'm at a pretty transitional moment in my life (just broke up with girlfriend, finishing up college, became a vegan, etc) where I feel like I should take advantage of the wave of changes that are affecting me and add this to it, before I enter a more solid stage and I'm not able. I dunno, I feel like I shouldn't have an addiction in my pocket.  Holy crap you're that works really well. I'm deep in the flip phone game but keep the iphone for wifi. I'll need that if I ever switch back. I agree! Sorry about that. I didn't even read that part (go figure ey?) It's more of a tool in my situation as I definitely do not play it because it's oodles of fun. I used to use Evernote a while ago. 

Evernote is like a typewriter. You type stuff, go to the next line, type more stuff. 

It's great if you're comfortable with 'linear' writing - text can go up and down, not in any other direction. 

Onenote is like a notebook you'd use in class. 

You can write points from the lecture, you can put in your own notes on the side, scribble stuff in the margins, etc. 

It is kinda buggy but most of the time I can close and reopen it, and it's the app that works best for me. 

Try Evernote, it might work for you. Try everything. There's many systems and you'll know it when you find the perfect one.  It's a chrome extension so if you search the app store it should pop up.
Il post a link when I get to my computer though.  same here, third swipe on my homescreen!  Naw, yeah, totes, I agree. It's just too bad I'm scared of using Google's apps. That company just weirds me out. And yes, I know Android is Google.

I like the reminder feature in Business Calendar. That's the one thing it has that Todoist severely lacks (unless you pay for it). On the other hand, Todoist allows you to plan for things that you will need to do, whereas Business Calendar is only good scheduling. What I mean is Todoist allows for (basic) prioritising in planning to have something finished, rather than to be simply doing something at some time. The problem with that functionality in Todoist is how it always defaults to a daily view, where you can only see the stuff that's *due* that day, rather than what needs to be worked on that day in order to have something done at a later date. So if I need to work on a large project, I have to create small tasks for me to finish in a day, or else I'll forget to do anything (unless I make a habit out of switching to a different view, but those other views also don't work very well). So actually I guess it isn't particularly helpful in planning to do stuff, unless I'm able to conceive of miniturised tasks which coalesce to form a larger one.

I guess I just wish the prioritising system was more advanced. There are four priority colours, and that's it. I'd rather have a thing due at some time, and then be able to say, "I need to work on this thing due at this time during these days." That's what I'd want. And actually, you can kiiiind of do that by making the thing do on several days. So there's that. I'm confused now. To my knowledge, it's iOS only, but I don't know if there may be plans to make an android version.  It looks like someone other than the dev is the one that linked it here. The original post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/39ip3s/method_ive_built_an_ios_app_that_helps_you_build/

So far as I know, it's iOS only.  do you have to color code something every time or is there a way to set it to do it by adding it to a colors sub category?  Can you use change the cropping lines if the auto-crop messes up? I just downloaded the iphone app... so yea it syncs across devices. 

The UI is what I meant by structure, its super simple and intuitive. I don't use most of the bells and whistles. [Here's their intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOPYrxvojVo&feature=youtu.be) that explains the UI.  Nah, none of the ones I've looked at have a fast/clean enough interface for me. Plus I really like having materials physically in front of me, where I can spread them out and look at them all at once instead of navigating different screens. I keep a physical day planner and put Post It notes on the wall above my desk to track assignments and appointments in the next week. 

I'm usually good at keeping up with appointments as long as I write down when they're coming up. 

If I ever feel like I want an app to supplement that stuff I'll definitely check this thread for recommendations, but "if it ain't broke don't fix it". I don't know if it is that extreme really. Just to play the old fart card, I got my first phone when I was 20, and I was a couple of years ahead of my friends. Before that you went to bed and you went to sleep. You might read a book. But unless it was very exciting, it would help you to sleep rather than hinder you. Reading a book is also a finite task, you can see how long you've been doing it for. If you've ADHD chances are you can't concentrate on it for that long anyway, so you turn the light out. A phone on the other hand has infinite content that you can consume in small chunks, so is perfect for our scatty brains to look at for hours. You're also literally shining a bright light in your eyes. I think you should give it a go for a couple of nights, if for no other reason than you can report back here and make me feel guilty for not having done it.

EDIT:- thinking about it, I might have got my first phone at age 20 but you couldn't browse the internet on it. I was probably about 25 when that happened. no worries. i looked into it and installed it, it looks very neat. initially i was a little concerned because of the blue light phones emit that tend to make it harder to sleep (ha! i'll pretend that i don't read reddit on my phone most nights trying to go to sleep). 

to deal with that one little concern, on android there's an app called CF.lumen; iOS has f.lux. also available on OS X and PC. works wonderfully. don't know if you know about it but i think combine the elimination of that blue glow and that pleasant sleepy app, you might have a winner.

thanks again for sharing infinity loop with the world Thanks for your thoughts! I will try Evernote since I really want the reliability, and as much as I love Onenote's flexibility, I haven't been using it as much as I thought I would. > . Try everything. There's many systems and you'll know it when you find the perfect one.

love that response  gotcha! makes sense. for some reason i was looking for something like that on iOS and Android app stores. 

yeah you're right, something like that would be super helpful i used to feel the same way, privacy is a huge priority/concern for me. 

one day i had an epiphany. no matter what i do there are companies out there that will know me better than my parents or best friends do, regardless of what i do or use. i might as well take advantage of some convenient products/services if it helps me in life. 

unlike many, many of my peers, what i can control is my internet presence and what i put on facebook.  i know what you mean with that last paragraph. I've discovered that to-do lists are at best not enough, at worst ineffective. i needed a system, a way to use them effectively. 


based on the good reviews, i bought a book on Amazon kindle for like $1.99 called Your Life Can Be Better by Doug Puryear. it's a book by a psychiatrist that has adhd himself talking about his strategies dealing with it his whole life. he's got a great strategy with to-do lists dealing with exactly the dilemma you described. check it out. 

also, link to his blog to an article kind of talking about it briefly: https://addadultstrategies.wordpress.com/2014/04/15/to-do-lists-add-tip-o-the-day-489/ :( good to know. at least we know something like it is out there for iOS users! i'm not exactly sure what you mean by adding it to a colors sub-category. my thought is no, not really.

think of it like this. each note you make is a sticky note, on a big wall. each sticky note defaults to being the same color--i think it's white, or light grey. you can change the color of each sticky note to represent something different, e.g. blue- projects, green- school, yellow- life/todo, orange- stuff around the house, etc. 

as you can imagine, this can become quite the cluster with all these sticky notes everywhere. the color coordination helps. *searching* through the sticky notes is infinitely useful, as i don't have to look through them all to find what i'm looking for. and on each sticky note you don't have to have just text--you can have pictures, DRAW pictures, voice memos, whatever. you can even make categories. 


it's what i've found works best for me at this point in life. because keeping the sticky notes organized isn't the challenge--i can find what i'm looking for very easily simply by searching a term. the challenge is remembering to write a sticky note. and Keep makes that easy.

hope this was helpful the app strongly recommends you scan documents etc. on contrasting backgrounds, e.g. white paper on wooden background, dark carpet, etc. when doing that, it's been my experience that auto-crop has yet to mess up. their algorithm actually impressed me.

so to answer your question, i don't really know. i've never had to find out.  awesome, will definitely be looking at that later. thanks for sharing  completely agree. i feel as though if what you're doing works, don't mess with it. it's taken me a long time to finally get to where what I'm doing "works" so i thought i would share it with the world in case other ADHDers didn't have a working system themselves  Yeah I think I'll pick one up during spring break. I used to be an avid reader, it was all I would do, I'd read two a week. Now I feel like I don't read at all, not even one book per month, and I think the knowledge I'd get from reading would far outweigh any non-ending novel information I get on reddit. I'll take you up on it and give it a go.  Man there is literally an app for everything these days. Yeah, that's definitely one way to go about things.

... But no matter what, when shit hits the fan, your shit'll be in there too. Lol, shit. Hmhmhm, true, thanks. I will look into this book. ya i made the same categories as you, i was wondering is there was a way that when it goes to a category it takes on the same color as the category.  You may spur me on too, I'm good at telling other people what to do and awful at doing it. I used to be able to concentrate and enjoy a book more when I was a teenager I think. It must be because it was literally the only sensory input in the room. Good luck! i see. i have no idea but i imagine that could be pretty useful. if you find out a way, share with the class! if not, let's send google some feedback  So I did it! And I couldn't be happier, it's like I have 27 hours in the day instead of 24. I still keep the iphone and I can use any of its apps if I'm on wifi, but it really helps not having me in my pocket all the time. The new phone does have internet if I really need it, but it's crappy enough it doesn't distract me. The only thing I still need to figure out is how to easily transfer photos off the phone, I've just been sending them to myself in emails, which is a little cumbersome. But otherwise I have more free time, and I'm much more present in every situation, be it class or dinner.
