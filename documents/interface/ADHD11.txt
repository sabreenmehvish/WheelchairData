Best Calendar app to organize my life? Hello! I'm a student with medicated ADHD (Strattera). I'm a senior in highschool and while I like to think I do pretty well for myself, I am constantly messing up with forgetting club meetings, homework, and other stuff. I'd like to get a calendar app to help organize myself without having too much hassle as that would just disnincentivize me from using it. I was wondering if you all had any favorites!

Things I care about:

- EASE OF USE - biggest for me, given the less-than-optimal attention span

- Pretty User interface.

- Support for google calendar
- Good Day-at-a-time view
- If it could somehow integrate Canvas by instructure (where my homework is posted) I will cry tears of happiness. (Maybe IFTTT could do it?)

Things I don't care about 

- Price doesn't really matter as long as it isn't excessive.
- social media integration
- evernote support or similar things I would have recommended Sunrise, it's pretty great nothing else really has all of it's features. Can do Outlook calendar also (which rarely any apps seem to do now), and Google, and Wunderlist todos go on it too which is really great. Also has a special lil keyboard, so if you're telling someone to pick a time you're available, you can put it into the special keyboard, and it would generate a link to a website, let your friend pick the time they want to meet you, and it'd just stick it on your calendar.

Really amazing organization, and great looking. Sorry to get your hopes up though, unfortunately Microsoft bought them and rolled them into the Outlook team and the new Outlook calendar is just not as amazing :( Still trying to figure out what to do about that myself. The calendar was set to officially retire a week or two ago, but since most of it's unique features are still not reimplemented in Outlook yet, they've avoided completely killing it.

I look forward to seeing others' responses to this though. At least Wunderlist is still a thing, I'd love to see another calendar that can login to it and pull data into the calendar too though. Calendar aside, I think the location based reminders you can do with certain apps are absolutely amazing for organization. Not sure if it's everyone though, but it seems like my Google Now location ones rarely ever trigger quite right though, if you ever want to do location based reminders and you're on android I recommend picking up Cortana instead, tends to trigger better.

As for IFTTT like you said, god, I REALLY wish more things worked with IFTTT! It could potentially be amazing, also location based triggers for that would be great I find they fire at really bad places though never seems to be quite right either! I've heard of a few other services similar to IFTTT that have integrations to other services also, but most of the solutions that aren't IFTTT aren't free, I know Microsoft is making one now too it's in beta not sure if it's public yet though or if it's going to be free though I've probably gone through hundreds of apps trying to find the best ones haha. 

My personal favorite is Digical! It has a straightforward interface, it's easy to enter dates/times and copy/paste. It has different calendar views and customizable colors, and it syncs with google calendar. 

And for some more suggestions, a to-do list app I like a lot is TickTick. If you have a lot of assignments it might work better, and it also has a calendar view and limited Google calendar sync. Pettato calendar is the definition of cuteness and has nifty drag and drop stickers, but iirc doesn't sync with google calendar. I also liked June calendar, it has an all-in-one kind of set up. ToDoist.  You can organize everything into projects and then break them down into smaller tasks. You can set reminders and due dates which can sync with iCal or google calendar.

Just recently changed to Omnifocus which is expensive but works great so far. 

The important thing I've learned is to make it a habit to review the calendar daily - twice a day is better. I've found SolCalendar to be a satisfying alternative. It also offers imbedded todo's, though I too use Wunderlist for that.
