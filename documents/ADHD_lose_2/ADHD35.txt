I often forget to reply on whatsapp/facebook because it is too much for me to remember. I feel like a bad friend. When reading e-mails, if I don't have time to respond to them properly I can mark them as 'unread' and prioritize them. I am never behind on e-mails.  


On whatsapp this isn't possible. Unfortunately, sometimes work-related stuff will go mainly on whatsapp (scheduling meetings etc.). Private and professional will mix together.  


The past week I have ignored so many friends on whatsapp because I wanted to reply to them all but never had the chance to do so. This often means I will feel guilty forever while not replying because it is 'too late' or me clinging onto my phone while I actually should be doing other stuff. I had to schedule in replying to informal, friendly text messages. This feels ridiculous.

&#x200B;

I also forget to reply to them alltogether because read whatsapp messages will just sink to the bottom. Acquintances reaching out to me through facebook and whatsapp have found me unapproachable and disinterested. But I'm not, I'm just overwhelmed.  


Can anyone relate? I would like to find a solution but I feel that there is none. The platforms are designed to keep people busy. I also don't feel like it is an option to abandon the platforms. It has helped keeping a lot of low key friendships alive that I cherish so much.

Edit: so I made this post this morning and forgot about it... I didn't expect so many replies! So I'm gonna reply with this edit as I'm sure you'll understand. I am both glad that you guys can relate as that I feel for you! Also thanks for the tip to the user who told me that I can mark whatsapp messages as unread! I am ignoring whatsapp for the night but I'm trying this out tomorrow.

Edit 2: the user who gave me the awesome tip was u/onecoolchic77, Thanks so much!  I've obtained the status of being extremely flaky, never responding to messages (unless it's my wife) and never accepting invitations for parties/work gatherings. I've just embraced it at this point. Everyone thinks I'm lame. Relate? This is my whole life. It's embarrassing and it sucks. I'm behind on emails too so at least you have that down! I do have some great friends that understand that this is just how I am which I'm very thankful for.  On Google, it says you can mark a whatsapp message as unread by tapping and holding it. I know I can mark my text messages as unread. 

On fb messenger, you can't do it. But I will not read some messages on there until I have a minute to respond. I have ADD inattentive type and am constantly forgetting things like this so I have to work hard at remembering to respond. Another thing you can do is, depending on the person, just type a quick message that if you forget to message them back have them send you a reminder. If they are a friend or if it is something important to them, they will understand.  I feel it all the time. The worst part is once you get that 'too late' feeling, it almost feels wrong to message them. I do this a lot so I just have to remind myself, they're you're friends and family. If you take the time to explain why you forget to message back so much and try to remember that it's never too late to message back (that's what texts are for)
Sure at first it'll be more or less the same, you'll forget but if your friends/family are understanding the pressure wont be so high and it'll be less overwhelming to reply a little late.

My friends and family have come to understand that I'm a low effort person, not because I dont care or I dont want to be included. Simply because I'm a forgetful person who is full of insecurities about doing the wrong thing and making people angry. Hope this helps some :) I'm the exact same. Luckily the people i text most know what i'm like and that I'm not doing it on purpose. Sorry I don't have a 'solution' but its normal and doesn't make you a bad person, I promise. Personally I prefer text messaging but I do flake occasionally. Where I really flake is voicemail. I've have voicemail alerts on my phone for a few days until I finally give in and check the damn thing. I'm literally looking at my phone now and thinking, "eh, I'll just do it later". FB allows you to mark messages as unread. But honestly? I don't read messages until I can reply. It's stressful though, getting messages, being expected to reply right away.. if people are used to you taking a few days, but you reply with your full attention, I think it'll be okay. :) Ha!im the worst goddamn friend ever! I don't remember birthdays, anniversaries or funerals! Got bros all up in that afghan mess as contractors,u think i can remember to check if they're still breathing? Hellafukno cuz. I can barely remember my own birthday! In retrospect,could be y im such a social pariah,but tks to denial its mos def everybody elses fault.U cool man I'm the same. I quit Facebook because I just couldn't keep up. Same with e-mail, it can take me weeks to respond, especially when it's to give ppl an update on how everybody is doing. "Is this enough details, should I talk about my son more, would it be construed the wrong way if I mentioned this? Ah, fuck it I'll deal with it later.." then for the next few weeks my ADHD assistant in my head will remind me "you still haven't responded to X. you still haven't responded to X." non-stop until I finally take the time to do it, then it leaves me alone...until I get a response back telling me we should make plans and to let them know of a time that works for me. Ugh! Holy shit, my people! I belong! I've been struggling with this a lot lately and feel super shitty about it. 

I'm a great multitasker, but when it comes to communication with friends or family I wall-up. I tend to over think my responses and will say "I'll come back to it later", but by that time I've already checked the message, the notification is gone and now I've forgotten that someone msged me.

 It's especially hard if I'm at work or out running an errand, I usually have to tell someone... I can't get to this now, can you msg me in 15 to remind me we need to talk about X. My brother and husband are really good about it, but everyone else... not so much. I wish there was an app that kept the msgs from FB, text, Instagram etc unread until you responded or at least hit a button that the task is complete. 

But yahoo I'm not alone, your not alone. We're all in this together!  I relate so much! This same problem recently cost me a second date with someone pretty cool. I completely relate! It happens mostly when I’m overwhelmed. My close friends understand but acquaintances and others get pretty irritated. 

I just explain to people how I am-not in detail but just how I tend to get caught up in things. I do often forget my texts just because I don’t have the mentality to engage in a conversation over the phone.. 

Worrying about others will tear me apart, so I’ve been slowly working to where I can focus more on how I feel instead. I’ll catch up with friends in person when I’m able to rather than over the phone because I can’t handle text conversations as silly as that sounds.. when I’m stressed I just have the capability to only do school work or els I get too anxious and worked up. 

So the advice I’m trying to get at is always put yourself first and if comfortable, be upfront about how you feel if someone gets annoyed or don’t understand. If you’re someone like me who gets overwhelmed and stressed if there’s too much going on at once, take a step back and be there for yourself and reply to messages when you can-no matter how long it takes.  I have this issue as well. A way that I've had some success in coping with it is relying on reading messages from my notification screen (They don't get marked read unless you open the app) unless I know that I can reply then and there. As with a lot of things on this forum, this really struck a chord with me! It's something I struggle with pretty intensely as well. I find the format of communication on things like Facebook messenger (I don't tend to use WhatsApp but I imagine it's similar) means that if I'm going to keep up with the conversation, I have to stop whatever I'm doing when the message comes in and immediately switch my attention from one task to another. So I often put off responding until I'm finished whatever else I'm doing, but it's easy to get distracted and forget to respond because, as you say, the apps tend to bury unread messages and then it gets to a point where its almost embarassing to respond.

What I'm trying to do is to devote time every evening (in practice it's more like every few evenings but I'm working on it) to keep up with personal correspondence via various social media. In the same way that I would methodically work through my emails at a particular time, I'm trying to work through personal messages.

It's not ideal, because it makes keeping up with friends feel like a chore. I'm trying to encourage some of my long distance friends to chat to me on the phone every once in a while instead of messaging me with small talk intermittently, as I find phone calls to be more rewarding, and they allow me to devote time and energy to the friendship without it feeling like its getting in the way of my concentration in other areas.

I'm also trying to separate my personal communication from work, but it's hard when everyone wants to use Facebook group chats for work!

I suppose it's all a process of figuring out different ways of doing things, and of talking to people nd letting them know that the current way isn't working for you. That can be hard in my experience because I hate to ask people for special treatment, but of course that perspective is flawed because we're not asking for special treatment, we're just asking for people to consider that one way doesn't work for everyone!  Fortunately, I've reached a point in my life where none of my friends contact me anymore because they're too busy with their families. 😞 I've started forcing myself to respond when I read it.  Makes me way less likely to not respond.  And then I know when I go into checking texts I have to respond.  So if I do not feel in a response mood, I do not even check, then it stays as a notification.   these addictive apps are very bad for people with ADHD, I recommend avoiding them. Your friends should text you, you should tell them to do so Yes! I've done this countless times. I started going through already read whatsapp messages when I'm bored now. Maybe actively scheduling that in somewhere along the day would help even more. I have half a million unread emails in my AOL account.  Address your anxiety and restructure your life. I would say that this is an anxiety thing more than an ADHD thing.

Something I should you should do is to stop using tools for both business and private purposes. Another thing you can do is to start scheduling when to reply to messages or pick-up old chains you’ve forgotten to maintain; you need to set up a structure that makes your problems more manageable. That’s hilarious, I do the same thing with emails!  I relate to this SO MUCH. It's so frustrating and I'm always in awe of my friends who can be hanging out with me, very much engaged in whatever it is we're doing, WHILE simultaneously texting someone else back and forth, carrying on a full conversation with them as well!! If I need to respond to a message like that, I practically need to drop whatever else it is I'm doing to focus solely on composing my message. And since I'm usually doing multiple things at once to begin with, this is obviously very difficult.

It's very nice to hear that I'm not alone though, especially since none of my friends irl seem to understand what I go through when it comes to this issue, and I've enjoyed reading through the tips and tricks you guys have posted here!  If it works to schedule replying, then don't worry. It works for you, other people get responses, there's no problem with that. Everyone does things differently to help them stay on track. Calenders, planners, we made PDAs just to keep us organized. It's fine to organize your life so you remember to do the things you want to.

I use Facebook messenger for chatting exclusively, because those little chat bubbles stay in my field of view. I also rarely look at chats if I can't reply to them right away,  Same here, I don't understand it and I get this uneasy feeling with unexpected calls. Hi me “hey siri, remind me in three hours to message....”

seriously a lifesaver for me with Iphone and groupme messages I too have these issues. At work, I've left half-composed messages in chat windows for *months* because I clicked off on another "urgent" chat.

The only way I've found to work around it is to not rely solely on memory, ever. I keep bread crumbs, don't work on more than one task per window, respond to real-time alerts immediately, and clean up bread crumbs when the task is done (nothing is worse than "Have I done this already?" or simply ignoring a breadcrumb because *it's always there*).

This means I never switch chats if there's a pending question or response. It's OK for person two to wait a few more minutes while I'm answering person one. When cleaning a room, I never cross thresholds if I can avoid it. I will instead create a pile of dishes at the boundary, fill a bag with trash, move everything that needs to be moved towards its final destination. That way, I can see a pile of dishes, or a filled trash bag, and do the appropriate thing with them at a later point in time if necessary.

Don't rely on your memory alone. It's just going to hurt. This won't work for every situation, but I convinced some of my friends to use Voxer. It's basically a walkie-talkie app, and I've found that it's far easier for me to respond to messages when I just talk, rather than typing things out. I think a big part of why it works for me is that my brain works faster than I can type, and I also get bogged down with making the text "perfect" with punctuation, etc. and I end up putting it all off until it becomes awkward. I’ve given up on having friends.  ☹️. It’s not that I don’t want them, it’s that I forget until I’m falling asleep at 12AM when it’s too late to call or text.  And I just don’t use messenger.  My e-mail?  I never check spam so it has like 24,000 emails but I can’t delete because I use it for sign-ups and need to be able to access it occasionally.

:sigh: at least there is Reddit for my social needs. 1st of all congratulations in having so many friends :) 2nd People who kno me well now kno ot will take them several attempts- including just showing up at my door / desk etc to get my time. Sometimes I just send out a message to all or even post publicly on FB that I’ve reached “peak over schedule” and I love them but may not reply right away. Sometimes this kind of post actually brings the cavalry to come and help! :) This post literally reminded me about a message on Kik that I forgot to respond to from JUNE!!!! I feel terrible omg. I am ADHD's bitch wow i keep a sticky note to-do list, it also involves whom to msg/reply to. if they're close friends, you could be upfront it as well. i have a friend who has similar issues to me with forgetting to reply etc, but we have a mutual understanding and never get upset with each other :) I feel that this is as much a syndrome of our age as it is an individual issue.  Think of how much time and effort goes into a meaningful face to face conversation with a friend.  Now imagine that 3 friends randomly walk up to you at the same time in the middle of doing something else, and want to have a conversation, each requiring the time and attention you just don't have to give at that moment.  This is effectively what instant communication enables, and is a tough juggling act for anyone.  Cut yourself some slack, because in this case, it's the *rest* of the world that's gone crazy. As others have also said here, I've got to the point where I'm happy to tell certain people that if it's important to call cos I may end up not replying like a twat  You can tap and hold on a conversation or group chat and hit "mark unread" in WhatsApp! So a lot of people in the thread have mentioned that they relate to this, but I haven't seen many responses with actual suggestions to help so I thought I'd give my 2 cents.

Someone said that you can mark whatsapp texts as unread and maybe thats an option for you, but I couldn't figure out how to do that on my phone so I'm going to assume its the same for you just in case. What I've found that personally helps is to fight the idea that it is 'too late' to text back. The idea behind texting is that you respond when you are able to. If your friends needed you immediately, they could call instead. Try to keep that in mind if you feel guilty about it.

Next time you forget to respond, just text them back when you realize you forgot. Maybe apologize and make sure they know they are important to you if they texted you days ago, but in my experience most people are pretty understanding about it.

Hope this helps! Write down “check messages” on a daily checklist. Pretty easy fix. Worked for me.  I'm jealous...you sound very on top of things to me! I have 12,102 messages in my email inbox, 106 texts, and 94 unheard voicemail messages.  I know not all of them required a response, but it's still horrifying. I don't dare get Facebook messenger or Whatsapp... What’s app/Facebook is pretty easy to to keep on top of(event scheduling don’t even go there)...emails however LOL, I have 90 unread emails. I’m basically of the notion if it’s important they’ll contact me directly, like fuck am I get getting caught up in Pam and Karans Cc bitch fest. I am known for this amongst my friends. Just tell everyone 'sorry I suck at whatsapp just call me for important stuff'. I admit it helps me that I have hipster friends who dislike social media.  I have worked to ensure I reply to messages straight away as a strategy. Unfortunately it really doesn't work so well when it comes to chatting up girls!  I do this too, all the time. Most of my friends are understanding, but my ex best friend got very mad at me because of it and stopped talking to me. I do literally have  parts of my day that are devoted to responding to messages. I will even add the need to respond to some of the messages to my notes for the day.  Hi, I have been notorious for this exact issue and recently I have gotten *much* better at it! I have set a routine and a Google calendar reminder that after I get my morning coffee, I sit down and respond to any messages I have. I have noticed that by doing this for a few months, I feel less "overwhelmed" by new messages throughout the day and respond to them even when it's not my scheduled time to do so! Yeah.
The only thing i can recommend is not opening up the message until you know how you want to respond. That way it still looks like you have an incoming message. It doesn't always work, but it helps I can relate. I often forget to respond to my friends on Snapchat. But I never tend to worry about it because I'll eventually see them outside in the world. I just talk to them then. Snapchat and Google Allo is SOOO much worse. By the time I get around to replying, the original message is gone & I've usually forgotten the context or subject of the conversation.  TBH, I just accept my ADHD and don't feel bad about it I can't help it, so why stress it. The ones that really matter understand, the rest aren't needed. This is me. Especially the “too late”. I’ll forget for forever, and then remember and struggle for the longest time with how to respond since it took me so long. It gets worse and worse, and then I just assume they don’t want to hear from me. I’ve got a few friends that get it, and I don’t struggle with this even if I’ve been off the radar for a few days. But anyone that I feel like I need to be socially normal with is pretty much screwed. Lol I feel this so hard. I have a good friend who lives in the UK (I live in the US) and often messages me on Facebook. A lot of times I read it and start to reply but never actually finish the message/hit send  This cost me my relationship. 

Shitty excuse, but my ex and I live apart and communicate by text. I'm unmedicated and work major overtime, so they'll have texted while I'm trying to unwind, consuming some other media, and I'd inevitably fall asleep without having replied. 

They got upset with me for not being interested, but I explained to them, we live in the same town. If you want my presence, you have to come and get it (they have the car), that at the end of the day I *do not* have the wherewithal to pay attention to any text conversations. 

Bottom line is they never came around while guilting and blaming me for the problems in the relationship despite having never taken my advice. 

I finally couldn't take enough of the RSD inducing blame game and ended it. Haha same My friends know it's just how my brain works and don't take it personally. Once I realized it wasn't me but the executive functioning of my brain my self-esteem shot right up. Although I still have my nicknames...known as Dory at work.  I've reached that point myself   after so many years of trying to be something different to conform to other people's needs and expectations, I'm happy now to let those who are interested conform to mine. My closest friends know that I will text with them,  and normally will reply with a text, but I also do not have a Facebook or insta or Twitter that I use, and email i check every few days on my main account, and every months or so on my personal private account. ( privacy advocate so way too many emails over the years) 

I stand behind a attraction and activism to privacy , but part of it really is that I am shit at nailing down plans, way to often double book or forget about said event, and really am  a-way to spontaneous person  to lock down on some days ( even without factoring my lovely comorbid pain conditions that sometimes ruin plans on there own) . 

Luckily my wife loves the book of face, doesn’t have adhd, can plan ahead, but also is flexible and if my body says “you are going to fuck off with any plans” she will either go without me, or most likely would rather chill with me. She’s steezy like that and I couldn’t have found another person with so much empathy and that leans into chaos as easily as she does “

So when friends want to hang, they know, hey, if it’s Facebook hit up my wife, if it’s text.. cool... hit me up, and if you are in constant need of friendship validation on posts or something , I’m not your huckleberry, but if you need a friend and you text me I’m always there, and will call or text you back. 

They whole thing is confusing and I’m sure I scare people off, but i try to be forward with people, living in a new city , I’m sure it’s scaring some potential friends off, but it’s what has become my MO, and what works for me. 

So that was a bit of a random rant. I’m leaving it . 🤗 I really should just delete my social media. I never ever check it and when I do, I may have messages from weeks to months earlier that are since irrelevant, so I don't respond to them. People who are close to me know they can just reach me through text. However, there are plenty of acquaintances that don't have my number and probably just think I'm an asshole or lame. 

At this point, leaving my FB up despite me not checking for literally months at a time just seems stupid and almost like a 'fuck you'  to people who would try to reach me their. I'd just post my cell number and say RIP this page but then I'll get far more junk spam calls and texts then friends reaching out (made that mistake in like 2008, I can't imagine it's gotten any better with how FB is these days).  Another solution: don't tap a notification if you're not able to respond to it immediately. Then the notification will stay as a reminder until you're ready.

On Android, you can also partially swipe a notification to the side to access a "snooze" feature, so you can be reminded again later.  You can block a certain cookie for FB messenger which prevents it from ever being marked as read. Can't remember how off the top of my head though.  Ugh, the too late feeling. I live that all the time.  Thank you, I needed to read this. Exactly that.  I see what the message is and decide if I have the mentality to reply quickly or if it needs more time. That way I can stop stressing about having to read it soon and not knowing,  which brings on that overwhelmed feeling.
I still end up having unread messages for days/weeks but at least I know what I need to prepare for once I find a spare bit of energy to respond. It takes the edge off. 
Sometimes just by reading the message quickly, my brain automatically creates a response without trying, which can be enough for me to quickly type it out because the enthusiasm is there. Plus this way, quick reply messages keep the overall message volume down to a manageable level.  I think it's interesting that you say this is more anxiety than ADHD, because it's something I struggle with, and yet my specialist doesn't believe I struggle with anxiety. He says that what seems to be anxiety in adhd folks is often feelings of being overwhelmed, and in the case of message and communication, I find that it's hard to respond because I need to devote a certain amount of brainpower to the task which isn't always available when messages pop up at random moments throughout the day. It's hard to redirect brainpower that I'm using for other tasks that I'm working on when these messages come through. It seems to me that OP has similar problems with overwhelm, but it doesn't (to me at least) seem like anxiety. I suppose adhd affects everyone differently though and there is a lot of overlap between all these disorders! 

However your suggestion to schedule when to reply to messages does sound like an excellent idea. I find structure and routine does overcome a lot of adhd problems!  Are you me? They have to come and get it? 

Jesus. Don't blame ADHD on this, you are being unreasonable here and instead of telling them what the problem is you are acting like some sort of prize. Relationships don't work on your specific requirements. There are two people involved and an apology goes a long way especially when you can explain what's wrong. 

It's bad when we forget to respond and someone feels united. But not being able to realise that they are in their right to complain and not even acknowledge the real problem is what's wrong here.  > If you want my presence, you have to come and get it (they have the car), that at the end of the day I do not have the wherewithal to pay attention to any text conversations.

This is so ridiculous and unreasonable. You were being a bad friend - they should have ended it.  I'm pretty sure my co-workers have accepted this fact as well, that it's just how my brain works. Normally I wouldn't care to tell people at my job about my disorder, but I'm on a ship and stuck with these dudes for a couple of years. They seem to understand, but also crack jokes about how flaky I am from time to time. I've pretty much made it clear that the only time I'll hang out is when we stop at a foreign port because we have to use the buddy system.

I'm glad that your self-esteem elevated, that's super important w/ these weird brains of ours.  >Luckily my wife loves the book of face, doesn’t have adhd, can plan ahead, but also is flexible and if my body says “you are going to fuck off with any plans” she will either go without me, or most likely would rather chill with me. She’s steezy like that and I couldn’t have found another person with so much empathy and that leans into chaos as easily as she does

Same here! I'm seriously so lucky to have married someone with so much patience for my regular antics. I can't plan ahead to save my damn life, we're actually about to go on vacation for the first time in a while and she planned every bit of it. 

My close friends also know to text my wife instead of me if they want to plan visits, haha.  > don't tap a notification if you're not able to respond to it immediately

This is what I do. Otherwise I will completely forget I ever got the message.

>you can also partially swipe a notification to the side to access a "snooze" feature, so you can be reminded again later.

I didn't know that! I'm definitely going to use this. Thanks! Just know for most things it's never too late. I constantly have to remind myself otherwise I will beat myself up whilst still never doing what it is I'm agonizing over not having done. Hey, there was *far* more going on than I posted here. I also have a dissociative disorder, multiple personalities, derealization, etc etc. This is not the place to dump my relationship woes. 

And yes, they could have easily turned right out of work and taken the next driveway into my apartment complex to come give me a hug or get a hug. Less than a tenth of a mile. I constantly begged them to come over and spend time and they never did. I wasn't allowed to go visit them, despite being willing to make the 5mi walk one way to do so, because they lived with their mother and their mother hates me. 

When text is the only medium they communicate with and I tell them consistently that I'm terrible at replying to texts, if they wanted to be around me, they could have visited shortly after work. 

Beyond that, they said they couldn't stand to be around me while I was miserable, despite never being around me to see that I wasn't, only getting the impression that I was miserable because they never came around.

Don't assume I think I'm a prize, I fucking moved back to Arkansas from Seattle to make this relationship work and I've been here for a year with the relationship never materializing on their end. 

In the end, they told me they were planning on moving to another city and left no mention of me in their plans, nor room for me to ask where I fit.

It was then that I realized they really didn't give a shit (like, if they did they'd have come over, right?) And that it was best to just give up and let it end. so the wording here is crap and I never actually said these words to them, but legitimately--the ability to make spending time together was in their hands. They asked me not to come over bc her mom hates me and she didn't want a huge fight. 

Granted I worded it poorly here, but I spent a year begging them to come over more often and explaining that I have to focus on work at work, and the only times they ever messaged were when I was falling asleep. By the time I got home the next day the only thing on my mind was unwinding. Then they message when I'm asleep. Rinse and repeat. I asked them to message earlier, to come over and visit, ***explained that unless they pop up when I'm awake I simply won't remember to reply to texts.*** 

I shouldn't have to fucking justify that experience in a fucking ADHD sub. Not sure if I have ADHD (I haven’t been check for it yet, but am considering), but I can’t remember plans for the life of me and double book all the time and I hate it. I’m also not married so I struggle with this a lot on my own. 

Thankfully if it’s something important, my best friends wife will text me to remind me about it if she’s aware of it. Or if she asked me to bring something over (I go over to their house about once a week) she will text me like an hour or so before and remind me again... even then it can be a toss up though  Sorry, I just went on  what you initially shared, or choice of words perhaps. 

Anyway, the other person in this story sounds pretty childish, I guess you should be happy that you ended it ended when you did. Hopefully you can find someone more mature or already have. Either ways, good luck :) Thanks :)

And yeah, probably word choice. It's hard to condense a year of shit into a single comment and keep it related to the topic so I had to go with what got written before it got tangential.
