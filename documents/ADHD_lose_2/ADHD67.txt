Gym lockers Moments when you know you have ADD : when, for the third time this week, you can't remember which gym locker you locked your stuff in just an hour ago.  I use my phone for music while I work out so I would always snap a photo of my locker just for this reason.  Buy a really distinct lock  My problem is I tell myself I will remember. Give it 5 minutes and of course I fucking forget lmao I try and put it in the same locker, every time I go Yeah, I do the same. I usually just write it down in the Notes app.  Good idea.. I guess I never considered I would forget it despite always forgetting it  They have built in locks...  Ah... Then maybe leave a sticky note
