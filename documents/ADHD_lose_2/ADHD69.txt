cut my nails outside my shrink's office yesterday cause I didn't get time before I left the house and had the executive function to problem solve instantly and put them nailclipper in my pocket in case I arrived with time to spare. filing under progress with a splash of slightly odd. “Filing under progress with a splash of odd” 😂 love it!

Good job clipping your nails, I always forget! And then remember! And then forget! Man, this is so funny and relatable. As a guitar player my nails on my left hand have to stay low and if I didn't play I don't think I would ever cut them. I carry a whole nail kit around in my bag and keep nail clippers in my car because I know that I will get to a show or practice and realize 5 minutes before that I need to cut them. Same, which is why I put the clippers in my pocket. my job is essentially to type stuff into a keyboard most of the time... drives me mad when they are even a little long.... you'd think I'd get up and clip them right then and there buuuuuuuuuut..nope the paranoid side of my adhd tells me if I carry them around somebody is gonna try arrest me thinking I want to use them as a weapon. You know, I used to keep not just a set of clippers in my bag but also cuticle nippers so I could get the little dead skins off before I peeled them and made them bleed since I can’t stop myself. But it didn’t work because I forgot I had the kit in my purse and then I eventually lost it. 😂 yeah I have five clippers in the house, all have been "lost" and found again.
