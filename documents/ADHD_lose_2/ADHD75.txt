Biggest lie I (accidentally) tell at work: “Okay, boss! I’ll do it right now” Because then I walk away fully intending to do the thing, see something that reminds me of who knows what, and then the boss asks me “hey is that thing done?” and I’m just like oh. Maybe I need a pocket notebook or something.  You need to carry a pocket notebook! or index cards or post-its.

if you get a lot of instructions at work when you're not at your desk, it's just inevitable.   at my last job I just had to walk around the corner and also, past the coffee area ...so if someone even just said hello, i was toast. or i would get back to my desk and already have new emails and completely forget what I was just asked to do. Based on advice someone gave me here, I carry a small notebook and write in it things that I need to do after meeting with my boss.  It only took one “Did you forget?” to make me carry my notebook everywhere.  I also have a post-it notes in my notebook that I write my random thoughts on so I don’t blurt in meetings.  It has really helped me.  Pocket notebooks are the key. I used to have meetings and would tell them "Email me or I'll forget". Of course, if they don't email me, I'll forget it and then fall back to "well, I asked you to send me an email reminder".

A pocket notebook makes me seem a bit more professional. Don't use apps. Too easy to see another app and get distracted.
