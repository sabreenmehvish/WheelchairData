A large part of ADHD for me is that I know I know things, I just can‚Äôt recall them at the right time, most of the time. And sometimes my brain will remind me of a to-do at the exact wrong time when I can‚Äôt do it or write it down somewhere. Sometimes I think my friends think I‚Äôm lying about stuff like having seen a movie or listening to an album, that I‚Äôve been to a certain place, etc., because I know I have, but I can‚Äôt remember anything about it during the conversation.  My meds help a little bit but man I wish I had better recall, both socially and and at work. 


Edit:  I was not expecting such a grand response and I want to say thank you to all of you kind internet strangers for making me feel not alone.  It helps so much to know others relate!!

Edit: RIP my inbox It makes me look a liar whenever that happens. The dumbfounded looks I receive is a plus, too. I'm not a memory bank, people. I can't remember that one movie I saw 10 years ago, but you bet your ass I'll slowly recollect the memories if I rewatch it. It may look like I'm watching it for the first time, but be patient with me and stop asking "Are you sure you watched this before". 

Same goes for songs, too. I don't remember the title of the song nor the artist, but the song itself is memorable. And don't correct me if I sing the lyrics wrong, which happens more often than I'd like. It helps to sing it in gibberish, though, so I don't get caught. Lol One of my biggest issues with my boss has consistently been that I can't answer a question when I'm caught off-guard, so when he comes by my desks and starts asking me stuff I get super stressed out and I apparently have a really expressive face and when I'm stressed or confused I look like I'm annoyed and so he'd flip at me for being rude and not answering him. We've been working together for almost 5 years now and it's only been over the last year and a bit that this stuff has started to get better as we have both taken the initiative to try to understand each other better. 

Funny thing is, I was only diagnosed with ADHD a couple of weeks ago so I'm still learning how much of this stuff is related to that and how much of it is just me. I haven't said anything to my boss and haven't decided yet whether I will or not. Will kind of depend on how helpful I find meds once I start them (appt coming up in a couple weeks). 

I have the same issue as you with my social life and relationship - it's very frustrating but it's nice to now have an answer for WHY I'm like that. My fiance is very patient and even before we learned I have ADHD he always just kind of accepted my quirks and helps me manage my life. He reminds me when I've already told him something, or if I haven't. He doesn't get annoyed when I forget we already had a conversation or when I forget details about stuff. 

I have always found it really frustrating try to remember my own life... like, when friends and I are all reminiscing about old times I often mix things up and think that a memory I have was from a certain outing when it was actually a different one, etc. It's especially frustrating because most of the time if I'm corrected on it I will just assume they are right, because that's usually the case), but sometimes I am SO sure I'm right but don't stand up for it and then find out down the line that I was right after all. That's actually happened a couple times recently with my fiance and I get so upset! I hate not trusting my own memory.  I often pause when I'm speaking because I've misplaced a word in my brain. It's annoying for the listener. My husband doesn't have this problem. He just plows ahead with the wrong word. What a team. I feel you. A similar annoying thing is not knowing the words to songs. I could have heard the song a million times and I‚Äôd still look like I don‚Äôt actually know it. 

‚ÄúI swear, this really is my favorite band! Even though I can‚Äôt remember any album names or the names of my favorite songs, or the band member‚Äôs names...‚Äù This subreddit is basically a support group for me...  now combine this with depression and anxiety and we need a new name  Yeah, that's probably one of the hardest parts.  Socially is the worst because I always feel like I'm just catching up the conversation. Ppl always think I‚Äôm not paying attention to their stories because I always forget, they literally think I don‚Äôt care but actually I care too much I just have bad memory I have profound trouble with remembering anything that happened in a movie or book I've read to the point that I can't have a productive conversation about them.   Just validating your experience and that it's the same for me. This hits me most often with Names. One of the greatest ways to show a someone you don't know exceptionally well that you care for and appreciate them, is to use their name. I know people's names. But I know their names later that night, when I'm laying in bed recanting my day. In the moment, I have to try to pierce through a foggy wall of thought to find their name somewhere in my mind. 

They say my name, and i cant seem to find theirs. Every time man.

Same as most folks with ADHD, I am quite an empathetic person, I strive to make people feel welcome, accepted, and cared for. Makes me seem like an arrogant jerk when its my third time interacting with someone and I cant find their name. ADHD has nothing to do with attention or hyperactivity. It's an impulse control disorder caused largely by deficiencies in executive functioning. If they would change the fucking name to something that actually makes sense and relates to the disorder it's likely people would belittle it less. 

When you say you can't focus, have a deficit of attention, or are hyper, people can't grasp why that's an issue. Everyone has trouble focusing, everyone can be hyper to a certain degree. Sit still and stop moving, stop fidgeting, just try harder, just need to focus, stop being lazy! They can't relate. Frame it as an impulse control disorder though? Now they get it. Everyone understands issues controlling your impulses because the majority of adults have at some point or another gotten too drunk. They realize that when you lack control over your impulses it's a shitty feeling that is incredibly hard to reign in when it gets going. 

The best way I've figured out to describe it is that everyone has a little CEO in their brain running the show. Most people have a CEO that is fairly competent at doing his job. People with ADHD have the infrastructure, business model, products, etc... but they hired an incompetent jackass to run the show and he's tanking the company. Our CEO can't handle his job on a normal day meanwhile most days the office is on fire and someone's trying to kill him. 

&#x200B; I've only been diagnosed about 2 weeks ago now, but hearing other people describe things I've struggled with but still haven't associated with ADHD yet is so therapeutic and it's helping me accept who I am. Really glad this sub exists :) 

I love film and television, and I'll be talking to my brother about something we both enjoyed and he'll look at me like I'm either lying or brain dead when I can't recall key scenes he tries to talk about :') I really struggle to remember songs I've saved on Spotify too unless I can see the album artwork  Makes me feel like a fucking asshole. I work in a research lab (bio), and I feel like such a fraud when I can‚Äôt answer questions abt smth I worked on 6+ months ago... everyone else can remember it, but personally I usually have to reference my notebook for it to all rush back :( I hate this so much! It is one of my least favorite parts of myself. Because I can know something, truly and deeply know it for sure, and yet not be able to explain why or back it up. My evidence is more like thought patterns and loops and pictures until everything clicks into the textbook facts about three days later and I just end up looking stupid for trying to contribute to the conversation.  I do this too, but in my case it makes me *very* good on tests, especially multiple choice ones. The simple fact that I can see the answer in front of me reminds me that it is the answer.

On the other hand, it makes free response questions more difficult. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE WORDS TO EXPLAIN THIS TO MY PSYCHIATRIST THIS IS EXACTLY IT!!!! Sorry for shouting but seriously I can finish a book, walk outside to tell my roommate I finished a book and they say oh cool what was it called? Hmm I don‚Äôt remember. What was it about? Uhhhhh nope can‚Äôt think of that either but it was GREAT.  Hey let me go look really quick to jog my memory, you would love it. Hmm wonder what I‚Äôm in my room for. Goes back out for snack 3 seconds later. Roommate: so what‚Äôs it called? Me: what‚Äôs what called?üòÇ oh!  The umm not the movie but the other thing what was it? Roommate: THE BOOK. Oh yea it‚Äôs uh starts with a b hmm I can picture it!!! Let me go look...CYCLE CONTINUES. WE‚ÄôRE STUCK IN A NON-BOOK-KNOWING VORTEX OF DOOM My husband is sick of me saying "Oh I actually knew that", after everything he says. I like, *half*-know things  For me, it's like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOXsi682OgA) I know how you feel. I failed my master‚Äôs defense because it was an oral exam but easily passed as soon as they let me take a written. 

What also really sucks is a lot of my colleagues come in and ask me questions about projects I‚Äôm working on WHILE I‚Äôm working in the lab and I just absolutely sound like I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. 

I‚Äôve just started telling them to check my lab notebook (electronic) or I‚Äôll tell them I‚Äôll write an email.  *(forgets a specific word mid-conversation and then proceeds to play The Thesaurus Game for the next 5 minutes, completely derailing the conversation and never finding the exact word I wanted to use)*

(37 hours later)

(remembers the word, but it's too late) This is one of the most frustrating things. I feel like I need to retrace my steps to remember something. It‚Äôs a huge problem because I‚Äôm going into academia where everything builds on itself. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt have access to everything I know.  This 110% describes my ADHD. And on top of that I will forget simple words in the middle of sentences like chair or schedule. It's crazy! Yup. It's the absolute *worst* in school when a teacher randomly calls on you asking for the answer right then and there. I would say "I don't know" probably 9 times out of 10. this happens to me so frequently. i feel like it‚Äôs not necessarily like the WRONG time as much as it just isn‚Äôt when i need it. my girlfriend makes fun of how strange my memory is. i‚Äôll remember the first thing i said to her on tinder 2 and a half years ago, but not what she wanted for her birthday...which she told me last week... Same, also bad is diving head first into a debate in which I have decent knowledge of the subject matter and begin focused, but forget exactly what my argument was without an immediate response.  The to do at wrong times thing happens to me a lot. I always think of stuff I need to do at night, or I just want to do those things then. I think so much more clearly at night, and I get more done if I actually start on things. So there I am, relaxing with my girlfriend watching TV and I'll have the urge to go work on my car, or apply for jobs or something else that you primarily do during the day. It sucks. Anyone else have this? I feel the same way, the three hardest things about adhd are the nonstop kusic/lecture/just straight babbling in the back of your mind, the inability to start or focus once youve started to do something, and the issues with memory. Ill be standing there, talking about conputers, which is one of my favorite subjects, and midsentence, Ill forget what one of the names of the major components. One time, I couldnt remember Cpu, so I, in my infinite wisdom, described it as the thinky metal peice on the motherboard. FFS sometimes I hate myself. This happens to me all the time. My memory is extremely context-dependent.  The second sentence of your title is exactly why I havent gotten my oil change yet. Everytime I think about it I dont have time to do it. And every time I have time to get it done, i dont remember that i need to get it done. Hey, you might like this video. Dr. Russel Barkley talks about this problem at about the 2 minute mark. https://youtu.be/JowPOqRmxNs. One word: Siri.

I ALWAYS remember stuff at the most inopportune times. So I just pick up my phone, hold the home button down, and say:

‚ÄúHey Siri, remind me in 30 minutes that I wanted to read that one article.‚Äù
‚ÄúHey Siri. Remind me on November 3 at 2:00pm to mail that check‚Äù 

And so on. Seriously. Amazing.  It's especially bad when you're tired. Your brain just feels like it hits a wall with all that precious information behind it. This happens to me ALL THE TIME. The worst is when a topic comes up in conversation that I read an article or something about earlier, but I cant remember enough to add anything meaningful or even properly articulate the general concept of what I read. Thankfully most of my friends have ADHD (we are an eclectic bunch, ha) so our conversations tend to be all over the place anyway. I get you, I'm the same. In work I keep forgetting the names of simple tools even though I used them everyday for 4 years! Also I'm absolutely terrible with names. I can't remember most movies that I've seen. This is especially problematic with large franchises that seem to turn out 2-3 movies per year like Marvel. I always have to read summaries of past movies before seeing a new one so that I can remember what I've already watched. üôÉ I have this same issue while taking an exam. I will be taking an exam in a math class and all I can think about is everything BUT math I spend half my day saying shit like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that guy‚Äôs name? You know with the...thing on the...he worked with that lady...they both had...ah forget I...JOHN!‚Äù Ever tried google keep? It was a life changer for me. Forgot the dogs food? Make a note. Low on tp? Make a note. Over hear someone talking about a blog that seems interesting? Make a note. Just don‚Äôt forget to check your notes. ALL THE TIME!!!!! I relate to this so much!! I always think of things when I'm driving or showering. Then I mist mentally check it off as soon as I get somewhere ans can address what I remembered.  Oh my gosh. This is me, all the time. Especially when it comes to a TV show...My roommates and I were watching Better Call Saul Season 4 weekly on TV and every single week I needed a complete refresher on what happened the previous week, EVEN THOUGH I WATCHED IT AND LOVED EACH AND EVERY EPISODE. Fuck. I just got home from class thinking about "maybe I'm just really bad at taking tests" and this post actually sums it up pretty well. My fucking life.

Short term memory - goldfish.
Long term memory - bank vault.

Short term memory after 3 hours when I don‚Äôt fucking need the information anymore - all systems go.

Go to the supermarket and to get 5 items without a list, come back with 3 of them and 4 other things I impulsively bought. This is so me. I forget words often, even though I have a large vocabulary. I forget books I just read and rarely know the title (Goodreads was a lifesaver for awhile, but it‚Äôs really frustrating to have read hundreds of books in my lifetime and not be able to remember most of them). I can‚Äôt remember names for shit so I don‚Äôt really try, unless it‚Äôs someone I know I have to talk to all the time. 

The best was the time when I was in high school that I was looking at a good friend, wracking my brain trying to remember her name. Finally I remembered that we both had the exact same first name. üòë Omg same.

Also noticed I can remember appointments and things if I think about it but I usually don‚Äôt remember to remember.

Like if someone asked me when my appointment is I could probably tell them, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll remember to go on the day. It‚Äôs weird and annoying.  A few years ago my psychiatrist dx'd me with ADD/ADHD and I was surprised because I didn't realize the symptoms I have could be attributed to this. 

My doctor moved and my treatment for it stopped, it looks like I need to get back on some meds for it.

I really need to learn more because I'm surprised again that these "forgetful" symptoms are also part of it. Thanks for posting. I have a theory about this, and it was an insight I gained about my own ADD. In essence, ADD is a great way to dodge responsibility, so my experience is that my mind "hides things" from me when they're relevant (not noticing, forgetting, etc.) but when I'm in no position to take any action (i.e., in a situation where I'm not responsible), these things will come flooding back.

And, you're right, once I develop a method of capturing those particular things when I'm away, I'll forget to use them. It's literally like some part of my mind _doesn't want to_ remember things. Yeah everybody that I know and loves name being the most hilarious not to have access to when I need to introduce them.. Wow, it feels kind of comforting to know others struggle with this too! I can learn fast, sometimes incredibly fast, but my memory works in strange ways and sometimes it's like I can't remember anything of what I want to remember - then, when I don't need to remember it anymore, it pops up out of nowhere. Also I'm terrible with names. I can remember the plot of movies and books, or what someone told me, but I have no idea what the title is, or who told me whatever it was.  For me, the right time tends to be when people at my work (which is a research institute with rather rapid turnover) say: 'Hi, remember me from my job talk 2 months ago? We talked for 30min' and I am like 'Yes, sure, remind me, what did we talk about'... I can remember the science, but I forget people, and I definitely cannot make the connection between a person and a topic. I am always afraid that people think I don't care about them. I do - I just cannot remember. Interesting observation OP.

&#x200B;

A classic for me is when someone asks me to tell them a joke. I don't know any. But there are thousands of jokes you could tell to me that I would have heard before... and still know and love.  I'm so glad I'm not the only one! It's so hard to explain this to people who don't have ADHD. I have sat through two hour long movies in the theatre and come out having no idea what I just watched. What plot? What character? My eyes might have been there but my brain was in a different world. Don't know if anyone has already mentioned this: but I can watch a show for 5 episodes in a row and when someone asks me a question about what's going on, it's hard to explain because I can't remember many of the characters' names!!! I KNOW them but why can't I tell you now uuuuuugh OH MY GOD YES I never would have thought to associate memory loss with ADHD. I just thought I had a shitty memory. Wow, what an eye opener!

Thank you for posting this!  It's like this weird kind of social performance anxiety, I think. Same thing happens to me when I am taking tests in a room with other people. Alone? I can do just fine on a test.  Yessss. Especially with movies or albums. So many times someone will mention an album that I heard and remembered liking a lot so I'll be like "oh yeah I liked that album a lot." Then they ask me my favorite song from it and I stare at them blankly. I love how I know things and how they work but can't vocalize it. "Oh, you know, the thing does the majig and then this process happens and it's so cool" 

Yeah. Real professional sounding there.  My god this is a classic. I am HATING on my ADD today. Let‚Äôs all hang in there. Happy Thursday all üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è All.
The.
Goram.
Time....

It's maddening. It's been three weeks since I borrowed tools from Advanced Auto Parts to fix my fan clutch. The ONE time I remembered (actually I was reminded),  I immediately went to return the tools... The system was down and the place was closed.... That was LAST WEEK... üòì I HAVE to finish painting today (don't ask) and then hopefully if I have time I will take the tools to them. I have to go to Costco to load up on fizzy water too, so maybe I can get a two for one done....! 

...but I will forget all of that as soon as I start painting and it will be another week. But sure as shit I'll remember as I'm knee deep in work, when I can't do a thing about it. 

Keep pressing on, dear Redditor. I hope today, that you remember everything you should AND at an appropriate time to do so. ü§ôüèª Get a notepad app for your phone! :) Yep. My whole life Yup Try carrying a notebook everywhere.  Make it one that you can truly carry *everywhere*.

I carry [this](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B003EVLFJM/) but [these](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/8867320432/) are even smaller.  Both are soft so they fit in pockets.  If there is any doubt as to whether it will fit you might even get the tiny one as an adjunct to your main one... just make sure you extract everything regularly (tear-out pages on the tiny one help).

Things like GTD and Bullet Journal methodologies help index and extract your notes.  Make sure you keep up with the process and don't spend energy on keeping it perfect.

Now you might try making notes on your impressions/opinions of the movie or song, or thoughts inspired by it.  You can refer to it (if it's recent enough) when it comes up in conversation.  Friends might find it a little funny but they won't doubt you saw it any more, and there are worse things than being the creative one in the group who's "always writing and thinking".  Who knows, maybe you build on some of your thoughts, maybe post them somewhere, maybe you have a new creative outlet. I have books on books for reference material and a note book acts as my brain dump. I just don't trust how selective my brain works with memory. Everything needs something to relate to, if not I forget i.e. a persons name will be tied to a body feature of theirs or something they look like. I feel the same way. I sometimes wonder how much this is multiplied due to numerous concussions i've had from biking accidents over the years. Anybody else know the adhd/brain damage struggle? Oh man have I been here! I had a midterm yesterday where we received the essay portion beforehand. Literally half an hour before my exam, I practiced writing my essay and it was beautiful. It flowed, answered the question succinctly, and provided all the evidence to back it up. 

I get to my exam and... I can‚Äôt even remember. My mind is going in a million different directions, everything is bubbling up in my head to the point where it‚Äôs deafening and I just have nothing. I poop out a really sorry excuse that is completely discombobulated and full of errors even though I knew the material like the back of my hand. But of course, when my TA goes to grade it, it‚Äôs not going to look like that. 

Sad ): This post is at a good time bc I just had a huge childhood memory cache dropped on me. Like I'll deadass forget most things about my childhood/adolescence until I remember them at 1am I have the exact same problem. Actually all the same problem of the people in this subreddit.
And still, when I went to ask to my GP (doctor) whether I had adhd he said "most probably not. Maybe it's just a bit of anxiety and depression"
And now I'm even more confused...  My god. Are you me? Shayna is that me in there? Hello? I teach at Uni, and before that school, and this was (and continues to be) the bane of my life. Really awkward when I've given talks in public and totally blanked.  Same, so much. I always remember it a few hours after I‚Äôm not around the person.  https://youtu.be/7tnCVI94kQ0 I sometimes wonder if the French term l‚Äôesprit l‚Äôescalier (google it!) indicates adhd has been with us a very long time, because I experience that delayed thought reaction constantly. This happens to me all the time, with school related stuff and pop culture. Like people will be talking about a movie or show I know I've seen, but I cant remember enough about it to contribute to conversations, even if its like my favorite show When I have random tasks/concerns pop into my head, I quickly enter them into my ToDoIst app.

It helps me recall wtf i need to do, how to prioritize, and have a more productive day.

&#x200B; Oh I totally relate. A lot happens with music actually.

Someone plays an instrumental version of a song and I'm like "I know this!" and they ask me what it is and I can't recall the song or artist but I KNOW it. Then they think I'm lying to make it sound like I totally know they're music taste or something or other. People are so judgmental over music, too. Or there's an obscure song with lyrics and I don't remember the name or band of it then I randomly sing parts of it and people say I know it and I really don't remember the technicalities.

Or I know something, like a theory or concept, and people ask me to explain and I honestly can't. I'm sure you get what I mean, how our minds think in a way. Not to be all "omg our minds think differently" but I feel it's a collective thing with ADHD where our mind thinks of stuff and understands stuff but we literally can't explain it. But we know. Then people think we're lying to sound smart.

To-Do's are the worst. I have the same problem and otherwise, I'm THAT person who stops for like 2 minutes and puts appointments, meetings, etc it in their Google Calendar with 4+ reminders of it.

A week before
A day before
3 hours before
1 hour before
etc.

I lost my phone at a bar I went to with my friend, luckily it wasn't busy and the server found it, put it in the back, and I got it the next day. I honestly panicked so much and it was literally 90% over having a 'watch' with me and having my alarms and reminders. That morning before they called my friend's phone about it, I woke up at 8am and for 2 hours straight laid there tossing and turning because THE BIGGEST assistive device for my shit memory is my phone. Happens to me during written exams. The time constraints especially are the worst. I had finals the last month and each paper is three hours. For the life of me i couldnt recollect all the info and arrange it neatly in the form of legible answers in three frikking hours. Im dreading the results which are to be out any day now. 


And what i hate about the thing is that people less deserving than me are going to pass because they ‚Äòstudied harder‚Äô. Im by no means discrediting them but it‚Äôs just not a fair test system. Is all im saying. I hate this This is me in every single classroom I‚Äôve ever been in. I sit and listen to the lecture and then when the test comes I don‚Äôt get it.  I have this issue as well.

Another issue I run into is often times, when I come to a conclusion on something, I will store that conclusion in my memory and completely discard the reasons and thought process that led to that conclusion. I do this at work all the time. "I know I had a really good reason for designing it that way at the time, but I can't remember what it was." Ahhh! Oh my god. I am genuinely trying to give info on a fraud case which I'm sure involves human trafficking to the police. I see it all see all the connections. Know that it would take them a month to make all these connections and I CANNOT FUCKING ARTICULATE IT. and no I'm not lying. I have 20000 photos of evidence I've got together on a personal fraud that I then worked out was not just manipulation but actually involved many false personas and is in fucking Spanish (which I learned fluently in three months like anyone will believe that) but how the fuck do I articulate it to the police. The guy came and onedrive didn't work..then I have tried to concisely get this stuff all together to give him the Top Ten incidents of 3 years of being manipulated by these people and how the fuck do i do that. It is the whole picture they need or none of it as far as I can see. I have names addresses phone numbers. This is impossible in my non native language.. Fucking hell A big chunk of my life I thought I only had depression and anxiety, and I‚Äôve just recently discovered that ADHD can have different characteristics in females than men. I had literally no idea until I read like a symptom sheet, but my point is this happens to me all. the. time. 

Things I kNOW i‚Äôve read or seen, when people talk to me or even say something super fast, I know what I‚Äôve heard/seen but can‚Äôt remember when asked about it later. Memories have to be explained ‚Äúscene for scene‚Äù by someone who was also there before I start actually remembering the events‚Äîeven though I KNOW the events. 

It‚Äôs weird but oddly reassuring that I don‚Äôt have early alzheimers but do in fact have ADHD. I can definitely relate to this. I'm a filmmaker who just went through grad school and one of the most favorite past times of most filmmakers is just randomly name dropping directors and movies and expecting everyone to be in on the reference. I'm always the one who's like, "I actually don't think I've seen that," and then, halfway through their synopsis I go, "Oh is this the one with the periodic dramatic cutaway to the long hallway? I've seen that!" I think I literally drove one of my professors crazy because I did this with nearly every film she mentioned in our meetings! This! I can totally relate to this. To the point where sometimes I forget people's names that I obviously know. I've been in situations where I go to introduce someone and blank on their name or I trip up when talking because I can't recall pretty basic words that I know. 

I can sometimes rewatch a movie and can't believe how much I missed or didn't remember. At work I forget a lot of things that I've worked on and I need to physically reopen and look at the thing in question to properly recall if I worked on it because I can't remember just by the name or talking about it. It's definitely frustrating and makes it look like I don't care but its not that at all.  I think it affects us differently, for my part I can recall most things that I learn in class or read in a book.  Those things get repeated multiple times, through the teacher repeating the same information in a different way or through reading a passage again cause I lost my spot (which happens often).  Things that I only hear or think about once pass in one ear and out the other though. this is me in school. I know so much stuff in preparation for an exam, but i end up failing it because I don‚Äôt pay close enough attention to the problems or what it‚Äôs specifically asking. That or the wording is weird, and i get something completely wrong, or i‚Äôll fuck up the numbers in a problem and get the wrong answer. ADHD really sucks man, especially when it‚Äôs severe Ahhhh it me This too, but it also makes me feel dumb. The tension between someone's question and the silence due to my inability to retrieve the memory of something I'm sure I have experience destroys my self confidence. EXACTLY AHHHHHH I LOOK LIKE I AM LYING SOMETIMES I run into the thing where if I‚Äôm put on the spot‚Äî‚Äúwhere did you put the bag?!‚Äù‚Äîespecially if it‚Äôs stressful, I completely blank. I know where the bag is, and I know I know where the bag is, but my mind will NOT let me recall it in the moment.

Same thing in an argument‚Äî‚Äúgive me an example of when that‚Äôs happened before.‚Äù Me: ‚Äúuuuuhhhhh...‚Äù I so relate to this!  I forget people's names I work with all the time.  I know them I just can't say them - Leticia become Alycia, Jamie becomes Terri etc... I remember something they thought I was too stupid to understand and they say " Oh, she's so sneaky!"... Ugh the music one for me hits home so hard. Even some of my favourite songs by my favourite artists I'll hear randomly and be like "OH I love this song!!" But then don't know the name or whos singing it at the time üòÇ Man, I had an embarrassing moment with movies in particular. I visited a friend and the roommate seemed unhappy that I was there. Then I found out she was really into French cinema. Great; I was really into French New Wave movies a year ago! She seemed excited to meet another fan. Then I tried to have a conversation with her about it, but I couldn't remember a single fucking title, so I just looked like an asshole who decided to pretend I had the same taste in movies as her for no good reason. I'm pretty sure she hated me after that lol.
 Mm. This.  Make me feel dumb. And a liar. 

But I DO recall more when I start talking. Or reading/watching a movie. It just sounds like I make stuff up on the go..m This is something that annoys me about gatekeeping behaviours like "If you're really a fan of this TV show name 5 episodes and what goes on with them from start to finish". Yeah dude, I watch it and love it, but if you're gonna quiz me on it you can go pound sand.  Can relate to this so hard!!! I'm a pretty expressive person too, and the act of trying to remember makes me look so unsure that people don't believe the shit I say sometimes... And the seeming like a liar bit sucks because of how I'm adverse to negative reinforcements, they stick so hard so when you get the feeling and have to fight the feeling of trying to correct your "mistake"  I love being able to rewatch movies for the first time. Probably the only positive I get from having ADD. THANK YOU. Didn‚Äôt know if it was definitely adhd but this is exactly how it be.  Ugh...this is kind of what led to my best friend and I drifting so far apart. She is a reference queen and even if I saw/experienced it too, I usually have a hard time remembering what shes talking about, so she starts to get the idea that I just dont share the same interests in genres or whatever.  I think i just have a complete inability to remember song lyrics, because all of my friends can remember the words to as many songs as they want and i can only get like 5-10 songs that i‚Äôve listened to for three years or so I was taking a walk with my gf today and I noticed this in myself for the first time! She and I were talking about a song we listened to a few days prior, and while I remember listening to the song and that I liked it, I couldn‚Äôt remember anything about it musically.  my favorite quote is "ah, that's gonna bother me" then immediately running to Google to look up an actors name or try to guess a movie by a quick glimpse of a scene you saw while walking past the cafe to get to the bathroom at a supermarket. trust me, this has happened to me so many times, I think of it more as a challenge and I try not to give up until I find it.  I play a lot of board games and except for the ones I play every other day I never remember the rules until I sit down in front of the setup. The not trusting my own memory thing hits home. I have a hell of a time reminiscing with friends. I can‚Äôt remember if I was at a certain party or whatever, and they‚Äôre like yeah! You were there! And I‚Äôm like OK‚Ä¶ Cool....I was there...what happened...   It's a good thing that you don't answer the question. I developed a habit of answering yes or no when I hadn't given myself time to think, or even understand the question, just because I felt pressured to say something. I now have a rule that I won't make a decision before I've had time alone to think about it.

One of the first things I noticed that was off about my daughter after she learned to talk was that she never answered questions. She always responded, but what she said was never directly related to what she'd just been asked. It was like she just didn't have the machinery for question-answering. The not trusting my memory thing happens a lot for me too. My mom has a very good memory and is very punctual, I am neither. I remembered something she had said/did incorrectly at our last get together and pointed it out to her, mainly as a "hey I remembered this" rather than a "hey you did something wrong haha", but also as a "don't let this happen this year". Nothing important, nothing embarrassing but stil.. 

She responded that I was wrong, it didn't happen that way and no one else remembered/cared. I remember random stupid nonsensical things (it comes in handy sometimes, but not often), this was one of those times. She claimed it didn't happen that way and I told her I was sure it did. She responded with something to the effect of "think about my memory and think about yours, now think about who is right". 

It hurt my feelings because I remember what she said, not even what started the convo, but I remember how sure I was that I was right and how no one stood up for me or supported me. My husband was sorry for not being in the room at that time and said he would've backed me up even though he had no idea what we were talking about, he even offered to go tell my mom that he remembered it like I did just to help me but I didn't let him. 

It's nice to have spouses who support our various quirks and such and I'm glad you've found a good one too! üôÇ Congrats on the "fiance" status! I didn‚Äôt realize the bad memory stuff was adhd...shit.  I really struggle with cold calling in law school.  And, I‚Äôll read everything but still have terrible recall on the spot.  It looks like I haven‚Äôt done shit, though.  It‚Äôs embarrassing.  I‚Äôm the same at work, too.  Is there anything to do to fix this? I don't bother reminiscing with people very much for that exact reason - because I don't trust my memory. Of course, I have no trouble forgetting past mistakes, sigh. Buy these:

Seriously. Just do it. They're basically the only two legitimately worthwhile books on the subject. Everything else just find good resources online and talk to people on this subreddit. 1st book is in particular useful for 1) understanding how other people have to deal with your bullshit 2) having those people read it so they understand your bullshit and are better set up to cope with your bullshit. 

/u/snootsnort I would probably advise against telling your boss about it. There's still a stigma surrounding ADHD and telling people can make them almost start expecting you to work poorly or view your work as poor. I haven't even told my family lol, but [some of] my friends know. A lot of people still consider it to be made up or an excuse to be lazy or forgetful, so I don't even bother most of the time. I know it's a personal matter to decide whether or not to tell your boss, but personally, I recommend being up front with your employer about it for a few reasons. 

One, regardless of the meds you'll be prescribed, they're going to have a varying, but noticeable, effect on your behavior and mood. This is *especially* true when dialing in a new dosage or changing meds. Also, depending on the type of med, come up and comedown can cause massive issues with your focus and mood

Two, you have an actual diagnosed mental disability. Now that you know you have it, you can seek tools and workflows better suited to your brain. I've talked things over with my boss and now extend my work day by 15 minutes to allow for three 5 minute "focus breaks" which involves me just getting up and walking around the building for a few. My boss understands now that if I sit for too long staring at spreadsheets and code, my brain fizzles out and I lose productivity. 

Three, if you're prescribed a stimulant and in a job that may drug test you, you're going to get flagged. Vyvanse and Adderall are both amphetamines, so make sure you bring a copy of your script or the bottle to the testing location. This is one of the things that honestly bugs me the most. I have a fairly extensive vocabulary but for some reason I get caught up on a word and can't remember it. I know it enough to know what's not the word when people try to suggest words, and enough to define the word, but just not the word itself. Usually the word suddenly dawns on me... 15 minutes to an hour after the conversation...   My catchphrase in life these days I swear is "what's that word I'm thinking of?" Because I say it quietly in a good chunk of my daily life.  One of the main reasons I feel so fuckin dumb. I really admire great talkers ALL THE TIME! And it‚Äôs a lot of normal words too. Nothing crazy. I just stop.... sometimes I can manage to find a way to explain the word I‚Äôm trying to think of, but sometimes I can‚Äôt really get any words out.

It makes me seem and feel so uneducation and, well, stupid. It‚Äôs embarrassing in a professional setting especially. :( I definitely struggle with this because i‚Äôm a perfectionist. I‚Äôll spend way too long trying to find a specific word, but i feel like if i don‚Äôt use that word i will have the wrong connotation to what i‚Äôm saying. I can‚Äôt stand when people add extra syllables or sounds to words that are clearly written either. Sometimes I just speak gibberish until I take a deep breath and rephrase.  BUT, at one time I knew ALL of that info plus way more than the other person and will remember it all again vividly with the simplest reminders. I can go from sounding  like an ignorant poser about a band or particular music scene to eventually running circles around anyone in the conversation with the floodgates of memories that eventually open up. But ask me a specific question and demand I answer it on the spot with no 'warm up', shit, I could seem like I forgot my own name. I usually can‚Äôt name any lyrics from a song until it starts playing. My head is filled with rap lyrics, but usually I can‚Äôt tell you what I ate yesterday. I hate the lyrics one so much. There's always music in my head but i cant sing to it... and every friend I've had seems to love singing but i can never join in.

I'm also never able to play my own music at gatherings, and for ages assumed it's because my musical tastes are too weird. But recently realised that i just can't ever think of songs that fit the current situation. Like we'll be listening to nostalgic 90s stuff and the only music I can think to put on is some weird glitch/noise stuff... And then the next day I suddenly remember all the 90s stuff i like. 

Another fun one is not fully remembering what a song sounds like when you suggest it, and it doesn't fit the mood as well as you hoped. 

 This is the worst feeling for me. It's the ultimate reason I basically quit going out and gained this wonderful new social anxiety.  Yes! Me too!  I‚Äôm a singer and I have a hard time memorizing lyrics! Ughhhhhh too real! I can‚Äôt ever remember any lyrics, song names, or album titles. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even remember the artist name. I get embarrassed and avoid talking about my ‚Äúfavorite music‚Äù. I can never remember lyrics unless the song is playing. We can mod it together... I'll be there whenever you guys make it! Me too. Sometimes when I know I‚Äôm lost, I just won‚Äôt say anything until I have caught up.  Sometimes I can catch up and sometimes I can‚Äôt.  So I am the ‚Äúquiet‚Äù one. This kills me being friends with a lot of nerdy people. Everyone can just fall into an in depth conversation about a game or movie they watched years ago, making quotes and references. I couldn't tell you what happened in the film I watched last night.

I think it makes it harder to return to things as well. I'll literally just forget what I enjoyed about a game/book/tv show and be unable to motivate myself to return to it.  My friend is having me watch this TV show and I‚Äôm like 20 something episodes in and they makes references to it all the time (JoJo blizzard adventures) but i have to fake it till I make it and pretend I know the references even though I watch the show. I don‚Äôt remember most characters names either but I remember the plot at least. Thanks, I appreciate that. I‚Äôm still relatively new to this and being able to share with people who get it is one of the most helpful things. I work at a school and get switch around to different classes, I tell every kid I meet that I am horrible at names. I'm upfront and tell them that I will need them to just tell me their name just about every time they see me. I've turned it into a game with the kindergartners I work with, they'll run up to me and ask "hey do you remember my name?" And I'll start by saying "oh of course I remember your name, silly! It's Bob!" And they laugh and pretend to be offended and I keep guessing silly off the wall names until I actually remember it or they get bored and tell me, or another kid butts in and tells me. 

If I do have to ask their name again I make sure to tell them that I remember them and I'll know their faces for a long time, and I'll say their names just repeatedly, going around the room over and over until it sticks. I've got about 3 classrooms of kid's names remembered and I work with 6 different classes, just not regularly, but it's still an every day problem of not knowing some kid's name. I just finished Thom Hartmann's book on Adult ADHD. He suggested using ridiculous images to help tag a memory as important. Maybe you could try this with names? Try to imagine a celebrity with the same name as the person you've met and then imagine them in a ridiculous outfit or pole-vaulting over a bed of crocodiles or something similar?  As accurate as your description is, I'm not sure it helps much in the real world. When you tell someone you have an impulse control disorder, they may very well brand you as dangerous. [deleted] Best. Description. Ever. >The best way I've figured out to describe it is that everyone has a little CEO in their brain running the show. Most people have a CEO that is fairly competent at doing his job. People with ADHD have the infrastructure, business model, products, etc... but they hired an incompetent jackass to run the show and he's tanking the company. Our CEO can't handle his job on a normal day meanwhile most days the office is on fire and someone's trying to kill him.

Reminds me of Billy Abbott on Young and the Restless. Also associated are memory problems as described by op as well as problems with working memory. Added to that are issues in time perception. I find they best way to illuminate others is to explain more of the symptoms using more words. I agree adhd is  poorly named because it fails to capture all the deficiencies. > The best way I've figured out to describe it is that everyone has a little CEO in their brain running the show.

ADHD is PHBD ([Pointy-Haired Boss](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiqpsjZ8aHeAhXC6YMKHUhwCH8QjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPointy-haired_Boss&psig=AOvVaw11c_DCZKFW7t1EKdMbxluR&ust=1540567070734822) Disorder).

I **love** your description! ME TOO. On the plus side my note-taking has become impeccably detailed but I'm sick of responding to my boss with "I don't remember" I've used phrases like the following a lot: "I don't recall where I read that but I know it was somewhere legitimate" or "I don't know why I know that, but I do know it's true". Many times, it's in some scenario where it comes in handy immediately and they can see that for whatever reason, I was right, but definitely not always, it'd be nice if it was! Had a lot of trouble on a recent midterm because I'm the same way.

People complain that multiple-choice tests are just memorization. They're not. *Short-answer* questions are the ultimate memorization question type, because you must have both the connection (all you need for multiple-choice) *and the term/definition/whatever* memorized.

Worse is when short-response type questions are given like they're essay questions. There's not 3-4 paragraphs to write about the three hillslope processes, or whatever. There's 3 terms and their definitions, maybe some examples. That's it. Not essay-worthy. This is me. I can pass just about any multiple choice test but make me fill in the blank with no word banks or write an essay answer? Horrible. Usually with really round-about answers that would've been much simpler had I remembered a certain word. I agree, but I tend to be bad at MCQs just because in that hurry I always misread the questions and get myself confused.  I think that's normal though Ha! There's been numerous occasions where I ask my SO about something, she looks at me with incredulous eyes and an "I already told you!". But even that it's not always a trigger enough for me to actually remember what was said, and it's only after she repeats I'm like "Ah yes I knew that".  Well as someone with a similar mother and childhood friend, it discouraged me from sharing anything with them because they'll just say they already knew it.  [Oh, Homie.](https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/Injc6336/marge-say-oh-homie/0)  Thankfully my chairs are understanding and we worked it out that I'll have take home written for the bulk of my dissertation prelims. The uni still requires an oral but the written will be weighted in their consideration. Hopefully I can do the same for the defense, I looked like an idiot at my thesis oral.  A THOUSAND YES! This is my life, all day everyday. It's like, I know the damn thing is in there, but I'll be darned if it's hiding from me. 

For some people, though, I will literally call in the middle of the night and be like, "That word I was thinking of, it was (insert)! See, I knew I knew it!"

(Maybe this is why I don't have many friends) To paraphrase from Dr. Barkley, "ADHD isn't disorder of not knowing what to do, it's a disorder of not doing what you know." You‚Äôve described me so well. Like, I can often come up with the large dictionary word for many things easier than I can the everyday word. I also get stuck in the middle of conversations because I completely forgot what I was going to say or a word eludes me. What works for me a lot is thinking through what I want to say before I start saying it. Doesn‚Äôt always work, but often.  Damn, yes, that's what took me so long to get mine checked too. Kept putting it off, and putting it off. Thanks, I‚Äôll give it a look. This is good to remember, thanks! The best convos are the chaos convos I often remember what letter the name or word starts with. Drives me nuts, though. "Oh, that was in that movie, with that actor who was on the show with the actress I also can't remember. What's the man's name, dammit? Starts with an A." Someone will say a line from a movie wrong and I'll correct them because I never make that kind of mistake, but I can't recall any names. Then I text everyone later in the day when I figure it out. Lol oh I do that a lot too, so frustrating, like "do you have any uh, tape, but not clear tape.. um, it's the opaque, kinda tan... not duct tape.. I cannot think of what it's called off the top of my head (other person is looking at you like you're an idiot) the uh .. oh! Masking tape! Yea that stuff! Do you have any I can use?".. which may or may not be an actual conversation I have had with a coworker.. I use this, but I forget I have notes and never use them when it's relevant. OMG YES. THIS IS THE WORST. OMG this always happens to me, I have to pretend I remember people when I think I've never seen them before. Sometimes I come off as rude when I'm unable to pretend, they think I'm faking my shitty memory in order to evade them. I‚Äôve only had two concussions, but I have wondered what the affect has been like too! Noggin for adhd and crashing. One heck of a combo! Maybe asked to be referred to a specialist, or do a test online and if it comes back saying you likely have ADHD tell them that or try getting a new doctor.

A lot of people don‚Äôt seem to be well informed about ADHD. #### [Solution to Chaos in 2018](https://youtu.be/7tnCVI94kQ0)

Description: How to find inner peace in 2018. Your world can became very chaotic if you don't learn mindfulness. The best solution is to sit down and listen to you...

^(Beep Boop. I'm a bot! This content was auto-generated to provide Youtube details. Respond 'delete' to delete this.) ^(|) [^(Opt Out)](http://np.reddit.com/r/YTubeInfoBot/wiki/index) ^(|) [^(More Info)](http://np.reddit.com/r/YTubeInfoBot/) But they could seriously make some arrests if I could just get it out and take down some really bad international gang. Ahhh god interviews.  Having this happen during a job interview and not knowing AT ALL and having blank brain is hideous.  I‚Äôm like, I have a master‚Äôs in English, I can speak for crap‚Äôs sake.  Just let me go do a lap outside, I‚Äôll come back in and be able to articulate what I want to.  Lol.  Fuck. I hate the arguement thing. Also makes gaslighting *that much fucking harder* to identify, and my family is notorious for it. Fuck being put on the spot. Oh my god, this is one of my biggest ADHD pet peeves. This is why the idea of socializing makes me want to hide in a hole. It's part of the reason why I suffer from social anxiety. 

I make an effort to remind everyone to *text* me instead of call, too. I can't even remember the last time I had a phone conversation with someone, other than my boyfriend. I had to cut off a friendship with a girl who'd call me whenever she wanted to talk or hang out. I felt so horrible for it, but she never got the hint when I didn't pick up and kept blowing up my phone. 

As for the argument part, I hate that too. More than anything. When my bf and I argue, I can never bring up any crucial points or back myself up. It really affects my relationship and leaves me completely vulnerable to gaslighting. I really feel for fellow ADHDers who have these problems because it can kill your self-esteem.  Wow, I thought I was the only one with the name "jumble" thing. I'm also a namejumbler. Also, this turns me into one of those people who says "I can never remember names", which isn't quite true... because I *maybe* can recall the name right, but also if I feel any doubt I know there's a good risk it will be close but wrong. *Which can be awkward*.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I think memory recall heavily relates to your current state of mind. Maybe it's negatively influenced by anxiety, even though sometimes positively influenced by stress? I'm thinking of times that were fun and relaxing even though they stressed me (pub quiz, parties, job interviews, exams) compared to others where I felt out-of-place and not able to get into to the groove of things (networking, job interviews, exams). The more enjoyment I get from taking a shot, the more I'm likely to guess an answer based on instinct and fuzzy recall, and be surprised that it's right. I JUST REMEMBERED an unimportant actors name that I refused to google for 4 months based on the fact I knew it would hit me randomly, and not so randomly, it hit me.. as I was reading this amazingly relatable thread about not remembering names and the all too real (and more important that this in particular) struggle(s)!!! That can be really frustrating can't it? I feel really annoyed with myself when that happens, and often embarrassed, but sometimes it's also not quite fair. 

&#x200B;

Like with French cinema... you can really enjoy watching it, and end up being so engrossed with the actual moving story that the surrounding details aren't really absorbed. Appreciation doesn't have to mean familiarity.

&#x200B;

At the movies I enjoy sitting till the very end, just to watch the credits (even if I know there's no bonus scene) and read about who did what. None of it sinks in, I'm still thinking about the film. Pretty much the only one, yeah. I could watch Memento twenty times new each time haha Man that has to be sadly frustrating, I'm sorry. You can almost feel it going to a different part of your brain, right. It can seem like you can still hear the music, in an emotional sense, just not what it sounds like? My father actually grew quite resentful of me for the same thing. The fishing and camping trips that were precious father son bonding times, wind up just being black periods in my memory. He takes it personally, assuming they didn't matter to me, even though I remember *other* trips and *moments* from the memories. My brain just doesn't work like that!

I know that, to this day, that's a huge part of why we don't have a good relationship. ‚ÄòWhat happened....‚Äô hahahahahaha This is valuable to me. This is the reason why I dont like phone calls or business meeting with partners! Thanks! In the future; I will tell people aill get back to them if a questions catches me off guard. Thanks!!! Ohhhh I used to!! Still do sometimes. But yeah, I've learned to give myself the time to get an answer instead of faking my way through. It got me into a lot of trouble with my boss on more than one occasion... I'd answer something just to get him to go away only to realize after that I was wrong and then have to go tell him that, meanwhile he's made a decision based on what I told him, or told someone else... Big mess. I finally admitted to him that I have trouble answering questions on the spot and that if I say I need a minute I truly need a minute. He has gotten better at not putting me on the spot and I have gotten better at responding to questions with "let me get back to you on that" or "not sure off the top of my head. I'll let you know." Etc.  Wow. Reading these comments, and especially yours, is kind of a lightbulb moment. A while ago a friend of mine actually noted that I always stop for a second and go ‚ÄúUh...‚Äù before responding or answering any question at all. I‚Äôve always felt immense difficulty with language. I think I actually write well, it just takes forever to put the words together. This also takes a huge toll on my social skills. I wasn‚Äôt sure if or how this would be connected to ADHD, but it‚Äôs starting to make sense, with all the working memory impairment and whatnot.  >I now have a rule that I won't make a decision before I've had time alone to think about it.

This is extremely good advice. Honestly? Just being aware of it so you can compensate in other ways. Haha truth...  My husband is a walking thesaurus so we make a good team, especially when I would be working on a paper for whatever class. "Hey what's the word that's kinda like this and that, but more like this and that?" Sometimes I'll have to say the sentence I'm typing also and he almost always is able to come up with the word for me, it's pretty impressive sometimes! This is a daily occurrence for me...and so damn frustrating.  I get hung up on trying to find the missing word, and the topic is derailed.

I do feel sympathy for people speaking with me...especially if they were hoping for a quick, concise conversation! >will remember it all again vividly with the simplest reminders

It feels like being a website with broken links. The pages they link to still exists, but it takes outside action to get to them. I have briefly  forgotten my name on a stressful phone call. You end up looking like the worst scammer when a phone line asks your name and you‚Äôre like ‚Äúummmm... let me check‚Äù Yess, I feel this! Right there with you!  You have to find people who understand you! They‚Äôre out there! The Golden Triad! Lemme help you guys!!  I'm the opposite! I rewatch and reread stuff over and over again because every single time feels fresh and new. Did I just read that book last month? Yup. Do I remember how it ends? Nope! MUCH SUSPENSE! Plus, as I reread or rewatch, I slowly start to remember things while also noticing new details that I missed the last time around, so each time feels like I understand the story in more and more depth.

But, man, if I stop halfway through, and it wasn't good enough to make me obsessively think about it until I finish? I will never ever return to it EVER. It no longer exists. Good job fam!  I've got aphantasia so that won't work for me  Agreed. And it doesn't explain the confusion, forgetfulness, inability to focus, etc. 

But I agree with OP that the name needs a change. Say it's an *executive function* disorder, which it is (poor impulse control is a symptom of the deficient executive function), and it works much better. I mean, I feel like a danger to myself some days, so there's that. But that's about it.  That's ludicrous. That's like someone saying they suffer from depression and everyone instantly jumps to suicide risk. If that really were true then alchohol would have been banned a long time ago instead of being freely available. I've literally told professors before that giving an exam with no note sheet accomplishes nothing beyond penalizing students with poor recall ability. Actually got a few to cave and allow notes that way.

Although one time I did that, and for some reason the professor's solution was to amend the disability testing contracts to allow full notes. As in, he gave all disabled students, *regardless of disability type*, permission to use as many pages of notes as we wanted, while the rest of the class got nothing. It was the most utterly diabolical shit. On the one hand, what the holy fuck levels of discrimination, but on the other hand, how could I possibly justify the act of cutting myself and all the other disability students off from a badly-needed resource (his exams were impossible) by complaining? 

I ended up not saying anything and neither did any of the dozen other students affected. (Not even the students with pure physical disabilities, who were justifiably extremely offended.) Everyone I spoke to about it felt dirty and wrong but a high grade in that class is such a huge bonus for grad school none of us could bring ourselves to complain. That's why you reread the questions... Yeah, me neither Not if you didn't read the textbook That happens a lot to me, and I get defensive. But the worst thing to do is try to pull that on my SO - tell her she forgot I told her something. She goes ballistic, so I just try to let it go. Oh yeah I remember lines from movies PERFECTLY. Sometimes the whole script if I loved it enough!

Another thing I have is that random lyrics will pop up in my head that relate to the action I'm doing. Like for example, when I wake up in the morning and switch on the bathroom light I'll hear **~Put On the Red Light~** in Roxanne by Sting.

Or If I finished up a shift in work and leave through the door I'll hear **~Welcome To The End of Era's, Ice Is Melting Back to Life~** by Panic at the disco.

I hear lyrics constantly.. is anyone else like that? Same with todo lists, really. Use a reminders app instead so you get notifications. It‚Äôs still too easy to ignore the notifications, but at least it solves the memory problem.

I use Due on iOS. It helps my ADHD a lot because you can set it up to remind you every 1‚Äì60 minutes (your choice, per task) until you mark it complete or change the due date. Normal reminders weren‚Äôt working as well for me because if I didn‚Äôt act on them immediately, I‚Äôd forget about the notification.

I have every new task default to a 15-minute ‚Äúnag‚Äù interval and constantly put stuff in the app throughout the day. A lot of it is extremely simple stuff, like to ask my wife a question I thought up while at work or to get lunch at the company cafeteria because I saw it was sushi day when I refilled my cup. Please please if you are an adhd specialist help me. Motherfucking exams. For some godforsaken reason my brain likes to go, "hey, y'know what would be fun, let's forget basic calculus for roughly as long as you've got for this midterm." I'm a damn physics major, there is absolutely no excuse for me to forget how to take a partial derivative, and yet sometimes I'll be sitting there genuinely trying to figure out what the curvy d symbol means.

There's also my brain's other favorite game of, "hey, you know that formula you've used a thousand times and know by heart, what if you remembered it backwards". I'm like, no brain, I will write it down and prove that I remember it the right way around. Then I'll be staring at what I wrote and my brain is like, "but are you sure it isn't backwards"... fuck. I can't tell. So I waste 15 minutes of my exam time re-deriving the stupid formula to double check and then my brain will be all, "but are you sure this is how math works" and I'm like no oh my god help I don't know what anything even is anymore.

I'm trying to figure out what diagnostic testing I need to do to get the school disability office to approve a memory cue sheet with just formulas and basic math rules on it. They denied my initial request on the basis that my ADHD report doesn't explicitly mention memory problems. Yeah on a telephone interview I was asked what .csv stood for and my million years of using them didn't help because I'd been asked directly.. but when I put the phone down obviously I recalled immediately. Didn't get the job. I‚Äôm was like this when I got diagnosed and didn‚Äôt remember a lot of things I wanted to talk about.  THIS. Ohmygosh this is both the how and the why my last relationship ended.  I've gotten into arguments with a coworker, and he usually thinks he's right and it'll go his way simply because my brain can't recall or come up with the reason I know I have.

I have a meeting later today where I'm supposed to talk about our processes which this coworker has barged in on with my work, and I just know I'm going to feel shitty at the end of it all. UGGHHH That shit drives me insane. It's the first step toward an immediate downward spiral into hypersensitive-emotional-overload-hell and THEN I look insane, on top of looking like a bad liar.  


So many times I've had to remind my very logical/literal boyfriend... like if I bring up a habit of his that bothers me, and he wants to know the last time it happened -- BRO I DONT KEEP TALLY OF WHEN AND HOW THE THING HAPPENS, I CAN BARELY RECALL WHAT I WAS THINKING BEFORE THIS THOUGHT.   
My point is, "the thing" happens; it happens often enough that I actually REMEMBER taking a mental note to ask you to stop doing it.   


/Unwarranted Venting I totally hear the social anxiety thing‚ÄîI think I developed a pseudo-coping mechanism where I half-listen (because I guess I can‚Äôt fully listen), half-make jokes, and I come off as pleasant company. Not saying that that would work for everyone but it might be a tactic to at least surviving without coming off rude, which happens, I know. I also find weirdly that looking to make jokes forces me to actively listen more so I can pick up on something to joke about. Which actually sounds like a smart tactic of how to listen well WITHOUT the goal of making jokes, but what are ya gonna do. For me The Usual Suspects. Sometimes it's fun to know it's a great film, with a great twist coming up, and be happy to go along with that.  Exactly, I remember most memories as emotions and not the events that transpired.  Talk to him about it, kindly. You mean a lot to him You're welcome! It only took me 58 years to figure it out! This happens to me too!  I can do my job well.  I can take information in at any point  but answering questions on the spur of the moment is not my thing.  I'm glad you mentioned this because I know me work, I just can't answer that way. It makes me look like a dummy, or as if I'm pretending to be one. I come back later and tell everyone what's what, and they wonder why the hell I acted like such a doofus before.

Reminds me of an anecdote I heard about the conductor, Seiji Ozawa. He came to a symphony rehearsal unprepared, having never seen the score before. The musicians became alarmed at his mistakes, and feared the performance would be ruined. Ozawa took the score back to his hotel that afternoon, and conducted it perfectly *from memory* that evening. Not sure if this is true, but it's certainly believable from my experience. Damn. Ok. I pretty much just write everything down right now in case I blank. I usually am is what's disturbing to me. Like I said, it's just weird, the word is there and then suddenly it's gone and I can't get past trying to find it again instead of just using a similar enough word.  The phrase I tend to use is "_____ isn't the right word, but it's the first to come to mind."


I think I picked it up from a book, but I'm not 100% sure which one. For some reason my brain is telling me it's from Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk? Shit! Gonna reset the router again anyway. Stressful calls are the worst for that shit! For me it's usually me or a family member's birthday. Or a security question.

That or answering personal questions for the first time with a stranger in a distracting setting. "So, how long you been in the area? Who do you know around here? What do you do for fun?" 

I know all the answers to these questions...somewhere deep in the recesses of my mind. But what usually comes out is "Uhhhhhh...you know, a while, people here and there, idk a lot of stuff I guess." lol R/adhdda Of course it does. It explains them a hell of a lot better than ADHD does. As a result of having difficult controlling your impulses your going to suffer from memory issues and an inability to focus. The inability to focus is a DIRECT result of problems controlling your impulses. The impulses are what's distracting you. While I don't disagree with you on a semantic level the reason why you can't say it's an executive function disorder is because there already is an executive function disorder. One of the main issues with ADHD is it's basically a gateway mental disorder. A lot of people are misdiagnosed either as having it when they don't or even more common having something else when in reality they have ADHD. There are a lot of overlaps between the symptoms of ADHD and other disorders. Executive Function Disorder is one of those with overlapping symptoms with ADHD but it is at the end of the day an entirely separate disorder. 

That's the reason when I make that statement I say to label it an Impulse Control Disorder. It's not perfect, there generally are very few things that are, but it's a hell of a lot more effective than ADHD which tells people fuck all. The issue with ADHD is that the deficient executive function is itself a symptom of how our brains develop/function rather than the actual root cause. ADHD is at the end of the day a developmental disorder, that's why most people's symptoms normalize/minimize as they age and their brains continue to develop.  So, you sure people don't get triggered for suicide risk when people hear about depression? I think they probably instantly do, but don't speak their thoughts just to be careful around the person who *might* be actually contemplating suicide. 
But who am I to say, I can't speak for other people. I haven't actually given any exams yet, but I've known since undergrad that I will be copying my favorite professors' trick. "You can use whatever you like. If you don't know what to look for, you won't be able to find it even with the entire Internet at your disposal." Of course, the exam questions need to be built a specific way for that to be feasible, but I like this structure much more in general. [deleted] THIS HAPPENS TO ME EVERYDAY ALL THE TIME

I thought it was just me!!! It‚Äôs so weird because sometimes it‚Äôs a song I haven‚Äôt heard in years... like a theme song from a kids movie or cartoon.
 Yup. And then the song is stuck in my head for half a day. I can pretty much respond with song lyrics or movie quotes to anything said to me. Only my brother knows what I'm saying when I do this, though. Hmm I may have to look into this app! This is mega important and real people are being trafficked into prostitution by these guys I've realised. God fucking damn, I hate exams for exactly this reason. It doesn't help that in my field good memory is a requirement because there's no cheat sheets when you're interviewing people. I mean, there are, they're called your interview questions, but you still have to know shit by heart. So I know comparatively more shit than most people, and have even colleagues comment on "you know so-o-o much..."

...and I'm like "I'll go cry in the corner, thanks, because I. Forget. Shit." I think the only ones who really see it in action are the tutors I pay to keep up with some stuff. When they're explaining something for the twentieth time. Go for it, man. I dropped out of my physics major half a year ago largely because I couldn‚Äôt solve the issue you describe here. The big difference was that I hadn‚Äôt been diagnosed with ADHD yet, back then.  SO MUCH THIS. Not in Uni anymore but that feeling of my brain failing to work for no fucking reason is so familiar. me irl litterally 2 weeks ago. I suddenly forgot the meanings of [x,y] vs (x,y) the night before an exam. I'm a 3rd year math student. It was just embarrassing. I got an accommodation in school to take any multiple choice quizzes/tests that involve computation as open-answer ones instead, for precisely these kinds of small errors in memory and attention. If I screw up the math a little but have the right approach, maybe I lose a point or two out of ten. If it‚Äôs multiple-choice, though, it‚Äôs all-or-nothing, so I get no credit for knowing the concepts even though I made some stupid arithmetic error.

I am very surprised that you have physics exams where you are expected to remember the formulas though. My physics exams always had a formula sheet at the beginning, for everyone. Because knowing the formulas is completely separate from understanding the concepts and being able to apply the formulas correctly.  Testing accommodations were a total game changer for me... I just kick myself it took me so long to admit my issues were severe enough to qualify. I found what made my forgetting 10000000 times worse was the time pressure and the panic surrounding just the act of not being able to remember. I really hate those trivia questions in interviews. Like, seriously, why are you evaluating job qualifications based on knowledge that anyone could look up in 2s if they needed to? Rote memory is not a particularly valuable skill in so-called ‚Äúknowledge work‚Äù. (It might be if you work a service job or manage inventory or something, but then the value is in your ability to retain information specific to the job you‚Äôre interviewing for, so testing your memory of industry trivia still doesn‚Äôt help.) There are so many other actual skills that matter so much more than recall of factual trivia under pressure.

I got into such a big argument with a coworker once because he wanted to reject a candidate on the basis that he did not know the best JSON-parsing library to use in Java, off the top of his head. Because obviously a _real_ software developer has definitely worked with JSON in their preferred/most-comfortable language, even if applications written in that language tend to prefer more structured data formats. (/s) Do you think you'd have better recall in a more relaxed situation, like if a friend casually asked while you were walking together? [deleted] s a m e You can do it man. I've got a feeling that today is going to be one of the days where all the neurons line up the right way and you're gonna be great! THIS. YES. This is what I've been trying to explain to people for years. I can't tell you WHAT happened, but I can tell you how it FELT Hopefully by posting your comment it will only be 33 for me <3 Yes! I‚Äôve figured this out too! It‚Äôs a deal I made with myself and it really helps a lot!!! I am religious about listkeeping and calendar keeping.  I am too but only when I don't need it, I'm basically the exact same, almost hyperfocusing on the lack of that word instead of being able to just continue the story, and the exasperated looks on the other person's face is a nice addition too :/ if nothing else, at least know you're not alone with the issues even though I know it feels that way often. I like that, I'll have to use it, if I remember it lol .. is that book good? /r/Devil'sTriangle ?

 I think being more specific about what impulses are is what's missing. The impulses aren't just behaviors, ie I start working on different tasks before completing others, it's your mind running away from you to think about other things. It doesn't always manifest as a behavior. Well, I rather tell people I have ADHD than having to tell them I have an impulse control problem.. ADHD doesn't give it a fair name either, imo, but it's less bad, albeit less descriptive. If you instantly jump to "suicide risk" when you hear the word "depression" you need to go read up a lot more about what depression actually consists of and as someone who I assume suffers from ADHD you should know way better than to trivialize and make extreme judgements on people based on them mentioning their mental illness/disorder. 

I don't know a single person that if they hear someone is depressed they instantly assume that person is at risk of suicide.  I scraped through an Engineering diploma and one of the modules was on Refrigeration. 

They expected us to memorise the formulas.

Even with formula sheets, I still struggled. The only reason I actually passed the whole thing was because they let us do a Math exam in the first year with our own A4 page of notes. 

I did a past paper in really small writing and the worked examples helped me ace the test. The board basically exempted me on a couple of failed modules because of that. >What the fuck do they mean disorder? ADHD is only a problem as long as we are compared to baseline performance in I system built around our biggest negative qualities. For instance the school system built around remembering information by heart to pass exams.

That's pretty much the definition of disorder Thats awesome I thought it was just me!

It's funny I quite like that aspect of ADHD, I suppose its my minds way of making ordinary things a little bit more interesting. Diagnosis doesn‚Äôt seem to make a difference. Now that I‚Äôm aware of it, it makes it more frustrating because it‚Äôs not something that gets better with time or work.  Yes. Well, that did not happen yesterday. Today! Though, it did. X3 I think it's a pretty good book, but it has been a number of years since I read it. It's strange and macabre, but so are all of Palahniuk's books (for some context, he's the one who wrote Fight Club). Invisible Monsters is a book about identity and being undesirable in a culture where appearance is idolized. Man, I should really get it in audiobook format and experience it again. Except that you aren't MISSING any impulses. Impulse isn't a behaviour lol. You're not talking about the same thing, you're talking about something entirely different. 

It is an inability to control your impulses. Impulses manifest in all kinds of different ways ranging from susceptibility to addiction/risky behaviour, over spending, inability to focus, irratibility, etc... It's different from person to person. There is absolutely no need to increase specificity because it is utterly impossible to be specific about someones inability to control their impulses other than the fact that they have problems controlling their impulses.  What is "less bad"? I mean I get that you would rather do that because you want to minimize the potential issues regarding how you're perceived and there is a stigma with mental illness and mental disorders. But can't have your cake and eat it too. People can't complain about not being taken seriously when they say they ADHD and the symptoms being trivialized when those who are trivializing it do not understand what the actual problem is. 

ADHD is a child's illness/joke illness because no one talks about the actual severity of it or the severity of it's impact. Just like with everything there is a range in how people are hit by it. Some people with depression manage it easily without medication, and some people with depression need to be on suicide watch, but we have gotten to a point where depression is for the most part understood as a serious issue that shouldn't be trivialized by people saying "oh it's been such a hard week, I'm so depressed" when in reality they're just sad. Meanwhile how many people walk around going "oh man I have such bad ADD right now" or use our meds recreationally.  I actually like it too, and I agree with that description. I also feel it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a musical number on Broadway when really I‚Äôm just catching a train or walking into a room, hahaha. It definitely makes me laugh at what random songs my brain decided to store  Ah, I meant the difference between OP‚Äôs situation and mine back then. I didn‚Äôt consider asking for that kind of help since I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed. And I think that that kind of help can certainly make a difference in dropping out or not. 

Just knowing that I have ADHD didn‚Äôt change all that much for me, so in that regard I agree with you. But external help certainly makes life easier and you more successful.  This. So much this. 

Before I was diagnosed I was always looking for that next thing that, if I was just super disciplined, would finally see me able to function like my peers. There was more motivation to seek out a solution. 

After 47 years it is quite clear it isn‚Äôt  coming, 
so, even with medication, I know now that it will never stop or get better, I just have to learn to manage and treat it.  Ah good to know. Thank you for the info! I'm currently reading/listening to The Stand by Steven King, I'm about a third of the way through it and I like it a lot so far. I have it in book format and on audiobook, so I can do either depending on my attention/mood at the moment! Oh yeah I wish life was like a musical, like that musical episode from Scrubs lol (If you ever seen it) For a more recent book recommendation, I highly suggest the book Turtles All The Way Down by John Green. It has an amazingly real perspective on anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and living with mental illness, which is way more relevant to this subreddit in general. I have not seen it but you can bet I‚Äôll be adding it to my very long list :)  If you're anything like me you'll love it!
