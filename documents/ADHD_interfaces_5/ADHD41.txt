I have an ADHD friend that can do freaking anything. I, in comparison, have very few notable talents to speak of. Where does he get his motivation and love for learning from? Are there benefits to ADHD that I'm somehow not aware of? How can I use this disorder to my advantage? **I have a friend who's ADHD, and he can do freaking *everything*.** He can compose a song, then sing, perform, mix, and master it by himself. He can throw a party/rave/convention, draw artwork for posters, handle VIPs, promote it, then balance the books. He can cook, shop for homes, turn a wire coat hanger into any kitchen utensil you need, and kill someone with his pinky finger. He's charismatic, charming, well-traveled, and friends with everyone. **He always seems so motivated, inspired, and intensely driven to just do *everything*, and masterfully to boot.**

**I'm ADHD and I'm nothing like that**. **I'm forgetful, clumsy, scatterbrained and lazy.** I *love* to help out with parties and projects, but end up finishing things late or making too many humiliating mistakes to be considered reliable. I can't play any instruments worth a damn. I space out in class and struggled miserably through school. I'm not athletic or fit. I always worry that my work is imperfect and struggle to submit it (I spent an hour on this post and another hour revising details). My imagination is pathetic and I lack artistic creativity. **Meds really help with the motivation but wear off before I can get anything done and don't do anything for my scatterbrain.**

The only things I can really claim to be *really* good at are video games (which now utterly *bore* me), film editing (takes me *forever* to do), setting up home theaters (ditto), critical logic ('cause the last thing we need is more critics...), and learning new computer interfaces (Mac! PC! Win8! iPhone! WOO!). A few things I'm *kinda* good at but can't seem to get better at are graphic design (I can *assemble* but I can't *create*), motion graphics (ditto), web design (...ditto), and audio production.

**Basically, I can't be assed to be good at anything beyond my computer, and even then my talents are limited.  Is this just an introvert/extrovert thing? Am I doing something wrong? Is there a secret to ADHD that I haven't unlocked or properly taken advantage of? Or does this ability to acquire a billion talents only manifest itself in a few ADHD people?** [deleted] Firstly, I doubt your friend has ADHD.
Secondly, your ADHD may be just more severe, while his is a mild one 1) If you are like most people, as you go through life one day meet someone who just seems *better* than you, on almost every dimension. That's *okay*. It's not a competition. On the other hand, it's good to look at people who are doing better than you in order to get what they have.

2) Doing things with ADHD *well* means doing things you are intrinsically interested in. Otherwise, you'll be wrestling your attention the entire time. Besides, why would you even *want* to do something you aren't interested in, unless you absolutely have to?

3) Yes, ADHD is correlated with *some* advantages with idea generation and creativity...but correlations found by scientists in the lab who are studying college student populations don't always translate to the real world. 

4) By reading your post, ADHD is probably *not* the main thing that's blocking you from being successful. it's probably *neuroticism* - the tendency to experience negative emotions like self doubt, anxiety, and low self esteem. Negative emotions are toxic to creativity. For example, why did you care so much that the post be perfect that you spend to hours on it? Did the possibility that random anonymous people on the internet would think you write poorly cause you anxiety?

5) Amateur film editor, a smattering of computer skills, and the ability to write coherent paragraphs is way more talents than most people have. Count your blessings.

When you want to do hard things, try your best to make your internal self-critic to *shut up* and just do it one small accomplishment at a time. 

When you *don't want* to do hard things and would rather just be "lazy" and take it easy...then take it easy and have fun. It's okay. There's no reason to feel *guilty* for not being productive. As long as you are able to support yourself, there is no rule that says you *have* to have a ton of externally verifiable accomplishments. Live life for yourself, on your own terms.

6) 

>kill someone with his pinky finger. 

So, you're either referring to sheer strength on his part, or martial arts ability. Either way, exercise tends to influence personality traits in a positive way.

Are you suffering from sedentism? That might be part of the reason for the difference.  I think "talent" is relative and that in terms of ADHD, if you are an individual that can recognize the subtle distinctions that give things concepts or ideas charm (kind of how I'd describe myself) then you can appear "gifted" but still make mistakes  

I can and have done do a lot of things despite my ADHD. 

Here' I'll list:

* I can draw (and was in gifted art for a number of years). 

* In my spare time I create scales and progressions on the piano/keyboard (after 12 years of practice)

* I play flight simulator (and I like to think some of those skills are portable to real world situations)

* I was a boy scout with avid camping and outdoors experience.

* I've traveled to many of the continental states and Hawaii, and a few locations in the caribbean. 

* I had the opportunity to swim in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and enjoy swimming.

* I successfully completed a competitive bike race. 

* Toured the summit of an inactive Hawaiian Volcano 

* I've been snorkeling and completed deep sea dive training. 

* I climbed a waterfall in Jamaica. 

* I was on my high school's debate team and advanced to the elimination rounds at national tournaments across the country. 

* I just started taking up writing, and am working on a couple of short stories. 

* CPR certified 

* I have two majors in college (but seriously, lets not talk about school) 

* I worked on a presidential campaign in the national office.



This list here, it may be impressive to some, but personally many of these things are "just qualifying" affairs. I haven't turned any of that piano stuff into an actual piece of music, for example. Most of the vacation stuff was planned and involved my following directions. In Boy Scouts we did a lot of activities as a group. Why would I do a "complete flight" on flight simulator anyway? There's more blank canvass than there is actual drawing if you look. I have yet to finish a short story. My debate history makes for some funny stories, but isn't anything remarkable. I ventured into many of these things when I figured I was no good at the previous one. The presidential campaign was fun, but then it ended. Don't ask me about school. I want to do things, I really do, but I bet if your friend truly has ADHD then he's in a situation similar to mine, with many of my friends still impressed by whatever the list above is despite the fact that I struggle to achieve a 3.0, lose sleep, interest, and the desire to continue the things truly worth further effort. I don't even know how to site read sheet music. I was just diagnosed this november, with mild depression as well. I'm going to see where this year takes me. He gets his. Motivation from Adderal wow you just described me in so many ways its not eeeeeeeeeeeven funny.  well if you want a friend I am here /u/randaperry Or, as mentioned previously, the friend is C and OP is PI.
