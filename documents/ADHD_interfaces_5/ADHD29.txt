Here is a list of tablet apps that can help us ADDers with life, the universe, and everything I originally wrote this post as a response to someone else's thread and someone suggested that I make it its own thing. This is geared towards students in particular, but most of the things are helpful to me currently and I have been out of college for 8 years.   Here it is!  


* **TimeTimer app** - visual timer with a shrinking pie/clock face. Really helps to be able to truly SEE and understand how much time is left. Has a gentle "time's up!" alarm. I use this every day of my life.  

* **30/30 app** - kind of similar to above, but helps keep you on track for routines, like getting ready in the morning. Beeps when you should be changing activities, and has a shrinking clock segment for each.  Very customizable and pretty.  Good for pomodoros.    

* **Standard clock app** - for lots of different alarms. I have alarms for waking up and taking my medication (after which I go to sleep), actually waking up 10 minutes before I have to leave the house, tea time, starting homework time, setting up for going to sleep, etc. Also, Can be used to announce the time via beeps, vibration or (as I do) actually saying the time out loud every hour.  Game changer for me.   

*  **Buddhify** - for beginning guided meditation. Has several different tracks, including an attention/focus training one, one for waking up, going to sleep, etc.   

* **F.lux** If you have a jailbroken iPad or an android tablet  helps to dim/color the screen depending on time of day so that going to bed at night is easier  

* **Find my phone** (if it is an iPad) for when he leaves it someplace - helps you to find it more readily, and him, too!  Otherwise, get a Tile and slap it on there.  

* **quizlet** - awesome flashcard app. Great for vocabulary, languages, facts, etc. Has many standard classes' material already input. Cannot recommend enough.  My kid uses this every day.  

* **Khan Academy app** -  This is great for any content - especially math and science he isn't quite picking up from school and/or texts. Gamifies learning bit.  Another one my kid uses constantly.  

*  **Remind/Edmodo** if your/kid's teachers use them.  

*  **Trello, Any.do, Clear or Wunderlist **- a lot of people on here swear by these. I don't use them because a paper to do list works better for me. When I did use one, I did **Omnifocus** - but it has a big learning curve and is focused on the GTD methodology even though it is excellent.  

* **Google docs or dropbox** - something that will allow you to quickly and easily access the homework that you forgot at home or didn't print out for one reason or another. Hey, it happens.  

* **Evernote premium.** Incredibly popular. Could be supremely useful for everyone in the world for every situation.  The premium is what really makes it.  

* **Dragon Dictation** -  could use this to transcribe lectures at school, or to transcribe papers or the like that you dictate to it rather than having to sit and type them. Helpful for those of us who can't type while we walk and yet do our best thinking on the move.   

* **Notability or Penultimate** - both handwriting apps. You can use a stylus to take notes for class or to do lists or whatever directly onto the tablet rather than in a notebook. Lots of these will covert writing directly to "typed" text and work together with google docs, dropbox, or evernote, meaning this can be used for checklists, too and reminders, and that the notes will be annotatable, shareable, searchable and available across several platforms, in addition to potentially linked up to alarms and reminders.  

* **Focus Time** - kind of like the first two apps I listed, excellent for using the pomodoro productivity method (I like 30/30 better, though this is more pomodoro specific)  

* **White Noise Pro** - many different "flavors" of white noise. You can even create your own mix. Helps to block out distractions, especially when combined with noise canceling headphones. Also helps with going to sleep.  
  
* **Recordium Pro** - will allow you to record entire classes, meetings, etc., then go back and highlight and search the important bits. You can also annotate and tag the recordings. Works with dropbox and evernote and google and iCloud and stuff.   

* **FamDoo** - I just found this one last night. It is for parents and kids but I am seriously tempted to use it myself for ME. You assign tasks for whose completion you earn points.  The points are pre-purchased and prefunded.  You can immediately and automatically redeem the points through the app with amazon, iTunes/app store, best buy and target (as well as some charitable causes).  Very very good for that immediate gratification we ADHDers need so badly.  Haven't tried it yet, though. Would be even better if you could get it to work with Steam.  

More generally:

* if you are taking a language course, an electronic translation dictionary relevant to the language  

* a good camera app so that you can take pictures of notes on the board or assignments, or flyers or street signs or.....whatevere and something like **CamScanner** that will allow you to use pictures of papers (that you have taken, that friends have sent when you/your kid has forgotten his) more efficiently, though some of the functionality overlaps with other apps I am listing  

*  **Digital copies of every single text book** he has been assigned, and review books too, as well as a robust reading app that allows him to annotate (though I think evernote will allow you to do that) - **GoodReader** is one, and there is obviously Ibooks, kindle app, google play books. Use the dictionary, search, highlighting, annotating, clipping and translation functions.    

*  an app that interfaces easily with your printer  

*  If your local library has an app, get it.   

*  A word processor and a slide show creator (like **pages, word or googledocs, and keynote or powerpoint**)   

*  A good calculator app - scientific or graphing would be even better  

*  Generous monthly data allowance  

*  Text to speech app like **Google's or Voice Dream** - will allow him to listen to those books you have downloaded, or listen to the notes he has taken in evernote, or photographed with his other apps - because sometimes it is better to be able to study by listening while doing something else, like jumping jacks or showering or jogging around the block. Google Text to speech even interfaces with the translation one so that he can get the correct pronunciation of his language class words.  

*  A very very protective case like an otter box.  

*  A good pair of small, noise canceling headphones or buds  

*  Habit building apps like Don't Break the Chain or Easy Habits.  (I don't use these. This type of thing is too much pressure for me personally, but I think it would work really well for other people).  

Whew! That's all I've got so far! I know someone wrote a post about OneNote and there was another one about Google Keep, but I do't know anything about them so I didn't put them on. Will be happy to update this list with suggestions.  Maybe we can make this type of thing a sidebar resource?   Thanks for posting this, you're one of the amazing people that put something together to help others. This is awesome! Something I like to use that's not just tablet specific is Pocket. It lets you save webpages to view later which is great for me, because it helps me avoid getting distracted by interesting articles and whatnot since I know I can just save them for later. It syncs across all your devices too! This is awesome. I use my tablet for just about everything and a bullet journal for todos, notes, lists. I feel better writing things down, plus my moleskine notebook doesn't require batteries.  I'm struggling to find 30/30.  A french climbing app shows up...

Installed time timer - answered enough surveys for it to be free! I find alarm apps good for building habits without knowing that you're doing so What's better about the premium version of Evernote?  >Digital copies of every single text book he has been assigned, and review books too, as well as a robust reading app that allows him to annotate (though I think evernote will allow you to do that) - GoodReader is one, and there is obviously Ibooks, kindle app, google play books. Use the dictionary, search, highlighting, annotating, clipping and translation functions.

This is a really good one to add into 504s and IEPs too, fyi. This year we have school-provided copies of all the textbooks and it is wonderful!  you da man! (or woman!)  I have some for android. First 'bedtime' i have a bit of a sleep problem and it helps time your sleep cycles. Check it and set your alarm, it can tell you when you should go to bed to wake up rested at your normal time, or when you should set your alarm for if you are going to bed right then. It has helped me feel much better rested when i am able to get to sleep ( insomnia, circadian rythm sleep disorder)

Next is 'screen filter' you can set the brightness anywhere between 100 and 0 % but getting much lower than 30% makes the screen rather hard to see.  It remembers the last setting so you only have to tap the symbol to turn it on or off, and you can adjust it anytime. The lowest brightness my phone goes on its own tends to hurt my eyes while reading. This helps a lot.

Last is 'cashflow' it lets you create multiple account trackers. It does not tie in with actual banking info, you have to remember to enter debits and credits to each account. I am not always good with using this one.  But if you can keep up with it you can glance quickly to check if you can actually spend that five bucks on a wanted item. I like this because it isnt tied to actual baking info, it feel safer to me not to have my info on my phone just in case. great for keeping track of multiple cards, savings, even the cash amount you have in your wallet. I keep my receipts and enter them at the end of the day. Best bonus to this is if i have a payment due and i know i cannot spend the money i subtract it from my account balance and then i do not think i have extra to spend.  Helps a lot when my atm will tell me i have 100 and i can check cashflow and see i really only have 65. 

A few more that help me keep track. 'Work shifts free' keep track of your schedule. 

'Write now' great for shopping lists. 

'Safe notes' password protected lists,  good for anything you want to keep a bit more protected like dr appointments that you may lose the reminder card for.  This is just what I've been looking for - thanks!  I used 30/30 for the first time today and it's awesome. Easy to use and exactly how I need to manage extended periods of homework. Thanks! 42? Thank you so much for posting this!  I can't wait to go through the list with my son. :) Is Dragon Dictation sensitive enough to hear my professor talk over the mic? This is an awesome list! I'm definitely going to go through it and see what I can use. 

Another one to add is Rescue Time. I just started using it and it had been eye opening. It tracks everything you do on the computer and categorizes it to tell you how productive you are.
It can also be customized and tweaked to best fit what you need. It is a very visual way to hold yourself accountable!  Thank you, so much for this. Absolutely wonderful. Sleep cycle! 

It's the best fucking alarm app,  ever. 

Basically,  you pick when to be up,  then it records when you shift around at night.  Then,  it predicts the last time you are gonna shift around before your chosen wake up time and once you start to move around,  it gently wakes you up. 

Ive never gotten up earlier feeling more refreshed In My Whole Life. 

Now ,  I have so much more time for activities!  Awesome list! Might I suggest [Pushbullet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android) to be added to it? 

It basically let's you push everything to another device. I'm not going to try and explain it more than that. .. I only have had this for about a week or two. But it really is one of the best apps I've downloaded this year! Saved.  **Simpletask** for Android is awesome and free and open source.

**Twilight** is a F.lux clone that's free (as in beer) and doesn't require root.

**Quill** is a free and open source handwritten notetaking app.

**Adobe Reader** is still the best PDF annotator I've found. Also free (as in beer). What is Trello et al?  (Also!  Thank you so much for doing this!!) Awesome list. I should print it out and put it somewhere I'll always remember it... I have one super important app.  Cortana.  She is incredible.  The geo fencing is great.  Im sure Siri and Google Now do similar stuff, but the simplicity of windows phone also really helps.  I will say "Cortana, remind me to run management reports when I get to work tomorrow". And bam, as soon as I walk in the front door, she tells me what to do.  It is then up to me to mark it as complete or tell her to remind me next time I'm at work (after lunch). It is encouraging me to become slightly more self reliant and self starting.  It also is training me to do stuff the moment I think about it (if its important.  You know, the **RIGHT** kind of impulsive). My phone has gone from being my worst enemy to my greatest ally since being promoted to management.  Seriously, I have the meds and they are great and they have facilitated being an adequate human being, but as my psych says, they are there to help you become a better organized person and develop coping strategies and improve generally.  They are not there to MAKE you that person.  That is up to me.  

This slight shift in attitude has made me happier, more successful and better organized.  At least at work anyway.  My house is still a mess. :P


/diversion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nefkrwJKpU currently using evernote free and loving it. whats the benefit of the premium?

i know i can just google this but curious why you feel it is so beneficial given the subreddit. Very useful, thanks cooooool. can attest. evernote (free ) is awesome!

I put my entire life in there, sorted by different notes. I'm on the bus and I can't remember what I was supposed to do? I just pull up the note! I also made a list of big life goals. I keep looking at them so I don't forget them!
so helpful TIL that /u/UnicornOnTheJayneCob is some kind of reddit Jedi master, because my original request post asked exactly the thing he is answering (again) here, but my post got like, no love, and here he is a superstar with all the responses and groupies and everything.  I bow to your superior mojo.  And these really are great suggestions. I thought Pocket was going to be great for me, and I used it for about two months.. but then I stopped reading things in it and it just collected more and more cruft.. Oh and got Google Keep after a post the other day.  Love it so far. I've not used it, but one of my lecturers recommended it immensely, pointing out how much time it's saved him over the years (given his PhD, and various other 30-60k word reports...).

Main thing he said though was that if/when you get it, you'd have to spend a bunch of time letting the software get used to your voice/way of speaking.

So even if it *is* able to pick up the professor, the accuracy might be off a bit. (especially if you're talking about using it in the physical class, in which case people talking around you could be an issue as well) Yes! I love RescueTime. I use it for freelance comic work as it allows me to track my hours in a program and compare them to what I'm actually being paid (since I charge page rate and not hourly, gotta make sure I'm being efficient enough to make more than minimum wage lol).

My only problem with it is that you categorize an entire website as "unproductive" or "productive", when for example I use twitter and tumblr to network, but they are *also* recreational timesinks. Idk how you'd fix that though, probably just my own problem haha Which company? I tried searching,  but there are a dozen apps with that name  How does it do with two in the bed? Is Cortana an android app? I couldn't find it in the store. Haha yeah that happens to me too, eventually I end up dedicating some time to going through everything and deleting all the things I don't need. (oddly enough, that's one thing I don't have trouble focusing on) Northcube AB.

It also has sleep aid/white noise built in if you use that.

I'm an avid user myself - can also recommend Power Nap from the same company if you're into powernaps; but be aware that Power Nap is slightly buggy, so check the "Nap up to X minutes" to make sure it lists the right number of minutes before starting it. You would put it up by your head,  next to your pillow on your side of the bed. 

There's actually a pretty good little tutorial set-up thingy that makes the app really easy to use.  Windows phone only....  Sorry. :/ Cool thank you.  I'll investigate :)
