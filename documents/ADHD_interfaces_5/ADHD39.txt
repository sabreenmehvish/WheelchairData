An awesome software I wish we had... It would be an awesome invention of sorts, to have a program or some kind of user interface that can track your behaviors and activities, and time them all live, to give you a clear sense of how much time you spend doing things.

Try 30:30 for understanding time frames to do things. 
Try Habitica for todo lists and when things are due.
