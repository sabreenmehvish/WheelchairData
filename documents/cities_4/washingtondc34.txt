PGPD seek thief who stole 4-year-old boy's wheelchair  And I get downvoted whenever I imply PG County is full of worthless criminals. The rate of violent crime in PG County is certainly shocking. It's bad enough that the decent people there have to deal with that; it would be nice to use language that distinguishes between the perpetrators, victims, and bystanders. My heart goes out to anyone who lives in fear in their own neighborhood. I am guessing that painting them all with a broad brush is what earns downvotes.
