Zach Anner (wheelchair travel show host) filming on Venice Beach  The first time I walked by, they were standing in front of muscle beach discussing if he should go in there. On the way back, he was getting basketball tips.
I'm happy he got his show, mostly because I feel like there aren't enough happy, fun, nice people on tv. Go Zach!
