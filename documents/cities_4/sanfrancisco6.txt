Feel free to message suggestions for future song/questions/etc for next week. Also, use this post to share any events you are going to you think other redditors would be interested in. If you are visiting or just moved to SF (welcome BTW) ask questions! We'll try to crowdfund you some responses. As always, please be kind. There's an older guy in a red scooter/wheelchair who scoots up and down the Market St. corridor from the financial district up through mid-Market with a speaker playing salsa/samba music in the afternoons. He's just rocking out in his chair and inviting pedestrians to rock out with him. He is awesome! :) [deleted] Anyone have any favorite spots in the Richmond I should check out? I'm moving there this weekend (been in Nob for a year and a half) and would love some recommendations! PSA the Muni shuttles through market are packed Lol I see that dude almost every day, love it. Also I've seen a band the backyard party kings playing by powell station/ the cable car turn around there pretty good for a random street party. I saw thing guy today on my way to lunch!  So quirky! I love SF! I generally love it when people jam out to their cellphones/speakers when I'm not trapped next to it, like on a bus. Someone on here posted a video of him not too long ago.
