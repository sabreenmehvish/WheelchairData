Hope to see some of you guys there. [deleted] VIA BUS SERVICE

On Monday, January 20, people wishing to attend the Martin Luther King, Jr. March can ride VIA’s mainline bus service. 

People who ride the bus to the 2014 Martin Luther King, Jr. March from the Freeman Coliseum and St. Philip’s College will get to ride for free. 

On Monday, January 20, VIA will allow all riders going to or coming from the MLK March to get on board without paying a fare as long as they get on at the Freeman Coliseum (route 24) or St. Philip’s College at Wyoming Street and South Mittman Street (route 25). When boarding, riders will need to inform the bus operator that they are going to the march in order to get the waived fare. 

Buses will take passengers to the march between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., and buses will bring them back from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The drop-off point for service to the march will be on MLK Drive west of UplandDrive. The pick-up location for return service will be at Pittman Sullivan Park.
