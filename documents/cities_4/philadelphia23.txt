Anyone have a wheelchair to lend or offer? My brother is going to orthopedic surgery today.  We all planned to go tailgate the Eagles v. Vikings game this Sunday, but it will be especially hard if he'll be in crutches.  Does anyone have a wheelchair to lend?  I may be able to help. Its not the prettiest of the bunch, but anything is better than nothing right.

Let me check with my mom, I don't recall what we did with the ones we had. She works in a nursing home as well, so she may have some resources. in a pinch...office chair and prop his foot up... Awesome man,  will reach you soon... awesome, thanks.
