Inexpensive Rehearsal Dinner Suggestions? We are trying to stay around $700 for 30-35 people. We are open to anything: private event spaces that let us byob and catering,  semi private restaurant spaces, or even nonprivate space in a quiet/not busy restaurant. as long as it's possible for us to stay within budget and is a reasonable distance from where most our guests are staying in downtown. Unfortunately, everything we've found so far either: a. aren't wheelchair accessible (requirement) b. have a high minimum c. aren't available d. expensive af.

I do not. maybe you could spend most of budget on getting a small hotel conf  room and rest of budget on ordering/catering food If having it at someone's house is an option, that might be your best bet. Most places have a high cost for renting a space and restaurants usually have a minimum for how much you have to spend on food when using their private room Maggianos, No Mas Cantina, Gordon Biersch, Ra Sushi, Hyatt House on 10th
