Temporarily disabled DC woman looking for wheelchair/scooter in order to attend Women's March Hello friends,

Does anyone in NW DC have a wheelchair or scooter I can borrow to attend the Women's March tomorrow? I have been treating a leg injury over the past two months, and my left leg is in an air cast, but unfortunately my doctor has not processed my medical paperwork with the insurance company in time for me to buy or rent wheelchair/scooter in time for the march.

Update: All the rental services I've reached out to are sold out and my calls to local hotels for spare chairs have been unsuccessful. Thanks for your support.

Thanks for reading!
