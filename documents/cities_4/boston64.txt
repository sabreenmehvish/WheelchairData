Anybody walk around Newbury/Hereford? I worked in the area up until a year or two ago. The last few months I was there, an older (homeless?) man in a wheelchair would show up every morning and sit outside the BAC.  This was in the dead of winter too.  He always had tan pants on, gloves if it was cold, and was pretty bald.

It's a long shot, but has anyone seen him in that area?  I saw the post about Tricycle Louie, and it reminded me of this guy.
