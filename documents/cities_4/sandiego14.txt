Hey /sandiego, what are some fun things to do in your city in beginning of November? I'm going to be in San Diego from November 5 to November 8th. I was there once before, but was an over night stay at the last minute and didn't have too much time to explore. What are some places I should visit or eat at? If you could recommend places that are wheelchair friendly, that would be awesome. Thanks! :) Check the right. There's a bunch of stuff in there under What to do in San Diego. Additionally, there have been dozens of similar threads here, each containing other ideas.

I don't know about wheelchair accessible though. Obviously hiking is out, but there's probably plenty of wheelchair friendly stuff downtown in the lists. I'm pretty sure most of Balboa Park is ADA compliant, if you're willing to do a lot of wheeling. It's a beautiful park.
