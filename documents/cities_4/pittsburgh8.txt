What's your tips for riding the T? Hello, I'm looking at making a move to the South Hills and need to commute to work downtown. I wanted to see if anybody had any recommendations about riding the T. I've biked, bussed and drove in the past, but never rode the light-rail system. I'll be living just far enough from the T that walking isn't ruled out, but not necessarily convenient. 
* What are the best park'n'ride options? 
* Can you park at any stops without having to pay for parking?
* Are there bike racks at any T stops? Would it be stupid to expect a bike to still be there when you get back?
* Bringing a bike on the T at rush hour - that's not done, right?
* Expect to stand during rush hour?

Sidenote: Google Maps doesn't seem to have an option for combining public transit with driving. [deleted] Mt. Lebanon T-station has bike racks. There's a ton of foot traffic at all hours so I don't foresee anything happening to a bike left there all day. Also, it's right next to the police station, if you find that comforting. Download HopStop to your mobile device.  You can take the bike anytime, but it has to go in the fold up seat area reserved for the elderly.  I think it's a better choice to ride to the station and lock up your bike.  Washington Junction, Castle Shannon, and South Hills Village are your best bets with parking, both will give you access to the RED line, while you will have to walk from Castle Shannon to the Willow stop if you want to get the BLUE line (W. Junction and SHV haVE both). Only stations have parking, but it is free (first come first serve, however, and not free at SHV). All the seats will be gone after Castle Shannon during rush hour (inbound) and if you want to bring your bike on, which you are allowed, get in the second car and stand with it in the exit that is next to where the driver usually sits. Also, I'm pretty sure there is a limit to how many bikes are allowed on it at once so there's an off chance you could be told no-go on the bike at some point, though I can't recall ever seeing that happen. It depends on what area of the South Hills you are looking at.  Anywhere from Washington Junction and closer to the city is a zone 1, which will be cheaper.  Washington Junction, Castle Shannon, Mt Lebanon and I think Dormont are all free park and rides but they tend to be full by 8am-ish.  I'm not as familiar with the blue line side, (sorry) which can be a little faster.  I didn't think they allowed bikes on the T during peak hours until my fiance just said that you must keep it in the handicap areas but that must be yielded to those in need...and unless you get on at an earlier stop on the line, you'll likely stand.  Depending on your personal preference and tolerance, the T still might be less stressful than the daily idiot drivers.

My fiance walks to the T, takes the T and bus into Oakland and after a week or so, google figured out his schedule and would give commuting and travel times each day. If you have Android use the [Transit App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetransitapp.droid&hl=en)  which is realtime in Pitt.  

Unless your in Zone 2, parking is a bitch.  You're better off ride the bike to the station and locking it up.  If you take it on the T make sure to not do it when it's packed.  

As for standing, it's not so bad.  I eventually find a seat.  Then again I'm going from Library->Oakland and back so I have all the time in the world.  You should combine this info into a wiki article as a way to give back for all the sweet info you're getting. Outbound: if you're getting off on a high level stop always ride the second car, as the first will fill up with people who have to ride first car to get off on low level stops. During commute times, if you pay with cash it cost a 1.25 extra...get a connect card.  I'll let others more familiar with the South Hills answer your non-transit questions, but bikes are allowed on the T at all times now (they weren't until a couple years ago). [Port Authority Bike Policy](http://www.portauthority.org/paac/RiderServices/BikesonTransit.aspx) Avoid eye contact.  Just to expand:

>*Bikes are allowed on the Port Authority's light rail system – commonly known as the T – at all times in either direction. Riders may load/unload their non-folding bikes at high-platform stations only. View a light rail system map that identifies high-platform stations.*  

>*Two bikes are permitted per light rail vehicle and must be stowed in the designated wheelchair spaces. Persons in wheelchairs have priority over bicycles.*

>*Be sure to hold onto your bike securely while on the T and keep it clear of aisles and doorways. Bicycles must be walked at all times when accessing Port Authority T stations.*

[-PAT](http://www.portauthority.org/paac/RiderServices/BikesonTransit.aspx) I'll give it a try if I get a chance. I haven't done that before, but it definitely seems like something worth collecting the communication  Though its not in line with the PAT regulation, most conductors won't mind if you lean it against a door you know won't open before your stop. This allows the handicap seats to remain open, providing 3 additions seats. Though in OP's case, they don't have a need to bring it downtown with them. I'd love to help if you're serious.
