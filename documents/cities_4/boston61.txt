Boston parents deserve to party too. That's why I organized this free event in JP on Sunday. It's a cabaret with punk rock and hip hop. All the performers are parents. Oh and free indoor mini golf.  hey boston redditors,
thought you might think this was awesome.

SUNDAY, MARCH 10 is PARENTAL ADVISORY
A FREE cabaret of performances by rad parents of many genders.

It’s not a kid’s show. It’s an *awesome* show you can bring your kids to.

3pm - 5pm @ First Church in Jamaica Plain, Unitarian Universalist
6 Elliot St. JP, (right where Centre meets South, near The Monument.)

FREE and open to everyone. Healthy snacks provided! Free indoor Mini-Golf course!

Hosted by: EVAN GREER, JP’s own renegade queer riot-folk parent.

Kids can watch the show and there will be fun activities (mini golf!) and professional childcare provided in a separate room.

Expect spontaneity, social justice poetry, banjos, punk rock, heartfelt hip hop, awkward dancing, and occasional interruptions by cute kids.
