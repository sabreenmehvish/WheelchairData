Wheelchair stolen from teen with disability | KSL.com  Hopefully spreading the word will help this family find this guys wheel chair.  What a terrible thing to happen! I hope this gets seen, that kid needs his chair back!

If he needed just a mode of transportation, I have the electric wheelchair my grandmother left behind when she passed. I'm sure she would love to know that it would be used by someone that needed it. I feel sorry for this kid.  I hope he gets his chair back.  Theft victims should have the option of beating the thief until they just get too damn tired to continue.
