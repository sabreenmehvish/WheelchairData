5th and Washington So at about 6 pm at 5th and Washington today the corner was closed with caution tape.  It looked there was maybe a dead body in a wheelchair.  Does anyone have any information about this?  I've been thinking about it all night wondering what was going on.  I think this may be related :

 I guess this is where I'll tell the story of the time I saw someone die downtown. My friend used to live in one of those sketchy residential hotels around the brewery blocks just south of Burnside. There were some interesting characters in that building. One night we came down from his apartment and onto the sidewalk, and there were two hobos arguing. It went thusly:

"You want some of this?"  
"Grrrr!"  
"*You want some of this?!*"  
"*GRRRR!!!*"

And then he decked him and the growling guy fell backwards, stiff as a board, and lands on his back in the street. We walked away and I didn't think much of it until I later found out that medics came and he died. :/ [deleted] oh snap! Yes this definitely seems to be the same thing.  Thanks for linking this.  Its hard to think about how many times I might have walked by this person and never taken the time to help or even acknowledge them.  I guess its a bit of a wake up call.  If you walk through downtown at any given time you will pass by multiple people that are slumped over, passed out, sleeping on the street.  I don't think it's reasonable to say that you should get up close and examine them for breathing each time you see someone. You make it sound like nobody cared that he was dead which I really don't think is fair to say.
