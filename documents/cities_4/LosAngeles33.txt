**A few words about Dockweiler**: Whilst it may not be the most beautiful beach in Los Angeles, it is the only beach in LA where you can legally have a bonfire. It is located directly underneath LAX, so it can get a bit loud, but if you like airplanes it’ll be the most magical place on Earth. Beach wheelchairs are also available.

**Parking**: 

 * *Public lots*: there is ample parking that costs around $10 (cash only). Disabled parking is free. A [carpool thread](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/messages/boards/thread/13906431) has been started for this occasion.  
 * *Cycling*: there’s an awesome bike trail that runs alongside Dockweiler Beach.  
 * *Roadside*: there is free parking along the roadside if you can find it.

It's easy to find parking along the road, but they start ticketing at 10pm SHARP. I got to my car at 10:05 to find a $60 ticket.

Also, I've taken booze with me every time and never had any issues. Most people here after dark are drinking. I wouldn't worry about it. This is like down the street from me :D I'll be there! This is right down the street, I definitely want to go. I'll see who I can round up! I will bring foods!  Probably smores stuff and some hot gogs whoaa!!! I love that place... I'm definitely going... first ever reddit meetup for me :) If you're going to set up the bonfire, be sure to have someone bring something to distinguish that certain bonfire (like an lightsaber or something) or to direct them to which Lifeguard tower the bonfire is closer to. The one closest to the $10 parking lot is either # 55 or 54, can't remember.

Hope this helps [deleted] I'll also bring some bottles of *water* and *apple juice* (wink wink nudge nudge say-no-more) Oh man, sounds excellent. I'll be out of town. Hope this repeats soon. [deleted] If you live on the Westside, riding your bike over could be the way to go if parking's an issue.

Just take the Ballona Creek bike path to the bridge, then take the bridge south to the beach bike path and take that south to Dockweiler. oh god dockweiler. Took two hours to park a mile away it was so packed, ended up getting an unjustified parking ticket from cops, rusty nails in the sand... just a horrible day all around. The first and only time I've gone to Dockweiler, I was parked on the street.  I ran to my car at 10:01 PM to make it back in the nick of time, with the metermaid a few cars down from me.  I tried entering the paid parking lot, but he said it was closed (if you were in before closing time, you weren't required to leave, but they wouldn't take any new people).  I drove around looking for parking everywhere, but it was literally impossible, so I had to go home.

Just something to keep in mind, so the party doesn't come to an early end. I've never been to Dockweiler, but was going to scout it out this Saturday.  Are you allowed to park all night in the neighborhood that's south of Imperial Frwy and east of the treatment plant? just vouching for what letcha said. If you park on Highland make sure your car is OUT of there by 10pm on the money or you'll get a ticket. Went to a bonfire last week and walked up to my car at 10:10 and the dude was about to write me one.  Are these games every Saturday?  The only reference I could find to aerospace games at dockweiler was something happening this Saturday (July 23).  The bonfire is scheduled for Aug 6. This is relevant to my spectatorial interests. If you're referring to El Segundo, I believe you can park there overnight. You should be fine in the residential zones, but don't quote me on any of this. I'm pretty sure you're right.
