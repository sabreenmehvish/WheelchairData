What were the WEIRDEST acts you've seen anyone do anywhere around Oakland? Apparently Oakland is full of people far weirder than you'd find in smaller towns.

Seeing what they do can make or break your day.

I wonder what weird shit you've seen that made your day? That broke it?

BTW, bonuses for anyone with pics & vids of weird shit happening! I'm sure someone can top this, but saw a guy in a wheelchair get a handjob from this woman on international + 60's openly during the daytime.  This one time I met a person who OWNED a home.  naked senior citizens sensually blow-drying their pubes while winking at me at the uptown YMCA On Friday, I unintentionally witnessed a woman drop trou and shit while standing over a red plastic washbasin. This was near a pedestrian overpass in a residential area in East Oakland.  Oakland seems tame after walking through the shooting gallery that exists between the Library and the Asian Art Museum... damn, do you have to shoot that in her neck on the curb? Really? Damn... Pearl the records keeper shopping in a wheelchair with a mega-sized cup of _something_ in her cupholder. Someone tried to sell me a chainsaw, wrapped in a garbage bag, over a 6' fence for $20.  homeless sex forsure, too much in oakland in my short time. , old homeless dude jacking it in wheelchair. constant ranting from homeless people about some crazy deep ass shit on the dizzay bissay. you know who i haven't seen in a long ass minute? crusty younger peeps who never ask for jobs but for money. used to seem like they owned the streetz, never see them at all really these days.  Oakland is known for its crime, right?

Seems he was trying to dispose of his murder weapon profitably.
