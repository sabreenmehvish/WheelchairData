A solution to the locked up Muni seats may be near  > ‚ÄúSince the time the manufacturer requested that we take this safety measure, we noticed that passengers sit on the locked seats,‚Äù said Paul Rose, a spokesman for the SFMTA.

Dude is a friggin' genius. I like that spot. Standing on it right now on 31bx üôÉ Nice. I understand why they had to lock them for safety reasons (if you get hurt sitting there, it's your fault for ignoring it and you can't easily sue), but an actual solution is appreciated. Good to see Muni solving problems (slowly). Frankly the answer is simple:

Mount the seat BACKWARDS  (back facing front of bus)

The place can still contain the wheelchair anchor, and you can have a fold down seat on the driver-side wall when there's no wheelchair. 

Not as cheap as the pole, but then a pole is going to restrict the wheelchair going in, IMHO. We shall see.  It's my 2nd favorite spot on the bus. I prefer this to having the seat down tbh but oh well. After 2 years, these poles they are installing better be amazing.
