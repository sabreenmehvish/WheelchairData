Missing Person If anyone recalls seeing a man in a motorized wheelchair on the Eastbank Esplanade or Max yesterday afternoon, please contact the detective in the linked article. We - family and friends - are extremely concerned about his well-being. Thank you.

I saw a motorized wheelchair sitting across from the 122nd Max station yesterday. Noone was around it, and I thought it was kind of strange to just be there with noone in sight. praying for his well being.  I don't know specifically how old is, but if you could please call the detective and let her know about this, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you! Could have been someone who went by ambulance to the hospital, ambulances have no way to transport electric wheelchairs. Let me kick in some thoughts and we can be useless buddies!
