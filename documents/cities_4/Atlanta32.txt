Most affordable housing near Georgia Tech I've just accepted a job with Georgia Tech Athletics. I've posted here before, but I'm interested to see where the most affordable, safe housing is in the area. I have a few accessibility needs due to a physical disability (no wheelchair) that mainly center around transportation! Anyone know anything our have recommendations? If you want to be really close to campus, then Home Park is probably the most affordable. It's literally right across the street from campus, and you can get a room there for $500 + utilities per month. It's definitely not the nicest neighborhood, but you could do worse too. Plus, Antico (one of the best pizza places in the country) is in Home Park. I live in Home Park largely because of the affordable rent. Amenities aren't fantastic, but they're not bad either. Be sure to physically visit before you sign though, some of the houses in the neighborhood will be more physically accessible than others. For example, my house has a steep gravel driveway I didn't know about until I moved in. Home Park is also up and coming--compare the newer homes there to the older ones that have been around since the 1950s, and it's clear it's undergoing the same gentrification that's going on (and is mostly completed) throughout the rest of Midtown. If I had the money I'd invest in property there; it's a great location and I have no doubt it'll be worth a lot more in five years than it is now. You right
