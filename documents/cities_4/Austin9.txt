Burnet Rd & 183  This sign is older than the internet.  Reposts in real life are you new here? Crutches AND wheels? C'mon guy. "Wait, how are you gonna do kung-fu from a wheelchair? Show me an example while I video you and I'll give you a dollar." Man I miss Leslie.  Must have been a Black Friday sale on cardboard and markers, I saw a lot of “new” signs while out today  he's dressed nicer than me oh boy how clever maybe next we'll see someone with a "why lie, I need a beer" sign LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL r/Austin has the best bums  And has been displayed at that part of that intersection for years now and worn out soles on his shoes I imagine.  Whole lot of iffy going on there.  I saw him the other day and he stood up out of chair in place to get some cash out of his back pocket to give to some lady.
