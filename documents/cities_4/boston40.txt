Dear /r/Boston, my friend has set up a fundraiser for Jeff Bauman. You may recognize him as the man who had his arteries held while being pushed on a wheelchair. Jeff has partial medical insurance but not enough to cover all costs from his injuries. Think we can raise $5000 to help cover his costs?  There already is a well established fund for Jeff.  He's already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, as well as offers to cover medical costs. He has an official fundraiser that already has $400,000.
