Metro's new trolleybus prototype has landed  Yep, looks like a bus.  Aw yis single seats for the socially awkward! How is this any different from all the other electric busses? Yaaay purple buses. I'll miss the back window but air conditioning would be nice. Yay! I'm excited for these... a massive step up from the old ones, although those ones had something resembling the Barcalounger (or dare I say, the La-Z-Boy, although that applies more to seats on SoundTransit buses) of bus seats. I eagerly await seeing one of these at the Hanford St. turnaround at the end of the 14 close to where I live.  Those look great.

I can't wait to stumble onto a #10 to make my way back home  Those seats don't look comfortable at all. Wait, I thought Metro didn't have enough money to keep bus routes so how can they afford this? It looks very modern and European. I don't like it one bit. * Air conditioning
* Low floors allowing for wheelchair ramps instead of slower lifts
* Battery backup so they won't get stranded in intersections
* Anti-slide seats like the Orions
* Better wheelchair securing system
* More standing room near the rear door
* More handholds including straps for standing passengers
* More efficient powertrain (brand new instead of 20-40 years old) and lighter weight
* Auto-deploy poles like on the old tunnel buses

Some pretty good improvements there. They look exactly like the seats that are on the rapidride buses. They aren't that bad. Yeah, they don't *look* comfortable, but having sat in that type of seat countless times, they're actually quite nice. I don't really know if I like the plasticy cushy green seats or these blue ones better though. I actually like these seats. The fact that they're thinner means that even with the same distance from one row to the same point on the next, there's more legroom/room for backpacks or suitcases. Or dogs, in my case. I agree.   If they are like the Rapid Ride seats they are like riding on wood.  www.amazon.com/Rose-Donut-Cushion-Large-Diameter/dp/B000Y9WQOU/

Costs less than 1/3 of the new car tab increase, and is good for unlimited rides on the entire Metro system. Capital money != operating money. anti slid seats, OMG I love it >* Auto-deploy poles like on the old tunnel buses

But will they fall off less often?  Personally, I like the older seats. Much more comfortable. And while I am going to miss that rear window, the AC will be great for getting home in the summer. >Anti-slide seats like the Orions

I was sad when i saw this in the picture. those seats, which are also on the rapid ride buses, are the fucking worst seats they've ever had. They're somehow even less comfortable than those plastic school chairs. I've never ridden one of the buses with those seats and not gotten off with a back ache or ass cramp.

Even the seats they had on those 70s-era buses they drove right up until the late 90s, or the annihilated seats in the old MAN buses were infinitely better.

All the other stuff is awesome, though.  Ohhhh HELL yes! This sounds like heaven, having to take the bus home every day. Continues to share (clog?) the road with cars & commercial traffic, making them as slow and unreliable as every other bus in the system.

There's a reason why grade separated transit gets so much praise.  It isn't the quality of seat... Yea the newer Aline buses have those seats and also the new wheel chair hook ups. Not to bad.  Why can't they take some of that capital money and make it be operating money? With the battery backup, if they do fall off the bus will still be able to drive and reset the poles when it can do it out of an intersection or at the next bus stop. To a degree, but one nice thing I forgot to mention is that the poles will quickly retract to prevent damage to the overhead infrastructure whenever they do fall off.  The older ones do that to an extent, but these will be faster at it. weird random detail, seattle was the only city to order those buses with back windows. There's no real explanation for why they did, or why no one else did, but they special ordered them with the windows. 

yea i know, /r/mildlyinteresting... but it is.  I know, the current seats are much more comfy for bumpy streets. Course people probably fell asleep in them. We need both. Most of it's from the Feds, who prohibit what you suggest. In addition to what xxpor said, there has been a significant amount of budget shuffling to avoid major cuts in the past few years. But the recession started quite a few budget cycles ago, and the recovery (at least in terms of Metro's revenue source) has been much slower than expected. So there's no money left to shuffle from other funds or budget categories towards maintaining operations.  Also, if you put off capital upgrades for too long, major problems start to arise. They're great when climbing Queen Anne Ave because you can just watch the skyline rise up. Especially at sunset. I forget where, but I heard that drivers like being able to look out the back windows to keep track of the wires that go to the poles. The seats on the current trolleybuses are the Barcaloungers of transit seats.  Ah that explains it. They had rear windows on the diesel gillig phantoms too, though. The got the trolley ones to match them, as far as I know. 

It's actually a sordid tale how we ended up with those trolleys. They were ordered with no engine or transmission, then the ones from the 70s trolley buses were rebuilt and installed in most of them. Only a few got new motors because that was way cheaper because holy shit is that a ton of copper.  Same deal with rapidride, by the way. The setup cost and cost of the buses was something like 80% from the feds.
