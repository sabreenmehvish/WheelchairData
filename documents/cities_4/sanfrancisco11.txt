Uber: Disability Laws Don’t Apply to Us  Funny. As a deaf person, I actually use Uber as an accessible alternative to taxis - calling taxis by tapping an app on my phone is *far* more accessible than calling a taxi's phone number and trying to talk my way through getting a taxi dispatched to where I'm at. FWIW, TNC (such as Uber) in California MUST allow user to specify if they require a wheelchair accessible vehicle, as per CPUC application form:

http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/1788F1F1-EA38-4B68-B221-4116994F2252/0/TNC_App_Instrctns.pdf

I honestly can't tell who's in the right here. You can sort of argue this either way. Does the Uber app even have the option of summoning a wheelchair accessible vehicle? And if they do, and the passenger chose not to use it, is it the passenger's fault or the driver's fault? And where does Uber's responsibility begin or end?  FWIW, Uber does explicitly offer a wheelchair accessible version of their app, [UberWAV](http://blog.uber.com/tag/uberwav/) in NY, LA, SF, Manilla and San Diego.

It seems like they only start offering this service in response to lawsuits and I have no idea if it actually works well or not. Uber seems content to have it's reputation destroyed by being utter assholes to everyone on the belief that it doesn't matter because people will still ride with Uber anyway. I can't believe the things the driver said to her. Fuck all that noise. Just for grins, here's the relevant ADA law:

>Sec. 37.29 Private entities providing taxi service.

>(a) Providers of taxi service are subject to the requirements of this part for private entities primarily engaged in the business of transporting people which provide demand responsive service.

>(b) Providers of taxi service are not required to purchase or lease accessible automobiles. When a provider of taxi service purchases or leases a vehicle other than an automobile, the vehicle is required to be accessible unless the provider demonstrates equivalency as provided in Sec. 37.105 of this part. A provider of taxi service is not required to purchase vehicles other than automobiles in order to have a number of accessible vehicles in its fleet.

>(c) Private entities providing taxi service shall not discriminate against individuals with disabilities by actions including, but not limited to, refusing to provide service to individuals with disabilities who can use taxi vehicles, refusing to assist with the stowing of mobility devices, and charging higher fares or fees for carrying individuals with disabilities and their equipment than are charged to other persons.

As described in the dailybeast article, the driver who refused to stow the wheelchair was guilty of violating (c). And the driver who griped about it all the way was guilty of being a real **** but had not violated any regulations. 

http://www.fta.dot.gov/12876_3906.html >The suits demand Uber abide by the ADA, but **Uber claims that because it’s a technology company, not a transportation service**, it doesn’t fall under the ADA’s jurisdiction.

This isn't your every day bullshit, this is advanced bullshit. >activists say Uber and other ride-sharing applications like Lyft and SideCar, called Transportation Network Companies, have abused a gray zone they operate in between technology and transportation without clear federal regulation or oversight. 

It's not just Uber but all these companies that operate independent contractors — some drivers are just assholes. But putting uber in the title gets you clicks, I guess. [deleted] Uber has [a line of wheelchair-accessible vehicles](http://blog.uber.com/nyc-uberwav) they are piloting currently in New York City 

The title is misleading, and this post has nothing to do with San Francisco. 
 What *really* needs to happen is somebody SUE the drivers, and include Uber in the lawsuit for "inadequate training". 

Yes, the drivers are being dicks, and sometimes the sedans *do* have trunks that are smaller than expected, but if sedans are willing to bungee cord the trunks with an extra piece or two of luggage (something you see all the time on limos), they ought to be able to handle a wheelchair. 

In the meanwhile, I expect the PUC to get involved and slap down a couple of these drivers for ADA non-compliance. 

FWIW, Lyft has a plan already in place, however, I don't know how far along are they into implementation. 

http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/A3FC8D18-83A1-42A4-B88D-DC74711702E3/0/LyftPlanonAvoidingDivideBetweenAbleandDisabledCommunities122313.pdf The legal guillotine poised over Uber just got a little bit sharper. This case basically boils down to the same core issue as the other big suit they have to face regarding employee status.

And FWIW, I think they know both cases are losers, but it's more profitable to drag them out for years while they focus on 'hypergrowth' before settling.

It's a sad reality that in a lot of industries it's simply more profitable to consistently break the law and just pay the fine if you do end up getting caught and losing the case. The sad thing is with the power of their transportation networks, they could easily be offering great service to disabled customers. Instead they're just fighting against each other and ignoring any customer who doesn't fit the mold.

They shouldn't need regulation to tell them that should look after customers with a wheelchair or other impairment.  Nor should they.  To require all its freelance layperson drivers to be handycapable is unfeasible nonsense, they have something for them explicitly as mentioned elsewhere. Suppose the courts decide that Uber is legally correct, and the ADA legitimately does not apply to them. What if--and I know this is crazy but just go with me for a second here--they just made sure to not treat people in wheelchairs like shit, not because of the ADA but just because it would be, you know, like, a good thing to do? Do you want more government regulation? This is how you get more government regulation. At some point Uber is going to get hit with a cease and desist order and then get sued to oblivion.

It's a nice convenience but their bullshit is way too over the top  Time to start using Lyft I suppose.  Fuck taxis.   Fuck uber. They were a free market solution to the problem of taxis being inefficient and now they are reaping the consequences. Drivers are being paid less and less, commissions are going up, and uber drivers are striking and quitting as a result. This is exactly why taxis ended up being an exclusive and expensive group to begin with... because flooding the market with taxis means no one gets a fair shake. Now rather than a few people having gainful employment, we have a ton of poor and hardworking taxis and ubers.

People gleefully welcomed uber and turned their back on longstanding city taxis, without even considering that they weren't hurting the taxi companies, but mainly working class drivers. We betrayed them. And now that problems arise from uber--traffic congestion, rapey drivers, bad drivers, mean drivers, people start to give a shit. San Francisco royally mishandled the uber-taxi situation. Seriously, why do people still use them when there's Flywheel? Cuz y'kno... Sharing! Fuck all these venture vultures. 


Sharing economy my ass. Greedy fucks.  Hope they burn. 

San Francisco is a guinea pig for tech culture.   

So man bland, boring ideas. Most of the tech people I've met are automatons.   

Wall street west out here. I hope it burns hard. 



Which it will, eventually. When, I don't know.   


 The article's title is incorrect, it should read:

Über: Laws Don't Apply To Us. 

/s
 Don't worry, the SF cab companies never answer their phones anyway, you're not missing anything. Flywheel > TNC (such as Uber) in California...

Claiming to not be a TNC is central to uber's argument.  They contend that they just provide the software; the drivers are contractors, and thus personally responsible for things like ADA compliance:

>>Uber claims that because it’s a technology company, not a transportation service, it doesn’t fall under the ADA’s jurisdiction.

This is of course hard to swallow.

> Does the Uber app even have the option of summoning a wheelchair accessible vehicle? 

UberWAV is mentioned in the article, yes.  Although it's availability is limited > Does the Uber app even have the option of summoning a wheelchair accessible vehicle?

For what it's worth - yes, you can summon an Uber Black Car, and select SUV. They may have UberWAV and it may be an option on the app, but there are no vehicles. I have checked multiple times from my office on downtown Market and there is never a vehicle available during the day let alone if I want to use one at night. >Uber seems content to have it's reputation destroyed by being utter assholes to everyone on the belief that it doesn't matter because people will still ride with Uber anyway.

They're figuring out what the taxi drivers had already figured out: When you're the only game in town, you can treat people however the fuck you want. The nice thing is their dominance is short-lived because they made a business model that's vulnerable to competition. Yeah, driver's a dick. So what's Uber's role in this?  Technically speaking, Uber operates NO vehicles. All uber vehicles are operated by their subcontractors under their own authority, with Uber operating strictly as booking service. 

It'd be much like asking Hotel.com for ADA compliance of all the hotel they book for, or ask travelocity for FAA compliance.  Uber and the other rideshare companies are thinking of themselves as iTunes or match.com. iTunes is a middleman between artist and audience, reducing the friction in the market by keeping things organized, allowing the audience to find the music they want easily. Or match.com serves as a middleman allowing people to find someone to date more easily, handling the organization of the preferences and profiles, and making suggestions based upon some algorithm.

So Uber says, "we are just a middleman between driver and passenger, reducing the friction in the market by keeping things organized, allowing the passengers to find a ride easily."

But lawmakers aren't likely to see it that way.  Regulation hasn't caught up to things like Uber because the entire concept is enabled by extremely recent technology.  I think eventually Uber will be reigned in and forced to comply with things like ADA and other public protection laws in some manner. I'm not an Uber fan, but I'm pretty sure if they were a transportation service (a livery) they would have to abide by all the taxi laws, medallion bullshit, etc. 

Legally, I wouldn't be surprised that dictating something like ada compliance of drivers who they only provide info to would legitimize the claim they are a taxi company, which would fuck them up.  This is nucking futs. Even technology companies have to abide by the ADA (ramps on their buildings, elevators, allowing service animals on premises, etc.) The spirit of the law is that Uber should not be able to wriggle out of accommodating the handicapped by mischaracterizing the service it is providing. 

Alternately, are we supposed to sue each individual Uber driver for their individual violation of the ADA? after all, i guess Uber is just providing a service to thousands of one-man transportation companies.

The results would be Uber losing many, many drivers who don't want to be sued. 

I'm sick of " market disruption" meaning "we don't want to abide by the regulations or play by the rules that our competitors must, which were put in place to protect the public". Most airlines have proprietary software to operate their systems and their website. Can I start an airline, claim it's "a technology company, not an airline" and then ignore the FAA rules? > My bet is they're working on a one-size-fits-all tech solution for this problem and stalling elsewhere while they develop it. I don't think they actually have their heads stuck in the sand-- they're just delaying until they can fix the problem instead of having a solution handed down to them by each and every government they deal with.

The most logical opinion in this comment thread. I have only ridden in taxis that are not wheel chair accessible. How do those companies get around this? What are you talking about? It's a tech company hate post, and therefore has everything to do with /r/sanfrancisco No they have subcontract with borough cabs (you can only use them to travel between boroughs) and in the case of SF I don't know of a single accessible vehicle. I would love to use Uber, because frankly the cab companies are crap for folks in chairs just like everyone else, but at least they have vehicles. Yes, its wrong that Uber doens't follow ADA regulations.  That doesn't mean we should punish the drivers! They are independent contractors, trying to make a living. 

~~Its like going to a restaurant and suing all the employees because the restaurant didn't have an ADA bathroom.~~

EDIT- Ok, its like treating the symptoms not the problem.  > Last year, Uber launched UberWAV, which is partnering with drivers in nine cities who own their own wheelchair-ramp vans to serve those in mechanical chairs. Uber also launched a service called UberASSIST at the beginning of the year. It uses drivers who are specially trained to assist seniors and people with disabilities (though not including ramp cars) and is in the midst of setting up across the country.
 No other cab company is required to make all their vehicles accessible. The standard is that the system be accessible for people in wheelchairs. The only thing I can see uber doing is implementing more intensive training before they allow a driver to sign up. After all, how is uber supposed to do anything when an individual driver won't let a wheelchair user in the car? It's not like the company has a policy where they tell all their drivers "hey guys, just remember that you don't have to comply with the ADA because we're not a taxi company". In fact, it says in the article that drivers are typically suspended or fired if uber finds out they have violated the ADA because it says in their contract that the drivers must follow the law.

Furthermore, it looks like uber is at least making some effort in light of all these lawsuits: 

> Last year, Uber launched UberWAV, which is partnering with drivers in nine cities who own their own wheelchair-ramp vans to serve those in mechanical chairs.

I don't think it's fair to say that uber as a company treats wheelchair users like shit. Unless of course you believe clickbait headlines without a second thought. >Now rather than a few people having gainful employment, we have a ton of poor and hardworking taxis and ubers.

This logic is completely fallacious. You're basically saying it's better to have a few people making a lot of money than a lot of people making less money. Do you actually believe this?

>because flooding the market with taxis means no one gets a fair shake.

Actually, fair pricing is *exactly* what results from a more granular, more competitive market.

>without even considering that they weren't hurting the taxi companies

Do you know anything about medallion systems, taxi commissions, etc.? Also, yes, taxi drivers are usually poor. They're also usually shitty at their jobs. They face no consequences whatsoever for failing to maintain their cars (mechanically and aesthetically), and they regularly break rules and laws surrounding payment methods. "Sorry, card machine broken. Cash only." Also, how many times has a taxi driver taken you on the scenic route and charged you 50% more than the trip should cost? That doesn't happen with Uber. If it does, the driver gets fired.

>traffic congestion, rapey drivers, bad drivers, mean drivers

You're not going to prevent people from raping and kidnapping other people by not letting them drive people around for money. Your traffic congestion argument has nothing to back it up. If anything, people are taking Ubers instead of their own cars because they don't want to drive home drunk. Are you saying it's better to let those people drive on the road late at night, or take them off via uber?

Sorry, but you're making some very very bad arguments here. Please don't blame the traffic on Uber. That is silly.

The sheer population of people in the area compared to the infrastructure to move them around is what causes traffic. There would still be traffic without Uber, those people would just take cabs (or own their own cars) or shove themselves onto the already full BART or MUNI options. Price, and general look of the vehicles. Flywheel (i.e. revamped deSoto) are nice, but you can't really compare interior of a taxi with interior of a sedan or limo. If I want cheap, I may as well go Lyft.  I smell green jelly Again, Flywheel. > Claiming to not be a TNC is central to uber's argument.

I honestly have NO IDEA what the **** you're talking about, because Uber has ALREADY RECEIVED a TNC permit from the CPUC, and they even BRAGGED about it on their own blog. 

http://blog.uber.com/TNCpermit

Technically it's one of their subsidiaries, but if they advertised so, they will be held accountable as so.  TNC is what Uber claims to be, what the don't claim to be is a Taxi company. From what I can tell, they do have that option. Thats what I figured. Yeah, I downloaded it out of curiosity, no vehicles available. Seems to be just a front so they can claim they offer handicap service. > When you're the only game in town, you can treat people however the fuck you want. 

Uber is *far* from the only game in town. Not for long. Uber isn't just a hailing app - with data analytics (traffic flow, passenger habits), they'll have an efficiency edge that won't be easily replicable. My 2¢ Uber is saying that because they operate in a grey area of not *technically* being a taxi service, they don't have to comply with the ADA.  On the other hand, presumably all the hotels on Hotels.com comply with the respective rules and regulations. You can't really say this for the drivers that you find on Uber or the spaces you find on Airbnb. But you can say it for all the drivers you find on Flywheel.

Uber may not operate the vehicles directly, but don't they act as employers of some form to the drivers? They seem to be much more than a middleman between the driver and the customer. Yeah, I feel like I'll be buried for sticking up for Uber here, but I blame the drivers in these cases. I think Uber should (but may not be legally obligated to) provide information on ADA compliance to their drivers, make them check some "I understand" box, and then its on the drivers. Those drivers that wouldn't pick up the woman in the story should have the pants sued off of them, not Uber. It's shady but true. They're riding the ridge incredibly well.  Exactly. The whole reason they can get around medallion laws and the limits on taxis is because they aren't a transportation company.  Technically speaking Ross Ulbricht is NOT a drug dealer. Let's see how that works out for him. [deleted] Actually taxi laws are completely separate from livery laws, at least in California.  So you're saying that Square has to ensure that every business that uses them is ADA compliant? NOPE I bet their website doesn't comply with Ada standards. Since they are a private company they don't have to comply so I guess we can kinda grumble.  > Even technology companies have to abide by the ADA (ramps on their buildings, elevators, allowing service animals on premises, etc.) 

No, they don't. If the business doesn't regularly serve the public, then they don't fall under that. 
 It's more of a gray area than that. Under its current structure, Uber does not employ drivers or purchase/maintain vehicles. A more analogous comparison would be that you made a website/app to connect private pilots with people wanting flights. In this case, you would likely not be involved in FAA regulation compliance of the individuals flights; that would fall to the individual pilots.

Not defending Uber here, but I will say that this is not a black-and-white issue. What. Those two things are not even close to the same.  No. They don't. A portion of their fleet has to have wheelchair accessible vehicles. Hold on a second: Are you seriously suggesting that this sub is more anti-tech than pro-tech and pro-change? You're high as fuck, son. I like you.  Drivers are the actual owners and operators of the vehicles, and are the ones who refused service, NOT UBER. Thus your restaurant analogy is way off.  These services could be HUGE for a lot of people.   No one has signed up for them. I have never seen an actual vehicle in SF. "Fair" pricing is not what occurs when a market is completely freed up. It reaches an equilibrium, but that equilibrium can mean a bunch of underpaid workers. By your logic unions would be fundamentally counter productive and the "fair" price of your labor would be determined by the free market. We've seen what that results in in the past--it results in shitty working conditions and then... unions! Which is why uber drivers have started to create associations with each other and strike when they don't like a commission increase or a new fee. It's a little bit of a "point proven" moment for those of us who had even a shred of sympathy for the taxi drivers whose livelihoods were completely undermined by uber. I see collapse.  Would supporting flywheel be supporting those same people who never answered their phones, before Uber/Lyft broke their monopoly? They bragged that a subsidiary got the permit, presumably that means that only the subsidiary will (automatically) be treated as an TNC. Right? Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Summon, *Taxis*.

I honestly am wondering where all these asshole drivers are. I choose Lyft over Uber, but in all my time taking a variety of services I've had **one** bad ride that wasn't a taxi. > Uber isn't just a hailing app

You can't hail an uber. Uber cars are 100% dispatched through the software to you.  They don't, because they don't actually operate the vehicles. The company that operate the vehicles is on the hook for ADA violations. See FTA 37.29(a)

http://www.fta.dot.gov/12876_3906.html The problem here is Uber has much deeper pockets, and generally who has the deepest pocket gets sued.  Let's be real here.  Uber is operating a taxi service.  I know they want to dress it up as some kind of collection of independent small business owners plying their wares or whatever, but look at the actual situation.  Uber arranges transportation for customers, it collects a fare that it determines for the service the drivers provide, and then it pays the drivers a wage that it determines appropriate for their service.  

The idea that each and every Uber driver should be responsible for learning and following each and every relevant law and rule is just silly.  Uber, which is their employer in every aspect but name, should be responsible for these kinds of things.  It's absolutely not acceptable to have an environment in which the law has to be applied on a case-by-case basis to each one of the thousands of "independent contractors" that happen to get caught. Technically he is convicted of aiding and abetting drug dealers, which is still a crime. The independent punching fry cook would be the owner of the establishment you walked into, he's paying McDonalds money to use their name. McDonalds would fire him. Uber would "fire" him. Every fucking employer would fire that person. *And* you could press charges.

**BUT I MEAN THAT'S LIKE THE SAME THING AS WHEN UBER DRIVERS MAKE MEAN COMMENTS TO HANDICAPABLE PEOPLE AND UBER DOESN'T SAY, "SORRY, WE VIOLATED THE ADA HERE'S A BILLION DOLLARS."** My apologies for the assumption.  But the point is that if Uber is considered to be in control of those cars, they will be in violation.

They sell the information, not the ride.

The laws are ancient and need to be updated, until they are, these games get played. But offices that employ people have to adhere to those standards.  I disagree.  Liability falls back to Uber for not providing the necessary infrastructure for passengers with ADA needs.


Sidecar for example, when registering for a new driver account, specifically ask you if you and your vehicle are able to pick up and drive passengers with ADA needs.  Moreover, Sidecar also ask passengers if they require a vehicle for their ADA needs.  


As of May of 2015, Uber dose not offer this option to existing and new drivers.  An Opt in / Opt out for drivers would solve this problem.  Again no need to punish the drivers, punish uber.  None of what you said follows from what I said.  I see a little silhouetto of a man. SCARAMOUCHE, SCARAMOUCHE will you do the *fandango*? It would be supporting drivers who have actually been trained, licensed, and vetted. 

And they don't have surge pricing.  That's what they operate under in California, "dba Uber".  Likewise. I use uber very frequently in ny and sf due to work travel and have never once had a bad experience. I think most of them value their "rating" because uber slaps them on the wrist if they have sub par reviews.   > I honestly am wondering where all these asshole drivers are.

This article is written by, and likely OP himself is, either Lyft, Sidecar, Summons or a taxi driver. 

Uber's the most successful company in a highly competitive, new, emerging market. All these other companies want Uber GONE and will post all sorts of shit like this all day every day.   Whoa sorry that's what I meant. *it's not just a tool to get a car to you  > The idea that each and every Uber driver should be responsible for learning and following each and every relevant law and rule is just silly.

For regular Uber / black, that's exactly what they should, because they are ALREADY licensed through the PUC (i.e. have their own livery plates). 

You can argue this for Lyft or the UberX (i.e. private cars), but arguing that for regular Uber is a nonstarter.  Hmm, couldn't the same still be said for Uber? I personally don't see the law needs changing, but then I'm not a lawyer. Here's Sec 37.29 of ADA 

>Sec. 37.29 Private entities providing taxi service.

>(a) Providers of taxi service are subject to the requirements of this part for private entities primarily engaged in the business of transporting people which provide demand responsive service.

>(b) Providers of taxi service are not required to purchase or lease accessible automobiles. When a provider of taxi service purchases or leases a vehicle other than an automobile, the vehicle is required to be accessible unless the provider demonstrates equivalency as provided in Sec. 37.105 of this part. A provider of taxi service is not required to purchase vehicles other than automobiles in order to have a number of accessible vehicles in its fleet.

>(c) Private entities providing taxi service shall not discriminate against individuals with disabilities by actions including, but not limited to, refusing to provide service to individuals with disabilities who can use taxi vehicles, refusing to assist with the stowing of mobility devices, and charging higher fares or fees for carrying individuals with disabilities and their equipment than are charged to other persons.

The driver violated 37.29(c) by refusing to stow wheelchair when it can be reasonably accommodated. Uber IMHO, is at best, guilty of "lack of training", which was my position all along.  For their employees? Yeah, if they have 15 or more full time employees, then they'll have to comply. Otherwise, no.

 Which part of Uber are we talking about? Uber, Black, or X? 

Again, Uber didn't refuse the passenger. The driver did, even when reasonable accommodations (stow the wheelchair) can be arranged. I say it's the driver's fault, and at most Uber is guilty of bad training. 

From the article it seems the passenger did NOT request a wheelchair accessible vehicle, and now you're telling me there is no such option to request one on the Uber app, is that right? 

If that is so, it's against the California PUC's TNC rules, and that's ANOTHER thing to hammer them on. But the driver's hardly faultless on this one.  > Actually, fair pricing is exactly what results from a more granular, more competitive market.

Take the unskilled labor market. There is plentiful unskilled labor. In the absence of regulation, there will be downward pressure on wages because unskilled labor is replaceable. The solution to the conflict created by this in the past has been unionization and eventually minimum wage and basic labor standards. Uber undermined the artificial scarcity of taxis that was created by our city regulations, which devalued medallions and caused a lot of taxi drivers to stop making money or quit. There are good and bad aspects to this.

One good thing is that consumers get really cheap rides, faster. The cost of this is that there are a ton of drivers now which has made them all less valuable and less necessary, taxi drivers included. There has to be a medium here between an expensive and inefficient taxi service and a completely freed up taxi market. Speak to most taxi drivers and you will find that they agree something needs to be done. They don't deserve to be thrown under the bus, though. That doesn't answer my question at all. You just tried to deflect it and give an answer to a different question that puts Flywheel in a positive light, then threw in the surge pricing thing for whatever reason. 

All I wanted to know was if Flywheel was comprised of the same cabbies that I'd had such negative experiences with before Lyft/Uber came around.  Well thats the beauty of Uber. The company can be huge dicks, but the drivers have to be nice if they want to keep working. It's more than a slap on the wrist, as I understand, below a certain rating they can't drive at all. Dirt only sticks if there's something to stick to. Yes, there's a lot of powerful people gunning for Uber to fail but that doesn't hide the fact that Uber's behaviors have been far more ethically challenged than that of Lyft and Sidecar.

Lyft, for example, had a scandal a while ago where they were accused of age discrimination against their drivers. They responded in a fair and transparent manner about the situation, everyone accepted it and now barely anyone remembers it. Uber, on the other hand, is still dogged by stories about things they did years ago because they consistently refuse to own up and change their behavior. Depends on whether aiding and abeting people who don't give disabled people rides a crime. I am not a lawyer, so I don't pretend to know, but it usually isn't automatic.

Besides, do you really want it to be a crime to say "Resturant XYZ is really good" when XYZ have bad support for disabled people? To answer your question: 

1. All of UBER. 


2. Yes, as of May 2015, if I am a passenger with ADA needs there is not an option for me to notify Uber that I am of need of a vehicle that can accommodate my ADA needs.  

And yes I agree, it is against California's PUC TNC rules.  That doesn't mean we need to punish the drivers for Uber's lack of responsibility.   The solution would be, that Uber change their Terms and Condition with all the divers requiring them to pick up ADA passengers.  Not agreeing to this will terminate your driver account.  Easy fix.   their business refuses to adapt under pressures from a disruptor. They're a dinosaur. They should adapt or find other lines of work. I have little sympathy for cab drivers who haven't caught up. That's like feeling bad for typewriter mechanics when personal computers were invented.  The problem with the taxi model is they were basically granted a MONOPOLY on "quick response demand personal transportation", evern since the Great Depression when New York created the medallion system to protect the existing car services and not let any yahoo with an automobile transport people for hire. They had the monopoly for more than half a century, and that monopoly had allowed them to grow stagnant. Now they're no longer the only deal in town, of course they're screaming bloody murder. They *are* dying, and they need to adapt to play with the new rules.  It wasn't the cabbies, it was the lack of cabs, dude.  So you want to turn Uber into ADA enforcer? 

I'm not sure this particular case (not your anecdote) is an ADA issue. Seems the passenger in this case is asking for reasonable accommodation much like "weird shaped luggage", as it seems she can get in and out of vehicles, albeit slowly (she drives her own car often), and the driver refused. Uber can't be responsible for every driver who's a dick except "you're fired".  Well, from the article...

> Uber’s Code of Conduct notes that violating laws pertaining to transporting disabled riders “constitutes a breach of the parties’ licensing agreement.” And an Uber spokesperson says that reported discrimination typically ends with a driver’s suspension or deactivation.
 Uber is already an enforcer when it comes to their terms and condition.  If you don't meet a certain level of expectation you're terminated from the program.  If Uber made a clear expectation that all drivers are EXPECTED to pick up passengers with ADA needs than this solves the problem.  


And yes, Uber is responsible for every driver including their verbal and non verbal actions.
