/r/Portland Meetup Friday - Patio, Jello Shots, and Food Trucks at High Dive Before I turn things over to this week's host, a note about my personal history and these food carts. Cartlandia was my first food cart pod love upon moving to Portland; Potato Champion will always have a very special place in my heart (Palak Paneer every time), and as such Cartlandia will forever just be known as 'The Food Carts' to me. As luck would have it, I just moved within 10 blocks of them, but I've been getting more into the pod on Division and 28th.

Here's what Host Leila has to say about this week's meetup:

> It's meetup, feet-up time again, this time we're heading SE. Kick back with a frozen margerita on the patio of this awesome neighborhood bar which shares an entrance with Que Pasa Cantina. 
> 
> The owners of The High Dive have a long history working in the service industry and have devoloped a beautiful symbiotic relationship with the Cartlandia trucks next door. That means you can grab Poutine, Pizza, (and?) or a burrito next door and bring it back to the bar. This time, you CAN sit with us. 
> 
> There are rotating beers on tap, a crowded liquor shelf, wine list, and wait for it...Jello shots! I just really like how this low key bar that's playing Pearl Jam can appeal to whatever drinking stage you are in your lives right now. 
> 
> The High Dive is wheelchair accessible and the patio has smoking availability. There is going to be a live DJ spinning inside starting around 10pm. I will probably be the only one dancing. Again. One change from previous establishments is that they are dog friendly. On this note, please take into account that the patio is probably going to be loud and crowded. I do not want to be responsible for pet trauma or distress.

-------------------------------------------

I'd also like to take this time to announce our new series of Book Club meetups. Starting in August we'll get together on (usually) the first Thursday of the month and talk about a different book (current schedule below). We'll make sure to keep the reading list varied so there's a little something for everyone; feel free to skip months you're not interested in!

Join the (separate) [book club facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/111167319506071) for updates, or check in to these regular meetup threads for updates. I'll make sure to keep the reading list chosen at least 3 months in advance.

[10/5 - Disgrace by J. M. Coetzee](https://www.facebook.com/events/241957649654492) This has a higher priority than the new [weekly pet thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/6moezx/dear_portland_july_11_2017_weekly_pet_photo_thread/) so take a look at that as well if you haven't yet.  Hey, this is tonight! I have actually read The Big Sleep, but why do you schedule all meetups during times I am unable to attend? [deleted] Oops, unfortunate timing there. I held off posting this yesterday to give the rant thread some time, though. The pet thread just seems to be a place where you let BTV and r^3 run wild.  Because your campaign didn't communicate your schedule to me in a timely fashion. I'm not Aaron. :/ There are sunset/sunrise threads tomorrow but those are also low priority  We're still testing out our new picture stickies, and we're sort of hampered by the mod elections sticky as well. It's off-leash.  You did not have to downvote me. Too many stickies, not enough space. Time to petition the admins to just let us have an entire page worth of stickies. I didn't :/ I did
