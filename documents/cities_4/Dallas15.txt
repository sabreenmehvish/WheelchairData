Where's the Highest wheelchair accessible spot in the metro area on a Sunday night?!? Don't worry, I'm not looking to jump or anything. Just want to enjoy the skyline.  The Soda Bar at the top of the NYLO hotel near SouthSide has a good view. The reunion tower just opened up a new platform. You should check it out for sure!
