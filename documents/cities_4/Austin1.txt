I am recently homeless and of course broke but my friend here is in desperate need of a wheelchair. Any ideas? The one he currently uses is broken to the point of immobility. I hate to see him suffer. A quick google search netted me zippo....does anyone have any helpful suggestions of where we might go to get a replacement? Hopefully for free or if not extremely cheap. If you call 211, they can direct your to city, county, state and federal programs that might help get them a chair. Also search for an area ombudsman who could help. I work for health and human services amd that would fall under the disability area of our agency. Try the ombudsman first as 211 is a busy call center. Either should be able to help. I have an old wheelchair with no footrests. You can have it if you want it.  Call around to the Goodwill and Salvation Army stores. They receive chairs quite often from homes that have been cleared out after their occupants have passed on. AGE of Central Texas Health Equipment Lending Program

https://ageofcentraltx.org/index.php/seniors/health-equipment/ The Episcopal Church has a program for that. Do you have a gofundme for you and your friend? Reddit can change lives! Thank you so much for your info! I have no idea what an ombudsman is but I know how to use google. Good suggestion, I tried that a little bit today but so far no luck. That looks promising as well! Thank you. Wow never really thought of that. Don’t really think we deserve you good people’s money. Their has been some helpful suggestions so far I really hope one of them works. We’ll start calling around tomorrow when offices open up again. They are an advocate for the elderly and disabled. Good luck I'm up in Round Rock at the moment. I'll check the Goodwills around here since I'm done working for the day and see if I can come up with something for you.
