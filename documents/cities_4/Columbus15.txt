TIL classmate is a fellow redditor! He mentioned something about seeing a guy in a wheelchair crowd-surfing. Wow that's amazing, its almost like a lot of people go to this website or something. I'm surprised this hasn't gotten more attention. downvote for thinking I was actually excited about it, then attempting to mock me. Deadeye=dumbguy :) If you don't care, don't post it.  advice taken  or you could simply not be such an ass all the time.

PS. I upvoted you
