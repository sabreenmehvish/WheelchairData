Homeless woman on Mississippi with the black sweats I was saddened to read this post from one year ago about her apparent death: https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3dl8g8/homeless_woman_on_mississippi/

I just wanted to let everyone know, in case anyone cares, that she's alive and back on the street. She seems bound to a wheelchair at the moment. She had built quite a reputation in the past as a mean lunatic who'd spit on you without reason. I'd like to say, she is nice if you spend a minute talking to her, or at least tell her "sorry I don't have any money" when she asks. 

Otherwise, rejoice! You may be spat upon once again! maybe she could mod here  Betty is back! [deleted] I will alert my sister in law to this miracle. I'll put up with a lot.. but no one spits on me. or puts me in a corner. Wow. Back from the dead! Welcome back Betty!  no lies, if someone spits on me they get a punch to the face She is nice and appreciative if you help her a little or just be nice. I met her son once who was trying to get her some food and into a hotel. She wasn't having any of it and I could see what must be years of sadness and exasperation in his eyes. She likes candy.  She tried and failed. She is /u/biketheftvictim. 

(this is a joke, please don't ban me for doxxing) I walk to the Nu Way market every day (next to bar bar) and theres only the awesome old dude sitting on his walker.  He's basically the only panhandler ive ever seen on the street.   That must be where all the ones who I used to have to step over on Hawthorne moved. "Thanks bro, I was still figuring out what to do with my bucket of revenge spit!" she won't take shelter or food from own son, and we are supposed to help? not sure how that works  **spits on /u/explodeder**   
**shuffles away** [deleted] Save it for the mayor. I'm sure she doesn't either. She has a lot of mental problems. She can be really nice though.  That must be it, I avoid that street as if my life depended on it on the weekends.
