Need a wheelchair :( Hello all,

i was in a hit and run accident on Tuesday September 29th that has left my left side immobilized.  I received a broken tibula, fibula, femur, and scapula. I've had surgery and now have rods and screws to set my leg back to place. I'm due to go home this weekend but need help.  What i need is a wheelchair. I don't need anything too fancy but need it to be small enough for me. I'm five feet flat.  If anyone has one I can borrow for about two to three months or buy outright please let me know.  

Please PM me if you have any info or if you have a wheelchair I can use.  I can also pay .  This will make the recovery time a lot smoother and will help me to get around after my stay here at the hospital. Have you met your case manager at the hospital? This type of thing is their *job* to help you with.  I work for UC San Diego. Ask you Doctor to place a "DME Order" for a wheelchair. Then they will coordinate your insurance to authorize to pay for it. [There are several on Craigslist](http://sandiego.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=wheelchair).
  You can rent one from All Home Medical Supply in Kearny Mesa. I had friend rent one form there with no problems. Hit and runs are inexcusable. If I may ask, were you walking? Cycling? Riding? Driving? That's pretty brutal.
Sadly I don't have one to offer, but it looks like they can be had for $25 or $50, if that helps.

http://sandiego.craigslist.org/search/sss?sort=rel&max_price=50&query=wheelchair Sorry about your accident. I wish you a speedy recovery. Of you haven't already done so I suggest posting on craigslist too.  Sorry i don't have access to a chair myself, but you can also try posting on Freecycle. its like craigslist, but only for free items If you have someone in your family involved with the military or you are, a legion for vets will have them for free to use!
Also a lot of ambulance sub stations have them for community members; I have gotten them a few times from these places for family or whatever This comment has been overwritten by an open source script to protect this user&apos;s privacy.
