its 2017. wheel chairs cannot cross the street because its for cars only (woman hit by suv) (http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/sd-me-hit-run-20171107-story.html)

San Diego police are looking for the driver of an SUV that ran over a 47-year-old woman in a wheelchair in East Village over the weekend.

The woman was in the middle of F Street near Park Boulevard, outside of a marked crosswalk, when she and her wheelchair were struck by the silver, newer model SUV about 4 a.m. Saturday, police said.

The driver was going west on F Street.

The woman in the wheelchair suffered two broken femurs and a fracture to her pelvis — injuries that were serious but not life-threatening, police said.

The SUV driver stopped briefly before continuing west on F Street, north on 11th Street, then east on E Street, police said.

Police said the SUV has a tinted sun roof and chrome rims. It may have tinted windows and front-end and undercarriage damage. The woman in the SUV should not have driven off but how the hell are you supposed to see a woman in a wheel chair crossing not at a crosswalk!?!  Those lines are for your safety. I scolded a woman in Linda Vista today who couldn’t be bothered to walk the extra ten feet to the crosswalk today and almost got run over. Come on people! Wheelchair or no, don't cross outside the crosswalk. It's there for a reason. Man some real douches in this subreddit defending hit and run drivers over the people getting hit.

 Has she tried not being in a wheelchair? /s Some really disgusting people here. How the fuck are you defending a hit and run driver over an innocent woman? She was crossing the goddamn street. It's California, pedestrians have right of way. >The woman in the wheelchair suffered two broken femurs and a fracture to her pelvis — injuries that were serious but not life-threatening, police said.

ouch that is a serious injury.

Wtf is wrong with people? This driver needs to be locked away in jail for attempted murder and never given a vehicle to drive ever again.  this is sad. there should be a vulnerable user law. this is downtown where people walk. not suburbia . people over cars (soon to be robots) thats a fascist way to think. do we know the reason why she was outside it? perhaps she was going around a pothole in it? perhaps that suv hit her chair out of it and police stated that (they usually blame the victim to avoid investigations) Crosswalk or not, pedestrians have right of way. The law is there for a reason.

 We're not condoning the hit and run, we're calling out the jay(wheeler) for their stupid decision.  The driver obviously should face the penalties for hit and run.  She wasn't using a crosswalk. If the new rule is you can cross anywhere you want, you'll have to drive 5 mph so that you don't hit anyone. Don't jaywalk (or jaywheel) when there's a crosswalk literally 50 feet away.  Driver shouldn't have driven away from the scene obviously, hopefully they're found and prosecuted.  Both were in the wrong.  seriously, what the driver did is one stop away from manslaughter/murder and the people who are trying to justify her behavior really make me ill.

 There are intersection crosswalks at literally every single block downtown.  Zero excuse to not use one of them, other than simply being too lazy to walk an extra 50 feet.  was fascist your word of the day to try out? That is absolutely not true. If one hits a pedestrian who is jaywalking and no other laws are being broken (e.g. leaving the scene, DUI etc) then the jaywalker is liable Wait. Are you justifying the hit and run? The driver knew she hit a person in s wheel chair and left the scene. Any sane person would have stayed. Yup. A sane person would pull over if they hit a person. Regardless if they were crossing illegally or not. Clearly a lot of people on this sub aren’t sane.  Easy to walk, but wheelchair not always Actually it is. You might want to try reading the law sometime buddy. Pedestrians ALWAYS have right of way, there is no exception. The person got hit because they weren't in the cross walk, that's on the person that got hit. The driver should not have fled the scene, that's on the driver. Is it safe to assume the only real reasons for running from the scene of a hit and run are either you're inebriated or criminal?  okay buddy I just looked it up in the CA driver's handbook buddy. Is this document wrong too buddy?

> **Pedestrians have the right-of-way in marked or unmarked crosswalks**. Although pedestrians have the right-of-way, they also must abide by the rules of the road. A pedestrian should not suddenly leave a curb, or other place of safety, and cross into the path of a vehicle as this creates an immediate hazard. Furthermore, a pedestrian must not stop unnecessarily or delay traffic while in a crosswalk.

> Notice the qualifier or requirement: "at an intersection." So, what does this mean? **It means pedestrians do not always have the right of way, despite common belief**. Unfortunately, this causes a lot of confusion between pedestrians and drivers which oftentimes leads to an accident They made it exponentially worse for leaving the scene. They’re in a boatload of trouble.  Probably.
