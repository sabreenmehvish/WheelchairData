Aurora Bridge After Dark - Jul 5, 1932  That road up to Queen Anne looks pretty rough.  Back when the handrails were nice and jumpable. This is gorgeous. What format is the original in? Would be cool to get a larger print. That bridge seems massive to me now, I can't imagine what it felt like back then!  So cool! Would love to see more of this  does anyone know where one can find old street maps?

i'd love to know exactly what road is what in this photo to be sure. 

[edit: got it](http://www.oldmapsonline.org/en/Seattle#bbox=-122.3647663823242,47.64087588605024,-122.33535850748763,47.67236798951894&q=&date_from=1910&date_to=1950&scale_from=&scale_to=) I hate that turn in particular.  Back when jumping off the bridge was encouraged.   I thought there was a cute kitty in the bottom right corner but there's not, it's just a flaw in the image.

So disappointed. We used the sidewalk on our bikes a few months ago to get from upper QA to upper Fremont. No one expects bikes of peds at that intersection. It was super awkward as three of us scrambled so fast to get our bikes up on the pavement and not be killed by right-turning cars.  Interesting how the curb has a step cut out rather than a ramp. Crazy how then a person in a wheelchair was just shit out of luck.  I like the dirt road
 [deleted] Since the bridge was built there have been over 230 people that were set to testify the Clinton's try and walk across its span. The first one in January of 1932. TBH, 85 years later it doesn't look a whole lot better... but there was no cool software company to flop on the roof of I heard that the first guy was an unsuccessful shoe salesman.  Poor fellow took them seriously when they said capitalism is the greatest thing ever. Visit http://clerk.ci.seattle.wa.us/~public/phot1.htm and type 5859 into the search terms box.

The page with this photo is third on the list your search will return. Visit that page and you can download the hi-res file from there. It still has no ramp... ^I ^think ^the ^suicide ^fence ^looks ^pretty ^cool ^^Also ^^stops ^^suicide ^^which ^^is ^^good So you must conversely love the dismantled mental health programs, or virulent sickness of a culture that necessitate said barriers?

Fuck your view. Keep your eyes on the road. The lanes are narrow enough already. What a low energy comment.  Cool T_D bot, bro. Pulling out onto Aurora from that road really sucks, no way it would get approved today.  Yeah, whatever brought that guy to the bridge in the first place, he definitely jumped off in service of your agenda. Oh man that archive is like an r/SeattleWA karma treasurechest [you're right](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.6430673,-122.3473812,3a,75y,19.37h,57.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWOLatOqWn3BXBiL8afIjKg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en). I just assumed it would by now.  [deleted] I don't have an agenda.  I just have fifty different ways to think about myself and the world so that I never get trapped in a mental blind alley. ^saved You would probably die trying to cross that intersection in a wheelchair anyways.  Keep your eyes on the road. The six lanes of traffic ahead of you is far more important than taking in that sweeping view of Rainier on a clear day. Sorry, but it's true. or you'd get halfway across the bridge and encounter another wheelchair coming from the other side.

passers-by would stop and gawk as the two of you battled out some sort of invalid little John game to see who'd continue
