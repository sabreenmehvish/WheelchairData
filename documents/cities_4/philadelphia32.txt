What's going on in Philly tonight? Trying to get outta the since my roommates are driving me up a FUCKING WALL....anything reasonably priced events that include food/booze to wash away the stress.

Ps- I know its Ms. Liza @ Bob n Barbs tonight, but I'm not feeling being packed like sardines thing & I'm going out with my friend who's in a wheelchair so super packed joints aren't easy to maneuver. couple bands at teri's on 9th street. punk/americana type stuff. and a dj after. cheap tecate. dude, i'm still sad about that burrito hahaha :P  Bengals vs. Eagles tonight. At this point you can probably find tickets for less than it costs to get bad seats at a Sixers game. Not true.  Def cheap but sixers tickets are like .75 cents.  But the french fries are $55.00.
