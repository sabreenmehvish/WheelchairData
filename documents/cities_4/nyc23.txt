Wheelchair-bound woman smokes ‘blunt’ on subway, ruckus ensues  Tackling the tough stories over at the Post.   “Everybody on this train, I’m decking that b—h…Word, gangsta.”

What a dick. So it's ok to blaze on the subway now? Just make sure you on a wheelchair. Euthanasia. Death Panels. There is not one reason to keep someone like this as a part of our society.   
 I was not expecting the kid who had a problem with this to look like that.  

I guess I *am* a bad person.  

I figured it was going to be some blonde-haired, heavy-tittied, branch banking management trainee with a coffee in one hand and wearing those stupid, furry, kneehigh snowboots or a big, fat, greasy, white guy with a mustache full of hotdog crumbs. We keep you!
