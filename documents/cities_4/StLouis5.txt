This bike was a wheelchair-bound teenâ€™s only way to get around on her own. Then it was stolen.  Whoever stole that bike is a garbage human being. Whoever laughs at this girls misfortune is also a garbage human being.  [removed] What was funny about that article? I honestly meant lots of love. Didn't mean to come off like I'm laughing.  Stop it I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you, but your post history shows a history of trolling behavior. lol
