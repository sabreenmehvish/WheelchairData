Missing woman with maroon contacts last seen with mystery man in wheelchair  Sounds like a David Lynch movie Wow, really keeping it classy by filming a computer screen of the victim's picture in Adobe versus putting up the graphic... Maybe it was because it was breaking news?  Go RVA!  
Edit: Typos! Update: She's found! >The 51-year-old was last seen with a man in a wheelchair named either "Ernie" or "Chris."

No update on whether the wheelchair was named Ernie or Chris. So many unanswered questions!
