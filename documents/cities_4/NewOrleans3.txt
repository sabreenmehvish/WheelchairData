All hail, wheelchair dancer Jason Homer is a 610 Stomper  Very cool. > All Hail?

Did they make him King of the 610 Stompers? Fucking McCash is an idiot. Good for this guy though and good for the Stompers. And that people, is how you avoid bad press,  But he can't stomp LMFAO and I doubt section 610 at the Superdome is even wheelchair accessible. 

Seriously though, good for him. Always good to see more diversity in these local institutions. I'm glad he put himself out there. It's a brave thing to do.  Really good for the guy and Stompers, but agree McCash is a waste.
