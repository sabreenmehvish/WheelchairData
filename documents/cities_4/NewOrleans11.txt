Can someone refer me to the actual Statues for parking online? I'm not trying to start some French Quarter/Garden District/ Algiers Point parking-space war... I live in the 'burbs where there's geneally plenty of parking to go around. ...But things are starting to get dicey with construction and houses with multiple autos and/or people with way more toys than they have space for.

I'm on the Westbank, Orleans Parish, Fifth District.

What I'd like to find out [and "think" I know from some forgotten source] is:

* If you are not supposed to park within four feet (maybe three?) to either side of a driveway entrance.

I realize that's BS in a lot of areas of the city; laws or not.  But out here in the boonies it seems like it might be more enforceable if it is in fact the law.

I believe I've seen some people post links to or quote statutes on here before...hoping someone can hook me up.

If anyone knows anything specific I'd love to hear. And I'd love to have access to the actual language of the laws.



Thank you. In front of or within three feet of the curb return in a public or private driveway, wheelchair ramp or bicycle ramp unless authorized to do so by the owner or lessee of the property to which the driveway, wheelchair ramp or bicycle ramp leads. Upon registry of a complaint with the parking division of the streets department by the owner or lessee of the property to which the driveway, wheelchair ramp or bicycle ramp leads, any authorization deemed to have been given shall be deemed revoked and upon election of the qualified complainant, parking tickets shall be issued or vehicles towed by the parking division of the streets department or the police department for violating this subsection

Parking within 3 feet of a driveway on either side, only upon a driveway ownerâ€™s request (citation fee - $40) Thank you, very very much. this is more proof we need a flipped car statue.  lol... I wish I could say that, but unfortunately I'm just a terrible speller : ( lol... yeah, thanks for that. I'll only cite the three that remain in place. Thank you; much appreciated.
