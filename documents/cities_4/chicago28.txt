Don't know if this is the correct place, but I have a question about O'hare airport. My grandmother is flying out of O'hare on Tuesday but has to use a walker.  Do they have curb side luggage assistant at the airport?  I just want to make sure she has the help she needs to get her stuff to the terminal. Of course. If you don't see someone at first, walk inside and grab someone. Legally any airline has to help your grandmother during the entire process. From check in to when she gets picked up on the other side. Just find any airline rep. Getting ahold of an airline rep for Alaskan Airlines has proven difficult.  I know some airports will have people stationed at terminals to help out with luggage, I just haven't flown out of O'hare so I didn't know about there.  I did find Travelers Aid Chicago and I'm going to try to give them a call tomorrow.  It sounds like they specialize in this sort of thing. Let me remind you, do not get gram out of the car, and you run into the terminal leaving your vehicle unattended at the curb. was there last night at Alaska's space at Terminal 3. At Door 3J is the outdoor baggage check in. There will be handlers there. Although I was told if you absolutely need a wheelchair you need to call ahead of time and schedule a wheelchair and a guy to push it for you to meet you at the street. Over the phone it could be hard to get a hold of anyone at any airline.  But you can put your grandmother in a cab and send her to the airport and the airline MUST provide any and all assistance to disabled or elderly from point A to B.   Thanks this helps so much!
