It annoys me when it happens but I love watching their frustration  My favorite is when the conductor gets on the intercom to call them out. "No bikes on this train! GTFO!" I was on a Pittsburgh train once during the morning commute and this lady with a gigantic bike decided to push on through and try to get her bike on. And she did. in the process hitting every person in the doorway. this other lady chewed her out big time... she got off on the next stop... hitting all the same people. [deleted] The way BART handles bikes is why I will always take CalTrain, given the choice. The thing I don't get is unless you are going through the tunnel,  why bring your bike on BART?  The streets over Bart are all great for riding. 

And if the tunnel is the issue, there is always bike link.  Here is what the linked Quickmeme image says in case the site goes down or you can't reach it:

[**Why?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/qkme_transcriber/comments/o426k/faq_for_the_qkme_transcriber_bot/) ┊ [More Info](http://www.reddit.com/r/qkme_transcriber/) ┊ AMA: [Bot](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/vxeak/hello_i_am_a_bot_who_posts_transcriptions_of/), [Human](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/12gog9/i_am_the_creator_of_qkme_transcriber_a_definitely/) Am watching 10 different people attempt this after the bay bridge lighting right now.  [deleted] Is that the same announcer who does his own sound effects? He makes some sort of "*bing*" sound before announcements and everyone laughs. I ride BART often and rarely have an issue with bikes (mine or others) or strollers. Also-maybe instead of ripping parents for bringing strollers, you should remember BART is **public** so tough shit.  Gotta have sympathy for the parents. They're just trying to get from place to place and kids require a lot of equipment to move safely.  You must drive to Millbrae, then. I guess you've never actually looked at a BART map. Riding from downtown to Bernal Heights or Glen Park kinda blows. New to San Francisco. Bikes are not allowed on the BART? Or only on specific times/trains? Oh gawdz, one of THOSE kind of idiots.... Fucking douchebag dumbass So get a smaller stroller and maybe look for one that folds up.  I remember strollers used to be maybe 6" x 6" and about 3-4 ft long folded up and weighed about 4 pounds.  Pick up the kid, sit down, and fold that shit up, and keep it by you in the seat area, slide it under the seat, or even in the aisle because it takes so little space.  

Now the strollers people bring on board have 20" pneumatic tires and they're like 5ft long by 2.5 ft wide, weigh around 35 pounds, and take up the whole aisle.  I mean fuck, these things are so obnoxiously bulky that I've seen Muni operators use the wheelchair ramps to get them on board.  These strollers are silar in size to a bike.  I mean my bike is about 6 ft long and the bars are 27 in (1080mm wheelbase and 700mm bars, 700x42 tires so just guesstimating at the dimensions).

I'm not against strollers on public transit, but quid pro quo; you bring a portable stroller not some ultra luxury plush model and I'm happy to share.  The world does not revolve around people just because they have a kid.  They have to compromise too if they want to share.   What makes you think that "public" means huge strollers have to be allowed?  It's entirely possible to transport children without them - perhaps less convenient - but still very possible.  And if convenience were the sole issue there would be no grounds to disallowing bikes. no you don't. My logic is this: during commuting times, if one is putting their bike on one of the crowded cars,  we are talking about the stops near the center of the city.. Powell,  Civic Center and so forth.   Around these stops,  there is descent access to bike lanes.  

I can understand needing to bring a bike onto the train from an outer station towards the Financial District, but I don't understand the people that put a bike on at these stations at rush hours.  so leave your bike home I think it's just during rush hour that they're not allowed [deleted] Maybe I'm confused.  I don't commute on BART, however I have brought a bike on numerous times.  I remain conscientious of fellow travelers, and generally remain standing.  I've found some cars have the specified bike area, but on others it's a wheelchair space.  I've been known to take a seat in one of these areas so the bike is in front of me, and I only take one seat.  I've never experienced running into someone in a wheel chair, but I would give up the space, whether it be a bike space, or a wheelchair space had the situation arose.  
  I don't feel that I have a "right" to be there, however I feel that I have the exact same privilege as someone without a bike.

Does this make me one of "those kind of idiots" and/or a "fucking douchebag dumbass" too?
  You'd prefer carrying a 30lb child in your arms along with enough diapers, wipes, clothes, snacks, and toys as well as anything else you may need for yourself?

Strollers are the best thing ever.  Plus you can strap the kid in and not have to worry about them running off.

However, if you're a dick with your stroller and ramming people, then you lose whatever sympathy I would have afforded you. this man has no kids! BART stays crowded past Civ, usually not easing up until Daly City or Colma (if you're heading out of the city). Plus, it's a bit of a ride from Civ to 16th. What do you expect these people to do if they need to get home during rush hour?  I have no idea why people are downvoting you. I ride my bike from the Financial District to the Sunset and I have the same amount of incline and same distance (5 1/2 to 6 miles). 

Besides that, why on earth would anyone commute from downtown to Glen Park or Bernal Heights on BART... with a bike? What's the bike for? And I'm not being an asshole, I really want to understand the scenario here. 

 Just when it'd actually be useful for you to bring them on the train, they're not allowed.

They are doing a [pilot test](http://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2013/news20130214.aspx) to allow them on during rush hour. [deleted] Question, if you take Bart and go through the sfo station in the last car of a train, do you have to change cars at that station? I ask because trains switch directions at that station so that the last car becomes the first car and vice versa.  No bikes on crowded trains, or during the rush hour trains. Period.

If yer on a crowded train with a bike, screaming about yer "rights" then, yessir, yer one of THOSE idiots... Some of my child-rearing friends use slings/moby wraps when taking their babies/toddlers on public transits. This actually works out quite well, even with 3 kids. I've joined them in the endeavor and it's not that big of a burden but it makes life a lot easier for everyone else. So yes, I say I'd prefer carrying the kid. Strollers are great for other situations, but if you are just riding BART to get from point A to point B and don't need the stroller at the destination then it's not necessary. They chose to have kids.

*shrugs* [deleted] kids are a waste of money and a drain on  your wallet. In deluding myself in trying to think I'd be a great parent, because I wouldn't. BART itself doesn't encompass a very wide network.  If you, for instance, live a few miles from a BART station and work a few miles from a BART station, that's going to add up to a pretty long walk for your commute!  

The bike increases your range and makes a number of commutes feasible that would otherwise have to rely on cars or a bus transfer (and you have to use the word 'rely' pretty liberally when discussing AC transit).

I was in this exact situation in Stuttgart.  If their transit system had policies as restrictive as BART does regarding bikes, I would have been stuck with ~40 min of walking on my daily commute.  The bike made my trip feasible. They will still not be allowed on crowded trains at any time. They're allowed in NYC's at all times.  Not Caltrain. That's a pretty US-centered worldview, don't you think? Everyone has to exit the train when the train changes direction at the terminal stations.  They often even switch out the train operator at that point.
 Ah.  I've never been on BART with our without a bike during rush hour, or commute.  So I don't really know how full they can get. Admittedly I've been on trains with standing room only with a bike, but I've never been on a PACKED one.    

Also, it's a mountain bike, and I don't wear spandex. Does this help? [deleted] Yeah, and while you're at it, why should your tax dollars pay for schools? someone should cut your nuts off then Or just whack it a lot? well, I was right then! [deleted] Exactly [deleted] Depending on the time of day, this is not true at SFO station, because the train continues to Millbrae or San Bruno.  I've personally sat in the train at this station and never had to get off. I think yer good. But I'd have to check my copy of  *"Ms. Grundy's Big Book of What Everyone Else is Doing Wrong"* to be 100% sure.

I think the spandex would actually work in yer favor here... BART=public [deleted] oh wow, so this is turning into an insult thread for other people stating their opinion in an open forum?  The distinction is pretty thin when it comes to BART. And whatever that distinction may be, it doesn't explain why BART can't handle bikes as well as Caltrain does. [deleted] Capacity. Caltrain has cars specifically designed to handle mass amounts of bikes. BART doesn't. Now, BART could create a "bike car" and see how that goes. [deleted] Yes, it's a matter of planning your trains to suit what you want to do with them, not the difference between a commuter train and a subway. So should we just kick out people with motorized wheelchairs and walkers b/c they could use smaller manual chairs or a cane? Your position is quite intolerant.
