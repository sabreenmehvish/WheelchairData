Need a wheelchair for a weekend I've recently broken my ankle and stuck with crutches for a couple more months. I am in shape enough to crutch around during my healing process. However, I will be attending an all day event next weekend where I will need to move around a lot and wish to have a wheelchair to make my life easier. Anyone have any clues where I could rent a wheelchair for a weekend?

Thanks in advanced. Shit ton for sale on craigslist You can rent, relatively cheaply, from some drugstores--I used Buford Road Pharmacy in Bon Air, and I'm sure that most specialty pharmacies have rentals.
