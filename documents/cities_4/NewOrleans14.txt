Who to call about illegal parking (stealing a handicapped spot)? Look folks, I *really* and *truly* do **not** mean to come off as an ass, but I'm handicapped, and all too often, I see people illegally parked in handicapped spots at various stores and what not. I was also in the military (USMC) some years ago, which is, I believe, why I'm such a stickler for things such as honor, discipline, and *especially* not thinking of myself as more important than anyone else. I don't even park in handicapped spots unless I'm having a really bad day (as in severe physical pain), leaving those precious few handicapped spots for those who *actually* need them. Yet, as mentioned above, there are some days on which I, too, actually need to park as close to the entrance as possible. So when someone who feels that they're so important that they can park wherever they please decides to take a spot which others *really do* need, it drives me nuts with frustration. When this happens, who can I call to have the vehicle towed or to have a police officer write them a ticket? I don't want to screw anyone over, but these people who think that they can do whatever they want with absolutely *no regard* for anyone other than themselves, in my opinion, need to be taught a lesson. I feel that having their car towed or having a ticket issued to them would make them think twice about screwing someone else over, at least in the regard of taking a handicapped spot when they have no handicapped license plate or rear view mirror placard. Should I just call a tow truck company? Or should I use the non-emergency line for the sheriff's office? Just to reiterate, I don't think that my needs are more important than any one else's, but there are far too many people who don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. They're so lazy and self-important that they feel that they have the right to park wherever they please. Well, I'd like to enlighten them a little bit, and make it clear to them that laws apply to them the same as they do to everyone else. I'm not trying to change the world. I'm not trying to start some kind of parking awareness movement. It's just that I feel as though the individuals who need those spots, should be able to park in those spots, such as those with wheelchair accessible vehicles like myself, who actually *can't* just park anywhere, since normal parking spots aren't wide enough to deploy a wheelchair ramp. It's impossible. So I'm sorry if I'm coming off as an inconsiderate dick, but I'm not just interested in having them towed just so *I* can park there. I'm also trying to look out for *other* handicapped individuals, such as those who are *permanently confined* to a wheelchair, or *elderly* individuals who really *can't* just walk across a *huge ass Walmart parking lot* like they could when they were in their 20's. I apologize if I seem selfish, but that's honestly not the case. I'm not looking for pity, either. So who would be the appropriate entity to call in these situations? Sorry for the wall of text, and if you haven't noticed, I **absolutely** ***love*** using *italics*, **bold text**, ***and a combination of the two.*** ***I think you should call Parking Enforcement 504-658-8100. You'll need to give them the license plate number and address where the car's parked.*** Ugh. I fucking *hate* those dipshits who are so self important that they think the law doesn't apply to them. Or who feel that they should be able to illegally park wherever they want just because they're incredibly lazy. I was in the Marine Corps as well. I'm not handicapped, but I still refer to those people as disgusting individuals. They lack any trace of honor, self-discipline, and respect for others. They think the whole fucking world revolves around them, and they don't give two shits about anyone but themselves. Fucking disgusting.  You could write up and print out your own "tickets" explaining to them why they are being an asshat, could get sketchy though... To jump on the lazy asshole parking train, the people that park in the motherfucking right lane of Rampart/St. Claude in front of Melvin's/Gene's....just what in the fuck kind of piece of shit does that? I would call the cities non-emergency 3-1-1 number... and explain to them your situation and they'll be able to help you out.... You're not inconsiderate. They are. Call parking enforcement. I think you can also call private tow companies.  That's a shame the thought really has never ever crossed my mind to park in a handicap spot sorry that's been happening to you  You should call my boss, he cra-cra. Seriously, maybe 311 and see if they escalate it to 911. In most jurisdictions, this ticket is $400-600 and police can write it even on private property.  As reasonable and former military as you are, they probably wouldn't mind, either. 
 Let the air out of their tires. That way they are just as inconvenienced as you, and they will have to be towed one way or another. If you really are interested in doing some more pro-active, you should contact JPSO and tell them you are interested in volunteering.  For the last 25 years the JPSO has deputized a group of handicap people and had them go out to write handicap parking violations.  The group is called "The Quad Squad", yes I know it is so very anti-PC, but it is pretty funny to see someone take a citation off a deputy in a wheelchair. ***You'll also want to light the biggest votive candle you can find and pray that something actually is done about it because Parking Enforcement is anything but.***

If OP's talking about Walmart or any other private business, then I'd suggest writing a letter to local management about how you want to give them your money but can't due to parking. If they have police security, then they can inform the cop to better monitor the spots. /u/DirtyToeLicker responding to /u/_PM_MeDirty_Feet_... does anybody else feel like Reddit is participating in performance art today?  They make everyone's lives a living hell, bikes and vehicles alike.  Yeah. They aren't very helpful. Last time I called them about a beehive in the middle of Canal St they said "oh well" and hung up. Paging r/ULPT    
(That's ***Unethical Life Pro Tips*** for those who were wondering)     
      
On a serious note, I love this idea, but the handicapped spots are typically near the entrance of an establishment, so I'd be too scared of getting caught.    
      
However, stabbing the tires with my knife would be much quicker than sitting there with the valve stem cap, slowly bleeding the air from the tires. Hmm... Not gonna lie, that seemed weird to me too. _They make everyone's_

_Lives a living hell, bikes and_

_Vehicles alike._

Where are you moving.?  Canada! Weeee! Weee..awesome... so many cool places in Canada that I want to go... I've only been to Vancouver and Victoria ...in BC.. . Victoria was a super cool small City that I could definitely see myself moving to someday . .. but Toronto looks like a completely awesome amazing City with lots of Art... And of course Montreal... I even think Nova Scotia would be really cool and not very populated...weeeee
