ISO Atl Pride Wheelchair Accessibility Tips Friend hurt her knee and is in a temp wheelchair. Can anyone offer any tips on where to park and most accessible way to enter the parade? The parade stretch is pretty good for sidewalk compliance. As for getting there, I'd honestly recommend MARTA to North Ave, as I don't know how much parking is available with this many people there.
