A thank you to "The guys in Plaid" last night At the concert at Levis Stadium last night,  the 4 of you saw me struggling to get my wife and her wheelchair through the concourse after being misdirected by the Stadium staff.  The crowds were thick and disorganized,  she had been whacked a couple of times, on accident of course,  by people not seeing her.



One of your wives or girlfriends,  saw what was going on, gave you a heads up,  and you and your buddies went shoulder to shoulder,  creating a flying wedge of redneck flesh. The crowds wilted before you and then, when we got seperated, you stopped, reformed the formation and got us to our gate.



I cannot thank you enough, I wish I had seen where you were seated as I sorely wanted to thank you for your assistance.  I looked over the sea of people looking for you but the chances of recognizing you four plaid and blue jean clad guys in a sea of country music fans was simply impossible. 



During the intermission I raised my glass to you and wanted to take the chance that one of you might see this.  If so, I owe you a beer.

 They did good, but you did great by trying to thank them here, MILF_Man. Guys wearing plaid at a bay area event. Pretty sure you just thanked 50% of the stadium attendees.  God, I wish there were more people like them in this world. My fiance is in a wheelchair, and no one ever makes way or is courteous when I'm rolling him around. They just look down at him and continue on their merry way, even if it involves blocking us. What is wrong with people? Naaaa, I am only doing the right thing.



Those guys went out of their way to help some strangers.  In this day and age, that deserves thanks. [removed] LOL.  That was sort of my point. The other night the cops were staking out the Caltrain station looking for a white male in a Giants jacket. Haha, good luck!  [removed] [removed] [removed] That last line made me laugh so hard.
