Reddit Meet-up Contact List If you wanted to contact someone from the meet-up, but didn't get the chance to take down their information because of them leaving/being too shy/whatever, here's the place to find it!  I think the best way to do this would probably say your name and what you looked like, so that we can associate you with your username and send you a message!  Or, if you'd rather put a different way to contact you, that's cool too! :)

I'm Freya, I was the chick in the wheelchair :)  Had a lot of fun meeting you guys over the weekend. Chico's owner reporting in. I'm Alexis, most people identify me by my octopus tattoo. I was taking pictures. We must all be friends. I was that guy that didn't come because I was under the influence of grumpletons. 

See you next time folks. I'm Tim, I was wearing a green shirt and plaid shirt. Don't think I was all the memorable though. I'm the guy that brought Cards Against Humanity on both days, but didn't win very often because it appears the /r/bostonians are more horrible human beings than I am. I was also one of the half dozen or so RIT graduates there. I'm Alex, the guy standing up in the middle of [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/Qm8sC.jpg). You can generally find me at the bi-weekly board game nights, plus the odd /r/BostonSocialClub meetup. I look forward to seeing you all again at future events! =) I'm Chris .... The guy who was wearing the Beets Tour shirt and has the calf tattoo. 
Also one of the RIT grads :p

Had a great time meeting everyone, can't wait till the next event! 

Feel free to message me for contact info. 
 I'm Dave, the guy in the Rockstar Games t-shirt. Also apparently the elder statesman of /r/boston at 27. I'm Matt; Sunday I wore the shirt with "The Internet: All the piracy, none of the scurvy..." and on Saturday I was wearing the Reddit shirt at the picnic. I'm Mike, the guy who totally dodged [this tag](http://i.imgur.com/2jNHj.jpg) in pickle. Now what are the odds on most people being too shy to actually contact others? I'm Sarah, the girl who brought the oreo bars on sunday I'm Fabi√°n. Was wearing a black & white t-shirt with a small MIT thing. Played cards against humanity and went to Meadhall later. I'm Jimmy, the dude in the Montreal Expos shirt. I'm Cello, the one with the black and white striped shirt and the hair on Saturday. No idea how else to describe myself. Haha I'm Seth. The tall kid from Kentucky who was wearing cut-off jorts each day and playing a lot of frisbee... aka [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/EiUXx.jpg) I'm Matt, the owner of [this cuddly looking guy](http://i.imgur.com/lHKuW.jpg). I'm Abbie, the girl from North Carolina.  I'm sad that I missed this. When's the next one? Hilary here, cooper the dog's mom. I'm Eric.  I was wearing the white mesh half marathon shirt Saturday and the "Get Nailed/Economy Hardware" shirt on Sunday. so bummed i missed it, i was out of town. another one again soon?
 I'm Noel, the one who almost ate man-sewer [here](http://i.imgur.com/IyOhX.jpg) wtf I missed the meet-up... :( I'm Jillian?! with purple hair and red dress and Chico was my favorite person there. This brought me way more joy than it should have. AP check your gmail, I sent you that ferret picture Holy shit you have an Enso tattoo. I am getting an enso tattoo. I am from Boston.

High five.  Wow. I was thinking of getting an Enso tattoo as well. Can I ask where you got yours done?? I'm trying to find a good artist. I feel like this pic needs to be titled, 

"Bath Salts" FLASH! shit, a flaw in the plan Which part of NC if you don't mind me asking.  Hey Abbie :-) Brodie says hi! After the 2-mile run and the game of capture the flag I needed that stretch you showed me the next morning for my glutes Rocky Horror [Saturday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/vnezb/rocky_horror_meetup_same_plans_new_coordinator_me/) Another meetup will be sometime next month. Haha ya I love the idea behind the Enso (and the lotus). 

I'm actually super lucky to be able to say that my tattoo was done by Horimyo. He's a world famous Tebori tattoo artist. Tebori tattooing is the traditional hand poked method, no machines etc. He even makes all his own black Sumi ink which was really cool to see.

The Enso has really great meaning to it, please send me pics when you get yours done!  My artist is [Horimyo] (http://tokyofashion.com/horimyo-traditional-japanese-tebori-tattoo-artist/) from Japan. 
He specializes in Tebori tattoos (hand poked, no machines).

Every few years he makes his way to Boston to work on a few clients. 

I definitely isn't the most pain free process, but if you're interested I could give you his contact info. 
http://i.imgur.com/suX5V.jpg I go to school in Boone which is the upper left part of the state in the mountains, but my family is from Gastonia, near Charlotte.  Nice!  Glad I could be a service.  I love that stretch! Family lived in Asheville for a while, and plan on heading back that way in a few years! Great place I have friends who live in Asheville, it is a great place. You get the charm of the south, but since UNC-Asheville is there you avoid the most of the bad southern stereotypes and get a more liberal vibe.  yeh, buncombe county is one of the more well educated counties. I just love that people like [The Tall-bike Riding Nun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5L8oJWv2U) are commonplace.  Yeah North Carolina has interesting places and people you just have to know where to look.
