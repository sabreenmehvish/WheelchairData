Police seek 2 custom tricycles stolen from a 65-year-old woman who needs them to transition from her wheelchair.  Funny I saw a guy just a few days ago riding one tricycle and towing a second one with the front wheel in a storage cage on the back of his seat and I was thinking, 'he probably didn't steal those' since they  were both trikes (but if you have two bicycles everyone things you stole one)

It might have been last Thursday or Friday, but I can't remember anyway
