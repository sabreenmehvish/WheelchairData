Does anyone know the price of a wheelchair rental for summerfest? I recently broke my leg and still want to go to summerfest, but I can't find any info on rental prices at the grounds. Anyone have any info/experience with this? [This article says $7.](http://m.tapmilwaukee.com/summerfest?id=212532521) Thank you!
