Was leaving the DMV in AJ when this guy parked on the on the wheelchair ramp. I hope they didnt let him renew his license.  It's Apache Junction. Be glad he didn't park in the seating area. In fairness those old lines are all over the place.  Considering they didn't give me an eye test when I transferred my license last week (and I have the restriction on my out of state one), I'm a bit worried how anyone can function on the roads out here.  I was at Fry's in Apache Junction yesterday and a car parked where the cart return was....I could barely get the cart in. This is why we need driverless cars There's a handicapped symbol on his plate. This looks legit. Maybe his wife is handicapped? It's a death trap in the winter when the snow birds come in. And he is handicapped. When I moved here they gave me a 25 year license. My god! Where I was from we only had 4 year licenses and could only renew once without needing an eye test. Before or after smashing the cart through the back windshield? Too noided for that.

EDIT: Did this really get downvoted? Wow great sub, just like the city! Or him. mentally? Have moved a few times, so my license has gotten updated to reflect that. But they all have had an expiration date of 04/02/2051, which is my 65th b-day. Lol before. Absolutely. I have MS, but no handicapped symbols because I don't need them (maybe yet). However if I do need it, I may just require it on very bad days. look at his plates
