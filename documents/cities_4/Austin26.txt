Visiting Austin with grandmother who is in a wheelchair. Things to do? Just looking for things that are easier and more enjoyable to do in a wheelchair, thanks!

edit: thanks everyone!  very helpful It's museum day and many local museums are free today. Although it would be cool if you made a small cash donation on your way in or bought something at the gift shop on your way out. Also the lady bird wildflower center is amazing and very handicap accessible as they maintain the walking trails meticulously for strollers and wheelchairs. The boardwalk is wheelchair accessible.  If you want to do more outdoorsy things, the city's parks and rec department publishes a list of ADA trails.   the long centre is pretty good accessibility wise  Tour of the Capitol  This is so sweet hit some sweet jumps The bats are really cool around this time of year.  Just bring lots of water.  Formula One  Barton Springs has a new, ADA accessible wheelchair path from the back entrance off Robert E. Lee Road down to the pool.  You could show her the Springs! Push her off a bridge Came here to make both of these suggestions, but you beat me to it. Have an upvote :) Hey great minds think alike :)
