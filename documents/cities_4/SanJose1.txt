Does anyone have a wheelchair? I am in need of a wheelchair by next week and they are too expensive for me.  


It would be really appreciative if you let me even just borrow it for a week.  



I know this isn't something that gets asked a lot but it would mean a lot! Ha man there was a "free wheelchair" out in encoding of a house in Sunnyvale a week ago but it was quickly gone.
Maybe have a look on craigslist? You can try your luck in the "free stuff" section or try to find a cheap one.  You can often rent them short-term from medical supply stores.  If you need it for an injury, your insurance should cover it (if you have insurance).  Have your doctor write a prescription. The Salvation Army store on Winchester often has them cheaply.  Do you mean an electric one? Regular wheelchairs are pretty affordable.  Don't remember what it cost but saw a light weight portable one in Walgreen's the other day.   ABC medical supply rents them pretty reasonably. I have some crutches in the attic.... The Red Cross has things like that for rent. really, can you give me an estimate.  I only need them for a couple days When I broke my knee last year I think it was around $80/month
