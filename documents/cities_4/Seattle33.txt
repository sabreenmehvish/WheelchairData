Help me think of really actually fun mobility-impaired Seattley adventures My super rad sister is in her mid-twenties and is debilitating ill.  She's not able to walk further than a block or two but she has full use of her upper body (though wheelchairs aren't her thing).  She's energetic and adventurous and awesome but frustrated with her stupid slowly-healing body.  

Can you suggest any super fun, sitting-but-not-biking adventures that are a) in or near Seattle and take a few hours or b) cheap overnights to do something awesome within a 5-hour drive?

Bonus points for things you wouldn't do with your mom and things that are cheap.  here are some things i’ve thought of so far.

short adventures:

* self-directed, Lyft-powered pina colada tour of bars in Seattle

* movie-hopping with backpacks full of snacks

* Drinking while our dogs frolic at Dogwood dog park/bar

* Canoe rentals at UW’s WAC to paddle around the arboretum

* Student discount tickets to ACT & Seattle Rep Theater

* Cooking and art classes/workshops (though these aren’t cheap)

overnight adventures:

* Canoe trip to Baker Lake’s east bank

* Car camping to Ocean Shores/Long Beach for the kite festival

* Victoria Clipper (though this is prohibitively expensive) 
 Find a nice long, scenic ferry ride.  If you are up to that 5 hour drive, I think you can get to the Tsawwassen ferry (BC, Canada). The ride from that point to Victoria was amazing.  I'd take that route to Victoria over the clipper any day, and it might be cheaper.

If that is too ambitious - a more local ferry trip?  Looks like you can use the Anacortes location as as starting point.  Not sure if having to find any lodging to make it a day trip to the San Juans is in your budget.

 hm. I'm trying to think about life before I had a chair...

Free wheelchairs are at SAM, SAFECO Field, and MoPop, if she's willing to suck it up (I, personally, learned to love it)

The greenhouse at Volunteer Park is nice because you can drop her off near the door (or near a bench) while you park. There is a lot to see in there and a bench near the aeleon(sp?) harp. 

Bus/Trolly Tours.

Movie at Cinerama. A lot of fishing charters are capable of having mobility-impaired guests. You could fish bottom fish out of Westport with a boat like the Gold Rush or locally for salmon with All Star Charters. 

Northwest Trek is great as well.  Can she kayak? You could rent a two-person kayak at Agua Verde, or in West Seattle by the ferry terminal I love these ideas!  Seconded. You could  just take the ferry ride as a walk on, from Anacortes to Friday Harbor. Have lunch at one of the rad restaurants that surround the terminal at Friday Harbor, and then come back. It is really inexpensive and a gorgeous ride. My wife and I saw orcas playing when we went a few weeks ago.  Awesome.  I'd never thought to drive up to that ferry.  Thanks!! totally forgot about Northwest Trek!!  I dunno if she's ever fished before... its worth a shot! Thanks. I hadn't thought of the West Seattle kayaks! Thanks.
