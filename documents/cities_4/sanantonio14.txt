Is there a map showing the types areas? Also, places to live? I dont know anything about SA other than I was born there.. (here?) And whats mentioned in that linked thread in this subreddit. Im a disabled vet now and looking to go back to school and start a new career field. I dont know what parts of town to stay away from, the affordable, ultra rich... you get the idea. Im not into military or college areas since thats all I've lived in my whole life. And in my experience, lol the areas around the VA arent too great, unless I'm wheelchair bound and need to live wheelin distance.  This controversial map might help:

 What about places outside of SA?  Perfect, thats exactly what I was looking for. 

Everyone can hate all they want, I look at things in the realist way possible. Not the candy coated lie everyone lives.  I need to live there a year before i can enroll so i dont burn up the last of my gi bill with out of state tuition costs Wish I did you sound cool When you do start, will you go to a community college first or would you go straight to UTSA or Texas A&M San Antonio?

Are you going to work during this year? What area? Might be good to look near there?

Depending upon what you want and are looking for, you can find something matching or near matching basically all over town.

I think there are few areas of town that are actually unsafe.

What kind of things would you like to live close to? Parks? Lots of good places to eat? Shopping? Nightlife?
