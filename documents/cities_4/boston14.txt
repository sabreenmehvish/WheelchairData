Suggestions for seeing Tall Ships with friend who is in a wheelchair A good friend is recovering from surgery (1 year recovery time expected) and can't really get around without a wheelchair yet.  

She'd love to see the tall ships, but any place that's crowded is going to be little more than an opportunity for her to see other people's butts as they stand in front of her.

Anyone know of an option?  I'm more than happy to pay a bit if it's a bar or something that'll have a view.

Thanks in advance Usually the water taxi companies do tours by boat, which is one of the better ways to see the tall ships anyhow, presuming she's mobile enough to feel comfortable on the water.  Just saw something about the ICA - they have panoramic windows looking at the water.  If she can get to the back side of castle island the views are amazing and the whole circumference is wheelchair accessible  Deer Island will be open and you can take the blue line to the 712 and it is all totally accessible. They will even have accessible facilities.  I totally understand. Hit up Winthrop's Facebook page they might be able to help.  I'll have to see how she feels about that.  It's a good idea tho', thanks! Not bad.  Will check ticket prices  Great view from the ICA  Won't it be a mob scene? My main concern is still that a mob scene will basically make it impossible for her to get a view.  Accessibility is important, of course, but it won't help if the whole area is crammed with people who stand in front of her acting oblivious. Normal Buses are shut down.

It will not be going to Deer Island. boston harbor cruises runs ferry tours, ferries will all be wheelchair accessible and friendly Do you belong to the library? May be able to get discounts. And I think it might be free after 5 the night it's open late but that may be incorrect.  Yes Deer Island is a bad idea.

Traffic is stopped at Shirley St, about three miles from the viewing area, so you cant drive. Normal Busses have all been canceled, so Winthrop is running shuttles to Deer Island from Winthrop Center, but I heard its only school busses, not MBTA. That means handicapped access might be an issue. If you are really interested, I can call a guy I know and get 100% correct info. 

ANd even if you get a shuttle out to Deer Island, get through all the security, it's a mile and a half out to the viewing area.
