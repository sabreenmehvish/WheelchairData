Bring wheelchair here from New Jersey? Like the title says, is there anyone out there going to or coming from New Jersey that can pick a wheelchair up for me? It actually folds pretty flat and will fit in a trunk or the back of a van.  ignoring that it's a wheelchair, so I'm assuming this is a pressing issue, but I'm going out to Cleveland from NJ in July '19? That is awesome. Thank you. It is unfortunately more pressing than that, but thanks for your help.  I'm guessing Thanksgiving (this year) is also too late? If not I might be able to help. That might be ok. I will keep you posted. Thank you so much.
