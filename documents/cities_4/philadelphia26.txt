Run/walk a 5K on December 1st for a great cause: children with amplified pain syndromes/RND. Kids come in wheelchairs for treatment at CHOP and leave skipping. You need exercise anyway, right?   If you can't do the run you can still donate to this great cause. Go watch the video in the link below to see a teen's self-made video about her journey from a wheelchair to running up the steps of the art museum.
