HELLO PHOENIX!  What should I do while I'm inside you? I'm coming to Phoenix March 16-20 for spring training (GO BREWERS!)


I'm looking for something unique to Phoenix.  I'm also looking for something naturey.  Being from Wisconsin I've never been in the desert.  


I'll be there for St Patti's day so how do you guys do it in Phoenix?


I'm also going with my mom, aunts, and brother.  My brother is in a wheelchair so anything for them to do would be great!

Thanks! disc golf! if you're looking for a glimpse at the desert without the fear of getting lost, i'd suggest going to South Mountain Park. it's actually the largest city park in all of the US, and one of the largest urban parks in North America, at 25.5 sq mi. (ty wikipedia)  it's left pretty natural and in addition to having sceenic hiking trails that lead to some fairly remote spots, it offers a nice veiw of the city at some of the higher elevations.
