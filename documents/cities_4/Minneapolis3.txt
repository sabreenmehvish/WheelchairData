Adaptive skiing? (x-post from r/twincities) I'm a wheelchair user and I'm interested in getting into adaptive skiing this winter. I'll be a beginner - Does anyone have any advice to share? Where is a good place in the area to take lessons? How early in the winter do they usually start? Any tips, positive/negative experiences, etc? Talk to Courage Center, they make have a ski club or tips for you on equipment, ski hills which are most friendly to those using adapting equipment, etc.

Stay warm and have fun!
 Mount Kato has a good program as well if you are up for the drive.  Have fun!! Maybe reach out to the [Loppet Foundation](https://www.loppet.org/) and ask them if they have any information on lessons or if they could point you to an instructor.  This might be the same as the top reply, but I think it would be worth looking into: Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Instituteâ€™s adaptive sports and recreation programs. 

It might be limited to youth (?) but I'm pretty sure they meet at Wirth on Thursdays for several months. 

Good luck finding something! Nordic skiing is a great sport to be involved in!
