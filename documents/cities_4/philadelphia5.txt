Disabled transportation in the Philadelphia area partnered with Uber The Uber I took tonight was meant for disabled people and I felt a little sheepish as I'm capable of walking, but the driver Gee broached the topic. He didn't mention the company he worked with until I asked (it's MV Transit) and they just partnered with Uber last month, been working towards it for a year.


If you know anyone that has issues getting around the city due to disabilities, have them check the Uber app out because apparently there's an option for it now. Gee was polite, professional and the vehicle was very clean.

Edit: Transit not Transportation I believe the service is called Uber WAV. Several of my wheelchair using friends use it and it's worked great.  I have been hoping someone would come up with this idea!  Yep, they got sued because they used to charge move for WAVs. The taxi companies also added a bunch of WAVs you can specifically request if you need one. Iâ€™ve been reluctant to try it as a wheelchair user. Thanks for posting this.
