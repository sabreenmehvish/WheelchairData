Is there anywhere in Vegas do sell a gently/barely used electric wheelchair? My Mom unfortunately passed a week ago, and she has a Quantum electric wheelchair that is fully loaded and barely used. I have it listed on Craigslist, but is there anywhere else here in the Valley that would potentially buy it?  I know a guy that buys them, but he only pays $50 working or not. If you just need to get rid of it shoot me a message and I'll give you his number. He is retired and just likes buying them and fixing the broken ones. Most of them get donated which is why he doesn't pay much.  [deleted] I appreciate the suggestion, but this thing is like a Cadillac of electric wheelchairs. It's all electric and high tech. Thanks again though! I have it listed for $1000 currently on CL. 

If you'd like to PM me your number or email I can send some pics.  http://lasvegas.craigslist.org/hab/4925156857.html 
This one? Indubitably! That third picture looks like Johnny 5 or Wall-E. My business is selling mobility devices. I know that is an expensive chair, but I wouldn't get your hopes up about getting anywhere near that price. This is a high end rehab chair, something that is usually custom ordered and fitted to the patient. This isn't something that is usually purchased second hand. Just thought I would give you some information. Good luck with your sale though!
