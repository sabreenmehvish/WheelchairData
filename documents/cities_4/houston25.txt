Whatever Happened To The Houston Cop Who Teargassed A Group Of Wheelchair Vets Over Barbecue?  If you can shoot a double amputee in a wheelchair *armed* with a ballpoint pen and get away with it...I'm sure teargas is on the acceptable list as well. I just checked to see if he was ever charged. They charged him in March 2012 with a prohibited weapons charge, but the grand jury no-billed him. The grand jury system here is a mess. At least the wheelchair veterans would be more skilled than wheelchair rookies and able to flee.
