Looking for some handicap/wheelchair accessible beaches. I found Folly has a beach mat, Isle of Palms has a pretty good walkway.  Any that I have missed? Thanks. The county park at kiawah Folly has beach wheelchairs. Numbers are limited, so call ahead to make sure they have one.  The county park at the west end of Folly has an amazing beach wheelchair that we've used twice for my aunt. Pretty sure it's free of charge to use. She never would have been able to see her grandkids play at the beach without it. There's a beach access past the washout on Folly Beach that has a small parking lot (handicap accessible) and a ramp. Can't recall the address.  Call who?
