St. Louis Crack Epidemic Claims Another Victim [OC] (Spotted outside SoHa Bar & Grill on Hampton Ave)  That bench did nothing to deserve that...  rocky sucks Brand new here, where's the vote tab?  My favorite bar!  SOHA that is... not that chick's crack.  Although in all honesty I've never drank beer from her crack so maybe I'm being hasty in my judgement. Hawt. At least she is still getting out. 
 I blame hodaks.... but its sooooo good. Wow, oh st. louis, you never cease to amaze me! I see this lady all of the time. she usually is "walking" in her wheelchair down Hampton pulling another wheelchair along side with a bunch of crap in it. [Plus, this.](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/116/253/i_have_the_weirdest_boner_right_now_344.jpg) DAT MASS Fuck yeah. I've been thinking about it for some time, but man, this is really a great moment to just stop and savor how much fun we all have together. Isn't it satsifying when we can all gather round the ol' reddit machine and fat-shame some anonymous person waiting for a bus in St. Louis? To think, I was just just clicking around on news sites and iTunes aimelessly alone, only moments ago, and now, here I am with like-minded chaps (i'm guessing most of you are chaps! I HOPE SO BROS), virtually back-slapping each other like a couple-a war vets over  a shared experience. Only this time we're fat-shaming some person, waiting for a bus, because they had the unbelievable ignorance to leave their apartment, walk to the bus and be in public.

This, guys, is what the internet is for.  LUV U GUYS ... and what did my eyes do to deserve this? No butts about it. I love when i can find people I know on reddit! rocky sucks To the left of the thumbnail image above. Click on one of the Fleur De Lis to upvote or downvote. The friction of those hams against the glass? Hawt indeed. Cheeky. It doesn't matter the persons' weight. If someone's ass crack is sticking out at a bus stop in St. Louis, it's funny and should be on reddit. I'm not laughing because she's fat, I'm laughing because there is a mile and a half of ass crack being presented.

But thanks for assuming things about me based on nothing but your prejudice against redditors. I bet you feel like a big man now (BECAUSE WE ALL MEN HERE. RIGHT CHAPBROS!?!?!)
