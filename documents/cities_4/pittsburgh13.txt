Suggestions for spaces in northeast Pittsburgh or surrounding areas to host panel? I will be hosting a morning panel in early April and am looking for a space to host it. Based on where panel participants will be traveling from, it would be ideal to host it somewhere in a northeastern Pittsburgh neighborhood (e.g., Highland Park) or a surrounding town (e.g., Sharpsburg, Etna). While it is more central Pittsburgh, I might also consider spaces in East Liberty. I am planning and hosting the panel through my one-person business, so I would prefer to rent the space at a low rate or free of charge if possible. Space should also be wheelchair accessible. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Carnegie Library in East Liberty has community rooms that you can reserve for free.

The Union Project in Highland Park might be another good low-cost option.

Thereâ€™s also a VFW in Morningside that rents out their banquet hall. what's it for? Left Field Meeting Space on the North Shore (not East End) is very affordable and also pretty cool.  East Liberty Presbyterian allows rooms to be used and has a few good options. Comfort Inn RIDC Park (412) 963-0600 Probably more expensive but the hotels at RIDC park or Harmar have conference rooms.  Talk to Alloy26 in Nova Place(previously mentioned). Great space. I think Bakery Square might have meeting spaces for rent  - not sure if for such short time, but it is accessible.
