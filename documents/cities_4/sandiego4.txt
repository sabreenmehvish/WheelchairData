Hey guys, do you know if the trolley driver gets out of his cab at stops to help people with disabilities? Or does he just stay in the cab and lower the ramp for people in wheelchairs?  On the older units numbered 2001-2051, they have to exit the cab in order to put down the plate over the stairs on the opposite side of the lift, and to deploy the lift down for the passenger. You'll be able to park your chair between the two front most seats, as these are prioritised for passengers with wheelchairs, or on a platform over the opposite door's stairs, but there is no tie down process required or implemented.

On the newer units, numbered 3001-3008 and 4001-4063, the middle two doors of the car have buttons to deploy the ramp. The seats between the two sets of doors on each end of the car are priority seating for users of wheelchairs or elderly people, and will fold up. The operator does not have to exit the cab for this process. Theres a wheelchair button you (or a kind stranger) can push to lower the ramp. It's located by the green "open door" button. But does the driver have to physically come out and strap the rider in(kind of like what happens on the city bus) No, they don’t come out and do that (at least from what I’ve seen. But I have heard one driver go on the intercom and say ‘someone please help the lady in the wheelchair’ because she couldn’t reach the handicap button to make the ramp come out. No - there's no strapping or tie-downs. If you look at the 4th picture on this page you can see the area where the installed seating folds up to make room for wheelchairs. There's a grab bar but no straps.
