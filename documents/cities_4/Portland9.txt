Does anyone know if there are any ADA playgrounds? That have swings for wheelchairs?  Harperâ€™s Playground in Arbor Lodge Park, or Gateway Park. Coming next year to Couch Park. 

https://harpersplayground.org/pages/our-first-playground-arbor-lodge-park The playground in front of the North Clackamas waterpark has wheelchair accessible jungle gym and slide. Slide is lower and has "pad" for user to slide from WC onto Slide. With assistance I assume Nadaka Nature Park just got one! Like 174th and Glisan.  https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/  has a search feature.

I'm not sure if what you're looking for would fall under "accessible" or "universal access". https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/

You can search by accessible play area. Lents park just did an amazing new redesign of their park! I love it and its a super popular part of the park now.
