Is Echostage handicap accessible? Does anyone know if the venue is handicap accessible (specifically wheelchair)? I know there's an upper level but don't know if that is reserved for VIPs or anything. Yes it is. Last time I was there, there was a guy in a wheelchair jamming out next to me in the thick of the crowd. Upstairs is bottle service, but don't know if they'll allow handicap/wheelchairs up there without having bottles or being on a guest list of some sort. Wouldn't hurt to give them a call. I called once to inquire about bottle service pricing and they were really friendly. It is. I'd recommend calling in advance -- for every venue -- even if it's listed as accessible on their website, unless there are already assigned seats. I hate making phone calls, but it makes a night and day difference with how I'm treated and the availability of the accessible spots. I haven't been to Echostage in my chair in a couple years, but Lincoln, 9:30, Filmore, and a couple others tend to rope off spots with a great view so you're not totally blocked. You can usually get upstairs at most shows, but the roped off bottle service tables are all up against the railing--at least on the sides. I've been to shows where you can get up against the railing along the back of the upper deck.
