Is there a charity that can get my wife a wheelchair? She has two broken ankles. All in the title.  The orthopedist gave her a walker (badly broken right leg, the ankle is just the last straw). I've never been in a goodwill/resale shop and not seen a wheelchair. I saw a wheelchair on Value Village on 10529 Gulf Fwy, Houston, TX 77034 for $24 last week. If you go to a Goodwill and they don't have one, ask at the counter.  The one near my mom kept walkers, canes and wheelchairs in back and gave them away for free. What part of Houston are you in?  Do you belong to a church? They will often loan you one.  Jessie tree If all else fails check in your local pawn shops almost all of the ones I frequent have wheel chairs for a reasonable prices.  Anywhere from $25-$60. Just park in any of the garages of the TMC, there are always wheelchairs just left around.  Return it when you are done. Why does your wife have two broken ankles? Car wreck or rough sex? A little of both? I second Goodwill. best of luck to your wife They’ll also likely loan it to you for free if you promise to bring it back when you no longer need it. Can’t say for all locations but it worked out for a few family members. Thanks Thanks West.  Westchase area Stepped off a curb wrong and broke one ankle, which made her fall on the curb with the opposite leg.  Good times All that trick fucking. I think there is one at the school I work at. Unfortunately I probably can't donate it, but there is an organization, Be AN Angel that may have some at a resale shop. They usually help kids with free ones, but you never know. 

Hope you find one. Wish I could help more. You could check some Facebook groups, under special needs equipment exchange, sometimes families end up with extras... adult size even.
