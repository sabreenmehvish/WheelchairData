Is the lack of 1 train crippling anyone else's weekend commute? Its been 2.5 hours and counting since I left 110th and Broadway on my way to 231st and Broadway. The 1 train is shut down so I had to take 3 different shuttle buses. One of those buses stopped for 25 minutes while the driver argued with passengers because the bus was full but she was trying to get a wheelchair-bound passenger on the bus. There's construction on the Broadway bridge. Help You should have taken the A to 207th and then walked. Don’t take the bus because the bridge is down to 2 lanes with the construction (which is why the 1 isn’t running too) i had to go to 238th today. i just took the 1 to 59th then transferred to the uptown A. took the A to 207th and took the shuttle bus. while yes, it was annoying to go downtown then back uptown. it only took me about an hour. so not too terrible. Hmm, it shouldn't even take that long on regular city buses... It is; I just cancelled/rearranged all my plans this weekend. Last weekend I took uber. It really sucks.  Metro North at the Harlem Station to Marble Hill Station (aka 225 street aka the north side of the Broadway bridge). Walk 5 blocks.  Can you get on a different line? i work from home so no Can we discuss how people don't want to get up for wheelchair passengers anymore??  On more than one occasion ive seen people arguing with the bus driver because they had to move and didn't want to.  Wtf happened to our society?!?!  Should've gone down and taken the express bus to Riverdale.  This is why I like to live outside of Manhattan and have a car for the weekends  get a bike
