Message from Yelp HQ [ 1626542 ] After I posted news footage of two customers of Dirty Blondes Sports Bars in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Getting jumped, sucker punched, choked and stomped on by security.

Hi there,

We're contacting you about your review of Dirty Blondes. Though we understand this business has recently received media attention and that users may have strong opinions, Yelp reviews should be focused on everyday customer experiences with a business; we think this is an important requirement for keeping Yelp a useful site for consumer reviews. While you are welcome to post your comments on Yelp Talk, please note that at this time we will be removing any repostings from you to this business listing.

For your reference this is Case #: 1626542 
 I hate yelp so much everyday customer experiences apparently are only limited to situations where people don't almost die from assualt of restaurant/bar employees... Funny you should mention this. I just read an article on the front page a few days ago.  In summary, it mentions that yelp calls those businesses that have negative reviews and if they buy ads, they will remove negative ads. Especially ones that get as much attention such as yours.

If you or your friends are wondering. Yelp said Dirty Blondes is Wheelchair Accessible: Yes. 3 bouncer will go out of their way to assist your wheelchair needs. Here are some wonderful pictures of two gentlemen. They recently helped. http://www.sun-sentinel.â€¦
 typical BS where more is more crucial and when you pay anything can change. Amazon does the same shit. Dont forget about their google page:

https://plus.google.com/115648850633398686886/about?hl=en&rfmt=s I brought my brother to a Yelp event a couple of weeks ago in Miami at Toro Toro, the second I ever attended. First they let him in and gave him a name tag, then fifteen minutes later the Yelp coordinator Johnny decided he couldn't attend, and instructed his intern to rip my brother's name tag off his chest. 

They lost two Yelpers on that evening, plus the others who were watching and shared their disbelief at how shameful and unprofessional they acted.  Fuck Yelp and their mafia shit.

While I'm at it, fuck everyone who believes in Yelp reviews. Try shit for yourselves, assholes!

/rant A friend of mine that lives near Dirty Blondes says that beatdowns are more common there than Yelp thinks. I sort of understand. Your review should be based on your experience. If you didn't get beaten by two security thugs, why should your review mention it? Yeah, I've been very dubious of Yelp ever since learning that. Which, more than anything, means I have a hard time finding new places to eat. I offer [this counterargument](http://www.buzzfeed.com/sandraeallen/is-yelp-evil-or-just-misunderstood) because I'm tired of people treating Yelp like it's a racket with little to no actual evidence. Aren't you worried that your name is on there along with your real reddit account O.o shit it has alot of karma which shows you are active in it. As long as you have nothing to hide. I've never heard of any shit like that at a Yelp event before.  That's crazy.  Who is the big boss of Miami Yelp now?  I've been unplugged from that whole scene since Maria quit running it years ago. Yelp reviews have been, for the most part, accurate as far as I'm concerned.  But I guess I'm biased, since I'm a Yelper.  I don't give out too many 4 and 5 star ratings, though. This I can confirm. I live within a stones throw, and I've seen much worse than was on the video that is circulating.  Possibly, because some tourist using Yelp to find a good bar to hang out at might not want to take his friends to a bar where fights break out a lot? LOL Two good reasons? http://www.sun-sentinel.com/media/photo/2013-07/76853546.jpg Did you mean to say find new places to get beat? Nah man just makes for a better stories during the meet ups. I'll set up a lawyerinterview and I plead the Fif.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxE_oQBwrdU&feature=player_detailpage   Fellow who goes by the name Johnny T. I don't know his full name.   Yelp is incredibly accurate in most large cities. I've stopped going to places with lower than 4 stars unless the lower reviews are about service (I really don't care if service is bad as long as my food is good, that's for my tip to worry about) and I've never run out of great places to go. No, I go to Blonde for that. Ok.  So he is in charge now.  I was told it was someone else, but I guess Johnny has taken it over full time now. Same here.  When I go to other cities, I always rely on Yelp reviews and haven't been disappointed.  I don't automatically just look at the star rating, though.  I read the reviews, too, which I recommend for anyone using Yelp. If you or your friends are wondering. Yelp said Dirty Blondes is Wheelchair Accessible: Yes. 3 bouncer will go out of their way to assist you in getting into a wheelchair. 
 I agree totally that the actual reviews are important, but I tend to filter out anything below four, or 3.5 if I'm being lenient, before I even start reading reviews. There's often so many places to choose from that it works out great.
