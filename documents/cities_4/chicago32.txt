I guess we have motorized wheelchair lanes now  fucking hipsters, man. I'm pretty sure you can still get a DUI for doing that if you're loaded.  I can't believe this is the first time you've ever seen this! why? does this lady always drive in the middle of the street?! Oh, I don't know anything about this lady, but I've seen many other men and women do this.  Hence my comment.  I'm surprised it's the first time you've even since this type of wheeled phenomenon!
