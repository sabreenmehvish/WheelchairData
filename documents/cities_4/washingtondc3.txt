Man in a wheelchair struck by a car in DC  Driver must have mistaken him for a bicyclist.  It feels like every week some pedestrian is struck by a car. What the heck is happening? The driver fled the scene. Fuck them.

Remember.. vision zero. Thatâ€™s a rough intersection.  Vision Zero be poppin', bodies be droppin' [removed] I feel guilty for laughing. Drivers aren't paying attention. \#visionzero

# #VISIONZERO MOTHER FUCKERS This is a sub for Washington DC you fucking dolt. Go to r/worldnews if you don't want to hear about shit in DC. Ah, pedestrians get killed in every city because of poor city design, and humans speeding around in tons of metal at 30+mph? Wow, i thought only DC was silly enough to cater to people's desires to personally control hunks of metal to get from a to b!  Neither are pedestrians.  

Just because you have the right-of-way doesn't mean you're going to win the argument against a moving vehicle with an inattentive driver. The penalties for negligent driving are also absurdly low.  Maybe it's supposed to describe how much vision DC drivers have? If I knew everyone driving had no vision then I'd be much more cautious crossing the street. [removed] [removed] This. You may have been completely in the right, but you're still dead. Pay attention and cross only when it is safe to do so. It is if the VisionZero initiative is utterly failing while Muriel pats herself on the back.  It's literally news! The people struck have families and friends and neighbors who are also your neighbors. It's pathetic that you've dehumanized your neighbors to be anonymous 'traffic accidents'. In this particular case it was actually a crime at large too. There's at least five reasons this is literally news. Anyways, here's to no one ever needing to report or share anything about you to anyone who might be bothered. Just another sub circle-jerk, buddy. Do you really think people here don't understand that people die all over the world due to being struck by cars? Just because it's a problem everywhere doesn't mean it's not a problem here.  Fuck this enabling nonsense. All this does is tell drivers that the onus is on the pedestrians to change *their* behavior. [removed] [removed] [removed] In a perfect world, everyone would do what they're supposed to. But the world isn't perfect, and there are idiots on both sides. Each side needs to be vigilant of their safety, and yield as necessary even if they have the right of way to ensure continued safety. Except for all of the evidence, maps, and data that exists. 

Traffic fatalities, 2018:
This Year: 29 (~15 of which are pedestrians, bicyclists, and scooter riders)
YTD Last Year: 26
Percent Change: +11.5%

That number is supposed to be *0* by 2024 according to the VisionZero goal. By those numbers, DC's VisionZero initiative is failing.

It's cool if you don't think pedestrian deaths are a big deal. You literally don't understand visionzero.  I know two friends here who were hospitalized by negligent drivers so far. Their drivers stayed and didn't make the news, and my friends were lucky to still be alive, but in any event, what happened mattered to more than just them.

Your projected reality is dark like a black hole that can't see out but is forced to only imagine all revolves around nothing but you. But in fact it's a big old universive that you're just a small part of and can't see. Oh well. Good luck out there, neighbor. Well fight for what matters to us so you can worry about your own shit. Quite a lot of comments for someone who doesn't care though. The city had a special initiative on the issue of traffic deaths, if you don't want to have a conversation about how people not dying in the streets because of cars running them over you can always not click on the thread / post that people dying is not newsworthy.  [removed] [removed] Here you go: Based on incredibly easy to find data. https://imgur.com/a/Py0CRxN

**EDIT**: I forgot to mention DC's VisionZero initiative was announced/launched in 2015.

The zero number/failure connection isn't me. That's literally the point and goal of VisionZero: "Objective: By the year 2024, Washington, DC will reach zero fatalities and serious injuries to travelers of our transportation system, through more effective use of data, education, enforcement, and engineering."

What would be a post that would be worthy of your time on this subreddit, for future consideration? You know the Mayor ran on Zero traffic fatalities right?  That is the stated goal of her administration.  The politics of people not getting killes by cars?

I don't see you yelling about posts regarding loud AC noises in Logan circle but hey thank you for policing this sub and caring about the issues that really matter. [removed] [removed] [removed] It's trending up since the initiative was announced.

Don't give me a pithy dickhead answer about what would appease you on this sub. I would like a legitimate answer, Mr. Give Me Real Data. You know that's the stated goal, and what we're complaining about is the trend has gone in the opposite direction since that became the stated goal.  

You seem like an idiot arguing for the sake of argument because you feel that murdering peds is acceptable.  Im not OP, I have no idea what you're talking about. I didn't "post" anything except wondering when you  became the police of the sub and why you care so much about AC units over people dying.  [removed] [removed] [removed] So daily posts of people asking about why helicopters are flying, or where there are tailors, or which bars a 21-year-old would enjoy are enriching to you--but a society that is concerned about people dying unnecessarily is irrelevant and deserves scorn?

Those seem like some messed up priorities, but whatever. You do you.


 29>26, and this is unacceptable regardless of whether zero is attainable.  We should be having less fatalities, not more.  29 YTD is not acceptable. 

Stop murdering peds please.  Stop driving in DC if you can't.  Now you chose who wins arguments your in as well as police of the sub? Interesting.  If you can't be civil, don't post at all. [removed] [removed] I really hope your license is suspended.   
>> Stop driving in DC if you can't

>Stop walking/biking in DC if you can't avoid hitting cars.

Ok. Troll is obvious at this point. 
 Your argument is just that we shouldn't care about individual deaths or accidents in this sub , even though the city has made it a priority to eliminate this problem. My argument is that you don't get to decide what's important. The downvotes button on the thread is for expressing that opinion, now feel free to troll elsewhere.  [removed] [removed] Right, here's some logic.  Don't kill people.  Peds deaths are bad.  No amount are acceptable.  If you drive a 2 ton killing machine the burden is on you to prevent it from killing people.  You are already lucky you are allowed to operate it period.  Nothing is stopping you from posting the content you want to post. The argument that this sub can only post about one thing is not one I'm making, you seem a bit confused by that.

You also are unable to engage in a civil conversation. I really hope you don't drive around this city because if you lose your calm over the idea of pedestrian deaths being important, I can imagine what that would result in when you're behind the wheel of a car.  Aight cool off. [removed] Aight cool off. Huh is it a right or a privilege? How can you afford to live in DC and mix those two up? Daddy's money? [removed] Those are your words, so, right.
