Looking for a dog wheelchair for a small dog Looking for a wheelchair for my neighbor's dog. Its legs gave out yesterday and is still trying to run around like crazy and doesn't realize her back legs aren't working.

Just trying to help her out by reaching out. Will be making one out of PVC pipe if no luck here.

She's 16lbs, small to medium sized dog.

Thank you for your time [deleted] I know it's not what you're looking for and I'm sorry, but if you or someone else looks to purchase one, this place is wonderful. It was recommended to me by a vet here in Nashville.

Building one is awesome and we tried it, but there are issues to consider like chafing and uneven weight distribution's effect on other joints. 

http://eddieswheels.com/ I used K9 carts https://www.k9carts.com/ for my dog. They were less expensive than others and had the fastest turn around time. We had the cart in a few days vs 2 weeks. Our dog adjusted to the cart immediately.  I know I can buy, trying to see if anyone may have a source first, then cheaper router or building if that fails I appreciate it. I didn't want to come off like "yeah I have Google" sorry about that.
