4th annual /r/ Thanksgiving official signup! Hey everyone!  


For those of you unfamiliar with the tradition, this marks the fourth year my evil super-clone /u/coolhandmarie and I have put aside our super-differences to celebrate the birth of Turkey-Jesus with *you*.  It started off with a couple dozen of us the first year, and has since grown to hundreds of individuals and families coming together to perform the dark ritual known as "potluck."  [Prior thread with further details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3pu0iu/no_thanksgiving_plans_this_year_new_to_town/)


We'll provide kegs - but always need food (and tables and chairs!) **please [RSVP here](http://goo.gl/forms/V8uUyy20R5) if you might come so we can get a rough headcount!** Folks come and go, so no worries about leaving early or arriving late for those shackled to prior, less cool engagements they also have to make.


We move locations each year, and this one we'll be in SW.  Word on the street is there *may indeed be festive explosives again,* but you'll have to come and see for yourself.The address will be posted later per the host's request - we'll blast it out to [RSVPs](http://goo.gl/forms/V8uUyy20R5) and post to Reddit as well. [This is the rough location](https://www.google.com/maps/@45.4597054,-122.6984266,14.75z) for those planning ahead, however.


Again, everyone is welcome - it is a surprisingly diverse crowd that has included a nice mix of families and individuals, to fortune 500 executives through losers like myself.  Please RSVP here if you know you'll be coming!


**Misc details:**

* Address to come; will email RSVPs and post to /r/portland

* 2pm-10pm or later!  Most food generally arrives between 3 and 5 in prior years.

* All food welcome, but help cleaning up and entertainment are also totally legit!

* Tables and Chairs needed badly!

* Turkey-bringers will be worshipped appropriately!

* Dogs: Allowed!  Only non-cooked animal allowed, must be friendly, we reserve the right to politely ask you to remove them if there's issues, etc etc.

* Wheelchair access: Yes!  Probably not ADA compliant, but "accessible."

Again, look forward to seeing folks new and old this year - **[please RSVP](http://goo.gl/forms/V8uUyy20R5) here if you think you'll come!** And if you need kitchen access for this , like your dish needs warmed up, or you need to toast or wash or cut something, I am your lady to contact. Also YES we would like to borrow a table or chairs :) Stepdaughter is at her dads this year so I think myself, the wife, and little one will be coming. I have a few chairs, and may bring a turkey if it's still needed, plus whatever dish the wife wants to make. I also have a bunch of roman candles that never got used if you want those? I'll likely be coming. Anybody from Clackamas willing to carpool? Anyone in Vancouver, WA (salmon creek/hazel dell) that wants to carpool? Don't necessarily want to ride the bus there.  Will I be worshiped if I bring a Cherpumple instead of a turkey, or is it solely turkey that incurs worship?

 DOES ANYONE HAVE A TURKEY FRYER?!?

I've never had a deep fried turkey before and if someone could bring one I could bring a turkey. And maybe Twinkies. 
 With regards to alcohol, will there be any access controls to prevent overt underage consumption?

I wouldnt mind avoiding a "continued to the delinquency" ticket [deleted] [Details thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3u4enx/4th_annual_rportland_thanksgiving_details/) In the section:

> How many guests in addition to you?

You spelled "bringing" incorrectly.

> Put zero if just yourself. Best guess at an accurate number of people you will actually be **brining** - estimate low. It might have been cool to see this before thanksgiving, hope you all had a good time. is there an r/harvestfest ?  I don't believe in celebrating the annihilation of indigenous peoples. Yes, I can bring a couple tables and about 5 chairs. And, since it looks like I'm relatively close, will also have a kitchen available. Roman candles are a go. Totally bring a couple if you'd like. :) Awesome!  Theres usually  carpool thread closer to, as well. > Cherpumple 

Had to Google that.  I suspect worship will be in order. Paging /u/coolhandmarie We can accommodate this. jokes on you, they're eating people.  Brining them just keeps them juicy and moist.  Duh. Haha it was terrible.  You missed nothing! I seriously doubt anybody at this event will be celebrating the annihilation of indigenous peoples.  We all might be happier if you'd keep your insulting insinuations to yourself. What's the most desired item to bring? Is turkey still a hot item? Don't want to bring too much of something when others are lacking. Thanks, I'll keep an eye out for it!  Oh okay. That makes sense. My bad.  [How dare you...](http://i.imgur.com/kkzbuFx.png) People really love "scoopable" items like potato salad, stuffing, pasta salad, etc! Or turkey is still not fully commited, meaning there may not be one coming! Lol "brining." Keeping it. Yaaaaaawn. Alright, I think I will bring one. Someone will have to carve it though! Do you want me to bring you a frozen tukey? It was offered for this event.
