Anybody have a wheelchair? I had major surgery a couple of weeks ago and am getting around ok but get tired easily. I need to borrow a wheelchair for one night (Thursday) and am having difficulty locating one. Any help? Thanks!!  Cannon Pharmacy on South Blvd will rent you one for like $20 a week if you cant find one, fyi Oh, sweet!! I don't live far from there and I can afford that. I didn't want to buy one that I wasn't going to use for a long duration.  We have one at the house. Let me discuss with the wife and see what she says Thanks, I ended up renting one from Cannon.  All good
