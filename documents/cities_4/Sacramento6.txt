Urgent- Please please help me find a stand up machine/wheelchair. My dad has Lou Gehrig's disease and can no longer stand up on his own. I've been helping to lift him but as he gets worse everyday it gets harder and I'm afraidthat any day now I'll be unable to lift him. We are waiting for a wheel chair that will stand him up it it could be another 6 weeks until it comes and we definitely can't wait that long. There are machines that can stand him up but all the local shops would need to order he. - which takes2 or 3 weeks. I've tried Craigslist but they've got nothing. Just throwin this out here in case anyone has one or knows where I could find one. Thank you!! It would probably be simpler to find a very rudimentary "rehab" (very basic, manual) wheelchair and learn to use a transfer board ([how to use] (http://youtu.be/Va9Y6XCpFuk) and [where to buy] (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=node%3D3775521&field-keywords=transfer+board&rh=n%3A3775521%2Ck%3Atransfer+board)) while waiting for the six weeks.  Also, ask your medical provider about a [patient lift (often referred to as a "Hoyer lift")] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_lift).

PM me if you have questions. Very sorry about your dad's illness -- hope you find what you need.  If you have insurance, Apria can set you up with a Hoyer lift. Tell his primary doctor that he can't stand on his own and they should be able to deliver it to your house in a matter of days.  #####&#009;

>A __patient lift__ (__patient hoist__, __jack hoist__, __hydraulic lift__) may be either a __sling lift__ (or __Hoyer Lift__, a brand name) or __sit-to-stand lift__. This is an assistive device that allows [patients](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient) in [hospitals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital) and [nursing homes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home) and those receiving [home health care](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_health_care) to be transferred between a bed and a chair or other similar resting places, using [hydraulic power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics). Sling lifts are used for patients whose mobility is limited. They could be mobile (or floor) lifts or overhead lifts (suspended from ceiling-mounted or overhead tracks).

I think the standing machine would make him feel more empowered.  Got it.  I misunderstood and thought that transferring and mobility were the priority. The transfer board will absolutely help with chair to bed or other types of seated transfers, however.

Feeling empowered is very important.  I hope that you find what you need.  Another resource is [Resources for Independent Living] (http://www.ril-sacramento.org/) â€” they have an Assistive Technology specialist that might be able to help with your search. I'll check this out - thanks :-)
