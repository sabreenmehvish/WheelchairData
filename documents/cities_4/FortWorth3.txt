Looking for some good people to hang out with. New to Ft. Worth Very much like the previous posts, I am new to the area and looking for some good people to hang with. I like being outdoors and staying active. I am here for physical rehabilitation at one of the nations best facilities. Music is my life, as I am an audio engineer. (Studio& live)and you’d be hard pressed to find music that I don’t enjoy. I also love live music and play a little guitar. I am 36 years old although most people say I don’t look or act it. I have 2 dogs and I am staying at a little apartment near an area of town called “white settlement”  .  Although I am in a wheelchair,  the prognosis is that I will be able to walk soon, so I am trying to eat clean, work out and a little 420 here and there helps. What I am looking for are like-minded, positive,good friends to show me around and hang out with. If that sounds like something that you would like to do. By all means, show a little southern hospitality and PM me. Peace.
