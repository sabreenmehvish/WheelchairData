Forgot to go to therapy two days in a row Yesterday I forgot I had therapy and missed it. No big deal, has happened once or twice before, therapist was understanding and booked me for the next day 

Today, I forgot *again.* I'm so mortified. I feel like an utter piece of shit. My therapist is so good and so understanding and usually she sends me a "where were you, are you okay?" message if i miss a session, but not today. 

I know I need to call or email to apologize, but I'm so ashamed. I'm tempted to just stop going to my therapist forever. She's probably so frustrated with me. I don't know how I'll ever show my face again. How could I rebook and have her believe that I will come if I've had two back to back no-shows?

I hate myself right now and don't know what to do.

 This happens to me ALL the time. It’s ironic bc my ADHD makes me forget and my anxiety makes me feel embarrassed about forgetting and hesitate to reach out, but going to therapy is what helps me ‘regulate’ and relieve my anxiety and hence, leave me better prepared to manage my ADHD till the next session. It took me a long time to simply accept it and come to terms with it, but once you do you no longer have that shame holding you back! We’re all human so don’t beat yourself up about it :-) I’m sure our therapists deal with a fair share of us ADHD-ers so they understand. 

That being said, DON’T rely on your brain to remember things bc if you’re anything like me, you won’t. So instead I fully utilize technology to help me. 

Here’s a system that I’ve found works best for me:
-	As soon as I make future plans I put them in Google Cal with three reminders (when to leave, 15 min before and 5 min before)
-	When I see a notif pop up on my phone, I set a timer as a louder and more urgent reminder to leave (otherwise I lose track of time)
-	If I haven’t left by the time the timer goes off, I continuing setting them in intervals of 2 min until I’m out the door
-	I always look at my calendar the night before or in the morning just to gauge how I should plan my time for the day 

Successfully managing ADHD comes down to cultivating habits and developing routines that complement you. Takes a lotta time and patience, so use all the help you can get :)
