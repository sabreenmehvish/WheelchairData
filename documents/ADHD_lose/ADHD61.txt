Hosted a family get together and forgot to take my meds. So my girlfriend and I hosted a family get together today with my mom and younger brothers, now this isn't the first time I've hosted a party and I knew I had to get things together. I had made a cleaning plan and cooking plan with my girlfriend last night so that I wouldn't forget to do anything. 

Well I ended up waking  up late and forgetting to take my meds and only realized it when I couldn't figure out what I should do next after cleaning part of my living room and it was far to late to take them. I ended up not finishing cleaning everything before they showed up and then feeling so out of control that I almost broke down crying. Now normally my girlfriend is here to help if I either forget to take my meds or I can't focus and she will pull me back, but today she had to work for a few hours and wasn't able to be there to be able to do that for me until much later.

It was the first time in a very long time that I felt truly out of control again with no idea of how to stop it. It makes me realize how vital my meds are to my abilities to not only control my emotions but also to focus on the tasks that I need to get done. 

Thanks for letting me ramble about this I'm sorry this happened yesterday. Today will be better. If you're lucky you'll accidentally forget about the whole thing anyhow. 

I know what you're feeling on being too late for meds. The extended release format really force a morning schedule, which for me falls apart on the weekends. I do have some standard meds that last 4 hours and I usually take those in the right amount in the afternoon when I forget the big one in the morning. 

Good luck, it will be alright.
