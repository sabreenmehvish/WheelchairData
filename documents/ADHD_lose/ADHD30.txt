That feeling when you're half an hour into the workday and realize you forgot to take your meds Looks like I'll be taking a 20 minute "coffee break" to walk to the parking garage and take my backup meds. "Huh, weird, I'm really into learning about rabbits today...oh shit did I take my meds?!" Also that moment when you forget that you **did** take your meds and you run the gamble of either taking a double dose or not taking anything. I have lately forgotten to take my meds and also forgetting my hearing aid, my job literally requires me to be able to hear well and be attentive. None of those things are possible without my meds and hearing aid. I have started to put my hearing aid inside the bag I take to work before I go to bed, and also I have a backup medicine inside my bag too.  Fuck! This post made me realize I didn’t either.  I find the main way I notice I haven't taken them is all of a sudden I realize I'm fucking staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarving. It's usually pretty hard for me to realize how unproductive I'm being in the moment but the hunger? Impossible to ignore lol. It’s like getting out to sea and realizing you forgot the fucking sails  That is if you remembered to refill your backup med stash from the last time you forgot. You guys should all check out a [barcode alarm clock](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/5-clever-alarm-apps-to-help-you-start-the-day-right/). I've been using it since I started taking meds. Not only does it get you out of bed in the morning (thus reducing the chance of going back to sleep). Scanning the barcode on your pill bottle will make certain than you take your meds even in your bleary eyed state. Haha you just reminded me.

But at least I'd hyperfocused on something non-urgent but still important at work (: How to remember to take the meds that help you remember to take your meds? I carry a weeks-worth on my EDC bag and some at my desk at work... doesn’t mean I won’t forget, but late is better than not taking it... There is just no way I could forget. I feel like absolute shit in the morning, and continue to feel like shit until the meds kick in.

Am I doing something wrong? ...backup meds. I can't fucking believe I never once thought to keep backup meds at work in case I forget mine. How have I never thought of that, what a great idea. Uh ... I'll see you in the parking garage.

Really. Totally forgot today.

Thanks. Keep a small toiletries bag in your backpack, suitcase, or car. It's so much easier having a spare toothbrush, shower stuff, meds, spare contact lenses and fluid, Band-Aids, contraceptives, headache relief, sunscreen, Tums, antiperspirant. You just don't need to think about what you need if you stay out or go on short trips. Kudos for figuring it out so quick! I made a post here a few days ago about a terrible day and forgetting and appointment and feeling like giving up.. Turns out I forgot my morning meds and I found out at like 10pm... Glad to hear your day might not be ruined after all! I should really bring backups with me too, not that it would have helped me the other day -_-  I opened this thread an hour ago and forgot about it RIP That feeling when a random reddit post reminds you to take your meds.  Down the hatch it goes.  Thank you for saving the rest of my day, kind friend! Oh yes, today. And none left in my bag. Probably the least productive day since I got the job. I have never in my life forgotten to take my meds. Taking my meds is like the high point of my day. Maybe that's a bad thing... This it why I have so many different “stashes” of like one or two pills around my life. It looks super junky, but it’s saved my butt sooooooo many times! I left mine at home along with my wallet... AND I’m 6 miles to empty, my commute home is roughly 30 miles.

HAPPY MONDAY EVERYONE! Or how about forgetting to pick up your meds because you are out of meds. Remembering my meds is a planned part of my daily schedule.  At least you realized so quick, my ass would be leaving work and realize lol I had this about an hour ago, 2.5 hours into my workday. I am training and I kept getting pulled off topic and forgetting what I was talking about. Then I realized I must not have taken my Adderall :/

I'll have to go home over lunch, good thing I live like 5 minutes away, lol. I had the “I’m definitely forgetting something and it’s stressing me out that I can’t remember.” to begin my workday. Then it dawned on me and productivity started immediately after taking them. I sprinted to get my meds after reading this. Thanks!  If I forget to take my meds, I end up with the chronic fatigue and brain fog that used to by my normal. Beginning Ritalin was like putting on glasses and seeing clearly for the first time after. So when I forget, and decent back into the cognitive nearsightedness, it is a horrible feeling. I notice when I’m about 45 minutes into my commute and I can’t keep my eyes open. 
 Or..... Walking to the train, wondering if you took your meds, realizing you probably didn't, walking back home to take them, then running to the train cuz you're now late, and half an hour into class starting to feel shaky and weird cuz GUESS WHAT you took your meds twice. >_> I got one of those little keychain pill canisters and it’s a dang lifesaver - I keep a couple things in there all the time including headache stuff I usually feel that they aren’t there on the way to work. I’m also usually late, and haven’t been smart enough to have backup meds.  This happens to me when I'm in the car, already late to work. There's never enough time to turn around, so I just have to live with knowing I'm gonna have a shitty day.  I keep a few extra pills in my backpack, and I also have a bottle here at work in my desk with \~3 pills. They've both saved my butt more than once! Good for you, though. You systematized a back up plan in case you are forgetful, by keeping back meds in car. That's great. 100% me  You just reminded me to take my meds, thank you Haha I did something similar and took my backup meds half an hour before clock-in at work.  I carry all my meds in my bag. Bag is always with me, because literally 50% of the time I forget to take them before I arrive at work.  That's why I always take my meds in the backpack.  
I forget to take them sometimes, or I might not go home after work.  when this happens, i go home and get the meds.  it's not even worth trying to tough it out and get work done that way.  i'll get like 30 min of work done, unless i have something hands on to do.

i do however, have some emergency meds in my desk just in case, and i take them often.
 "Odd... by this point in my morning, I've typically managed to access my email." Thanks for reminding me!!  lol I did that the other week. I ride my bike to class, so I had to book it home. I took them when my heart rate was through the roof and they hit me like a freight train. I got back to school, out of breath and focused AF This happened to me but it was only 30minutes until my shift ends. So I've been taking my meds since I was 4 (25 now) and at about 15 my parents made it my responsibility to take them on my own. It is so second nature to me that I take my meds before my eyes are even open most mornings. I forget maybe once every couple of months (and thats probably even over exaggerating). There are more times that I THINK I forget that I call my mom in a total panic to have her go check my pill holder and see if I took them. I'm usually wrong that I forgot to take them but the times that I have, I have left work to go and take them or school or turn around from where ever I'm driving to just to go home and take them. Thank you for the reminder holy shit This is why u keep a small pill case on you I'm finding that that is the time that I actually need to take my meds (Adderall XR).  Otherwise, I need to stop for a large dose of caffeine to not be sleepy on my hour-long drive home.  Every time I get a refill I take 1/3 of the pills and put them in a small travel case that doesn't look like a pill bottle and put it in my purse and invariably I forget to take my meds in the morning about a third of the time so it works out pretty well. Shocking how predictably forgettable I am I keep my medication next to my bed with a big sealable water bottle. The first thing I do when I open my eyes in the morning is take it. Added bonus is that I'm already fully geared up by the time I need to get in my car to leave. Oh, I hate that!  Or when I'm almost there and realize it and it's too late to turn back.  In for a long day.   Dang i really need to get back on meds lol It’s pretty easy for me to tell almost immediately after starting work. I’m a ride operator at a major theme park, and part of my job includes monitoring the cameras on-ride to make sure no one is standing. If I’m not on my meds I zone out real quick in like a “shit I know no one stood up but I can’t remember actively monitoring the situation” way  Happened to me today. I wanted to gutturally scream NOOOOOOOOOOO (I work outside and didn’t have backups on me).  the worst feeling of realization ever Are you guys trying to stop hyper focusing, because I need more of that in my life I do this multiple times a week (not with ADHD meds, I'm still jumping through hoops on the road to a diagnosis) but instead, I keep forgetting my "oh fuck, you need to take these or you could have another stroke" meds. I only realise if I sit at my PC at the end of the day and see my pill box sitting there... 

Fun times. It’s even better when you realize that they are still sitting on the counter next to your lunch you forgot.  That feeling when you're half an hour into the workday read this post and realise you forgot to take your meds Honestly, remembering to take my meds is a major problem. Then I go the whole day and get nothing done and wonder wtf happened >_>; I read this in the morning before going to work. Then I realised when I got to work that I'd done just this. 

I've only had meds for about a week and I'm still on a very low dose, so I don't know how effective it is. But wow... today I felt horrible. Is that due to forgetting? 

 I made it through the day.  "I feel a little off today, I wonder If I want to check reddit to see  is it time for lunch yet I hope everything will be ok that news I read this morning still worries me and my friend are goingtoaconcertthisweekendpokemongottacatchemallcantwaittogethomeandplaymegaman11minutesuntillunchitfeelslikeforeversinceivetalkedtosteve

Oh... " I forgot to take mine some 15 years ago... Well, i'm glad I read this post before I left for work today. That's when you quit for the day and try again tomorrow. LOL I have a reminder every morning at 8 and a post it on my wall to not forget It’s sad how dependent all of you are on your medication... there are other ways  "Huh, I've just been refreshing reddit and even reading seems like too much work. OHHHH." 

Sadly even hyperfocus without meds is rare for me. [deleted] I had a sea shanty stuck in my head. Lmao If only I had that much self awareness, I wouldn't waste so much time! I have a cold and my brain is not working, which made it all too easy to not do work today  I have literally poured out the bottle to see if I could tell by counting. If I'm still not sure after counting, I snap a tablet in half and just take it. I figure that it won't do too much damage one way or the other and it's better than having none in me. Medisafe is a really good app for that. I don't work for them or anything, I've just found them really helpful. I literally do this everyday. Mainly when it's my first dose, I can't remember if I took it or not. I usually wait 30mins and see if I improve, if not I take it. It always feels like a gamble  This happens to me FAR too often.  One helpful thing I’ve found to do if it hasn’t already been said is that i put a little timer on my phone of like 4.5-5 hours and whenever it goes off time to take the next dosage! Also helps me realize when I’ve been working too much cause if I’m there long after the second timer goes off well.... This. Someone on here championed the idea of carrying a daily purse. I started doing the same and man, it has made my life soooo much simpler. All I have to remember leaving the house is my purse and it has everything. My phone, backup battery, charging cables, DL/CC, postits, pen, pencil, notepad, pill container (with Rx label), aspirin, bandages, tissues, rubber bands, safety pins.

Just like, everything I need in a pinch. Planning on adding a sewing kit and some sort of like 3oz small water container (was out in the middle of a pumpkin patch when my morning alarm went off, luckily I had a cup of cider). Me too. I took them out of my purse this weekend. Never packed them. Great. lol.  The irony is that the times when I forget my meds is when I’m stressed and distracted, like on days I have midterms. How long between this realization and you actually taking them? Because for me it'd be abother hour or so sometimes.  I don't know if this is ADD or not, but am I the only one who, as soon as hunger hits me it is unbearable and I literally cannot think about anything else other than that I'm hungry? I mean this would be normal if I haven't ate all day but it can even happen like 4 hours after eating, so I can't actually be starving But..... What if I forget to scan the barcode?  Theres the rub. 

Or worse, missing an appointment and falling off the Rx cycle. then without meds I need to call for an appointment, not double schedule myself, remember the appointment, not lose the Rx...etc... ugh Put it by your alarm.  I'm the same way. Same here. There's no way I would forget.  I literally can't function without it.  Me too. Although I've realized some of it has to do with the meds also canceling out the grogginess from my sleeping medicine in the morning.

And just the general fact that I've gotten used to being able to think clearly. When tolerance to meds is higher the threshold for feeling like shit may increase for me so that the effects of my meds is a lot subtler and grows more subjective.  I keep two caps in my wallet in case I ever need them if I need to stay at someone's house for the night or if I just simply forget. I've thought about having to have that awkward "No officer, I promise I have a prescription for these" conversation but it seems so unlikely to actually happen that I'm not too concerned.  I'll bring you a coffee.  Glad to be of help! I relate though... Usually when I wake up my brain remembers how Vyvanse  has been good for my dopamine levels, so I usually never forget to take it. On weekends I’ve found that I’ve been able to get up easier than with no meds. It’s mainly just the motivation of you knowing that you will get a dopamine boost once you take the meds and get out of bed that helps me. Oh I had this moment about a month ago. Had basically sucked fumes to get to work because I didn't have time to stop but when I stopped at the gas station 20 miles from home, I realized I didn't have it.... I thought I was going to have to text my cousin that lives in that area to rescue me but I hadn't talked to her since the last family holiday and no one else was either home or awake. I lucked out and had apparently stashed an extra checkbook in my car and past me was smart enough to keep the previous copy of my license in the glove compartment, so they took the check with no problems! I did struggle to remember to leave that much in the bank account that it's attached to since we never use checks or that account much but it all went through well. Past me screwed me over but past me saved me too lol I hope your conundrum was easily solved! Classic  An alternative would be to ask the pharmacy to dispense in two containers, and put one of those containers in a clutch or something that you can put in your purse.

&#x200B;

Not to freak you out, or scold you, just a heads up about asinine laws; with scheduled drugs, and in some places any drug, carrying them in something they were not dispensed or sold in can get you in some really hot water.

&#x200B;

Here is an example of the laws in Maine.  [https://edfolsomlaw.com/2013/01/illegal-possession-of-your-own-prescription-drugs/](https://edfolsomlaw.com/2013/01/illegal-possession-of-your-own-prescription-drugs/)

&#x200B;

Hope this helps.

&#x200B; I separate my pills into old different prescription containers. I put one container in my drawer at home, locked up in a desk drawer at my desk, and one in my center console of my truck. If I have an extra one I will toss it in my make up bag because at some point everyday I will reach for my make up bag. I’ve come to terms that I’m  a very forgettable person and I always lose things so i try to be prepared Lol when “I need to work today” somehow turns into 10 hours of Stardew Valley ¯\\__(ツ)__/¯ Yep. Totally addicted to focused and productive use of my time.  my issue is i hyperfocus on the wrong thing too often, meds let me know that i'm doing that haha Same. I’m the person who knows random little facts about almost anything.  That's absolutely me, I feel like a real weirdo in college, i'm one of the few people in my class who understands how to read scientific articles. Not because I was trying to show anyone up but because I can't help but repeatedly fall down rabbit holes hahaha  Yup.  That’s me rite there.    This makes me happy. I’m not the only one, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum I have so many extra because of days I’ve either skipped a dose or forgot, so I can’t even do that!  I do this pretty often, actually. Like at least 3 times a month I count them out to make sure I'm on track.  I’ve done this with too many prescriptions to count. Probably should’ve been a red flag of adhd. I’d like to start the proper diagnosis process and really start trying to find the meds that will make everything more bearable.  There's also a pill cap you can get at any drug store with a timer with a clock on it which says the last time you opened the bottle.  I use a little container with several compartments. When taking first dose, I put the rest of the day's dose in one specific empty compartment. It makes it very easy for me. I’m so glad man-purses are all the rage these days. Most sensible thing ever. 

I’m angling for a nice leather one for Xmas.

Note to self: Maintain relationships so there are people around at Xmas. Do you have any reminders to make sure you have your phone in there? I always carry little packs of necessities depending on the day/occasion: meds, sometimes makeup, sometimes writing utensil, sometimes snacks etc. But there always seems to be things I need to remember to pack again every single day, like my phone, or make up, because I use it at home and need it outside it's carry container. 


I do try to get dupes so I always have something packed, like when I finally got a second computer charger, but it can get expensive, and I can't use 2 phones :p  That's a great idea. I'll try it. 

Now I just need to find a bad ass looking purse.  Now, if i could only remember if I closed the garage door. 

This month I am going to install a WiFi camera in the garage so  I can see if its closed or not from my mobile phone..  oh wait, where is my mobile phone.

 Unfortunately I was already at work, soooooooo 8 hours I'm 99% sure it is indirectly related. The problem is because we have such shit control over our impulses you can't drown out being hungry. I used to always be given shit, even when very young, for being grumpy/angry when hungry. When I was hungry it would be a constant YOURE HUNGRY EAT HUNGRY IDIOT FIND FOOD GO GET FOOD FOODFOOODOFOOFOFOFOFOOFFOOF. Just never ending, couldn't do anything until I ate. 

I know most of these medications act as an appetite suppressant but I don't think that has anything to do with it. The thing is even when taking my meds I still get hungry and I still have no problem eating. Instead of that constant screaming hunger though I get hungry, realize I'm hungry and then say oh let me finish this, an hour later I'll remember 'Oh I was hungry, let me eat something'.  This is why I switched to a keto diet. I think it can be related but not necessarily. Eating is another source of stimulation that your brain can go after if you have adhd or other issues. 

I get like infinite appetite off medication... Like i'll eat until my stomach physically hurts, and I'll still be thinking about food.  You'll have to deal with an alarm going off continously 😏 Like, I can barely drive without mine. Before I was diagnosed, I had been in several car accidents.  Hmm, weird. I just started so my tolerance is quite there yet. Still feel like crap, lol. Hope it doesnt get worse. Thanks. Two more hours here. I'd better get off reddit.

I made sure the kid took his meds this morning. That's got to count for something. :) Yeah, I actually use my Adderall to help me wake up, so it's kind of hard for me to forget to take it, because I can't wake up easily without it :/ Idk why but meds have never worked for me. They put me on a bad mood and don't make me want to do anything. Then when they wear off I'm worse off than before.  Indeed. I told a friend it’s a bit like a super power when the meds are in play. You have to direct the “power beam” at the right target. Yuppp. I’m a programmer, and I find it easy to dive into interesting code and hyper focus.

It sounds like a match made in heaven until you find yourself neck deep in a Chrome extension you’ve been building that has nothing to do with the work you were supposed to be doing for the last two hours. Now I know I’m not the only one who refers to it as falling down that rabbit hole. I love this sub and how relatable it always is.  Yeah, I've spent hours combing through research papers, clicking through biochem lectures on YouTube, drawing Lewis structures for every step of a reaction, etc. Then I take a test and it's like "What are the building blocks of a protein?" or "What are the main products of the Krebs cycle?" because I'm only in Bio-111 lol.

Oh well...it's a huge time-waster, but I feel like I need to go deep to really understand and retain things. HOW? WHY? I can't just memorize a fact if I don't get *why* it's a fact. It's such a unique skill to be able to read those articles. Most of the time my professors told us to just read the abstract and discussion/conclusions unless we were to know the actual protocol, but I tended to get way too far into the minutiae and understood it just a wee bit better than a good portion of my classmates
 You need a daily pill organizer.  The only problem is organizing them at the beginning of the month.  Fortunately, my gf likes to organize my pills. I've never been able to come to a concrete conclusion by doing it, but I still do it...lol I feel better knowing I'm not the only one. I used to use a pill minder app, but I always convince myself that I've got a handle on it. I would absolutely recommend that you do it. You can start by making an appointment with a psychologist. If you have insurance, most insurance websites will show you providers in your network and you can pick one who specializes in ADD/ADHD. If they think it's warranted, they can refer you to a doctor to prescribe the medicine.   Man purses were always a thing.  We just called them briefcases.  I'd like a nice leather one for formal occasions. I have a wedding to go to next month, but I'll probably just put everything in my suit jacket or just leave everything in the car. Why not a bum bag? So far I leave my phone in my purse. My wife has mentioned the oddity that I carry it around the house, but so far it works.

But even unmedicated I rarely forget my phone, since I use it so much. Now that I don't use it as much (it's not a tool to fight off boredom, especially with a toddler and a newborn in the house) I would probably forget it if I don't have it in my purse if I was unmedicated.

I guess my solution is just carry your purse in the house as well. I have an Eddie Bauer "fannypack" but it can *convert* into a shoulder carrying bag... and I'm not super macho to the point of dressing up the word "purse". So I suppose the biggest benefit would be the ability to strap it to my waist instead of carrying it over the shoulder. Plus it's pretty small.

https://i.imgur.com/jbtLMqF.jpg Herschel Supply Co. makes a really nice fanny pack thing that a lot of guys/tomboys sling across their back like a crossbody. It looks really cute and casual! I know Herschel is more on the expensive side but they do last forever. I’m sure you could find a cheaper alternative too! https://i.imgur.com/jbtLMqF.jpg

Eddie Bauer doesn't seem to make this one anymore. I have had it for years, but only used it traveling. Phone is easy. Just get those Tile BT things or a smartwatch. :(  I know this feel That's me unmedicated. "Oh, I'm hungry, I'll get to a stopping point and eat." \*2 hours later\* "Oh, I'm hungry, I'll get to a stopping point and eat." \*2 more hours later\* "Why do I have a headache- oh I need to go eat right now." That makes sense, and that is completely me when I'm hungry too, good to know I'm not alone on that one

Thanks for your reply  Sounds like you need a different medication, I know when I was on instant release of Adderall I felt that way, but extended has definitely improved my life, I'm aiming for Vyvanse or Ritalin next  How you feel on medication is dependent not only on the medication but also your personal genetic makeup and environment. Not everyone responds to every medication.

I personally didn't respond well to ritalin/adderall/vyvanse. But there are other treatments, such as bupropion, strattera, clonidine, guanafacine, and others. Find a psych who will support this search for the right meds My doctor says meds only work for about 80% of the people with adhd.  There is a ($300, not covered by insurance) genetic test to narrow down which meds could work better for you instead of trying many different ones and seeing if they work.   Have you tried something different? Adderall makes me extremely irritable after about one month of taking it. I've never been that angry before but it would make me get angry at the smallest things and would take a large amount of will power to not start breaking shit.  Whoa, I have to deep-dive to remember things too. If I don't, I don't have a scaffolding to put the more surface things on, they're not connected to anything, so I forget them.  I'm the same way with memorising, works with anything. Logic is the king in my mind  Oh my god...thank you. Your last line is totally me. I can’t memorize anything or wrap my head around something if I don’t understand WHY When my mom got cancer I learned everything that I could get my hands on about it. All the terms types and treatments. I read so many medical journals and I worked as an A/V tech at UBC in the IRC... I'm more up to date on oncology then my mom's oncologist. Sometimes It gets overwhelming my need to learn everything.  Seriously, this is a game changer!! If you're on the fence, just do it. I broke down and converted, and it just provides so much peace of mind. Red flag! I’ve had a few crazy girlfriends.  We still call them briefcases, except no one uses them.

We use man purses, which are; generally soft, not full of right angles, generally don’t have a carrying handle, have room for documents and a laptop but also things  like water bottles, and are carried with a shoulder strap. 

Same thing, just not. 


 Thanks so much for taking the time to reply AND post a photo!! That is actually smart and I do have a small fanny pack, maybe I should keep stuff in there at all times as I can carry it on its own but also throw it in my backpack for the day. Thanks so much for the tip! I have this problem too.  Part of me wondered if it was emotional eating or like stress eating, so I've been trying to practice some cognitive behavior stuff.  The for sure way I'm to get rid of that hunger feeling (aside from meds), is by going without food, like basically starving, and once that hunger pang is gone, I no longer think about food :/  not the healthiest way, I know.  It's good to know other people have this.  I used to feel really alone and psycho for thinking like that. :( I have only tried dexedrine and vyvanse but it's facinating how different they are. Dexedrine is harsh and almost unpleasant  and mostly makes me either jittery or does nothing while vyvanse is a bit slow to work but is much more smooth, consistent and works really well for focus.  I've taken every medication known to the medical world. Like actually though.  Yeah I tried Concerta for a few weeks and almost killed my girlfriend. Switch your meds. Makes a HUUUUGE difference. I'm now med 'free' but I was on Vyvanse after Concerta and it was a world of difference. To preface, I work as a medical secretary for a psychiatrist. From what I've read, heard, and discussed with doctors, you shouldn't pay anybody to get a genetic test for pharmacological purposes right now, at least not for psychiatry. They're basically useless because they're still very vague and they don't provide much useful information to the doctor at all. I think that there's just one recent study, funded by the main company that does them, that showed that patients may save money by doing a GeneSight test (because of less doctor visits or something), but I honestly believe that that study is inflated somehow. We had the pamphlets out for a bit and a few patients who were treatment-resistant decided to get them... and like I said, they're useless. It didn't help for any of the patients that had them done. All it shows is what drugs are "more likely" and "less likely" to have "gene-drug interactions" with your genes - apparently this means that having certain gene markers make you less likely to be able to metabolize certain drugs as opposed to others. The way the report is laid out is incredibly hard to read and they don't really provide a lot of background information in it on what they're actually doing. Even the doctor had a hard time deciphering it.
 
As an example/cautionary tale, just a few months ago, there was a new ADHD patient who had already gotten their genesight profile done by another doctor before they came to us. The patient believed in it wholeheartedly, because the report does seem pretty legit if you don't really know what you're looking at. The doctor tried to prescribe whatever had the "least interaction" with the patient's genes and basically, it didn't work at all for them - made them jittery etc. (I think it was ritalin, which he never uses as a first-line treatment, but he wanted to make the patient feel more comfortable so he told her he would go with it just to humor her). The patient came back and the doctor tried what he usually prescribes as a first-line (Adderall), which was listed as a "significant gene-drug interaction" (meaning it should have been less likely to work and more likely to have side effects, I know it's dumb/confusing). They came back a couple of weeks later and the Adderall was amazing for them, they had their life back after years of coping with ADHD unmedicated. No thanks to Genesight.

I'm not really sure how accurate the tests are, but that really shouldn't matter at this point. My point is, anything that limits your treatment options unnecessarily, especially some new technology that sounds too good to be true, should be used with great caution. In the worst case scenario, you're setting yourself up to fail because the fact that it's on the report alone might make you anxious enough to actually have an interaction even if it may have worked before (I've seriously seen this happen as well, psychiatric patients can be really hypochondriatic). Best case scenario, your doctor will pick a med that works for you on the first try because it was listed as "no significant interaction," which may save you trying a couple of different meds to find the one that works... but also might do the opposite.

It might be useful for some people, but psychiatric meds are already such a crapshoot there's no way that a few gene markers can tell anybody what's better or worse for a patient. $300 is relatively inexpensive when it comes to medical tests, and something that could tell a doctor what drugs are better/worse would be a fucking revolutionary discovery. If it were actually useful and widely applicable, it would be so much more widespread by now (it's been out for at least a year). *If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.*

Sorry I rambled a lot, I just hate to see people wasting $300 to give their genetic data to a company and get nothing useful in return. **TL;DR don't get a genetic test to know what drugs to take, they're not worth it yet.** I could be wrong but I think you can do the same thing with 23 and me I belive and for half the price. Worth looking into. I think they can tell you certain aspects of liver enzymes that will help doctors know which medications might or might not work I'm thinking of taking that test.  [deleted] 🙁

I hope your mom's treatment leads to remission! Lol...  I’ve had more than a few.
This one is harmless. Curious, but why is this a red flag? Manpursen’t I recently started carrying something too small for even an iPad, and it's fantastic. I proudly refer to it as my purse and have no shame about it. I highly recommend getting over the archaic mindset that keeps you from owning an honest to god purse and give it a try. It's extremely freeing to have nothing in your pockets without lugging around a bag big enough for a laptop. Wow its funny you say that, I've only recently started to do the same thing. I worked out if I let that extreme hunger pang pass and try to distract myself from it (very hard to do) then it's alot easier to deal with and I eat when I can/should I was on instant release Ritalin for years and thought I was just a lost cause until I changed doctors. I was put on Vyvanse and man, what a difference! It's so weird how different people are suited to different meds. Unless the stars align perfectly (or god knows what else) Dexedrine makes me withdrawn and cranky af. Still productive though. I have 5 mg boosters for long days at the office but I actively resist taking them unless the situation is DIRE. it's possible that you may not have ADHD, or if you do it's from atypical circumstances.  it's very unusual for medication to simply not be viable for treatment of ADHD since there's basically a 100% success rate attached Medication is not a cure for ADHD either. It isn't going to change your habits or make things that were never reinforcing suddenly reinforcing. I am sorry if I am making suggestions you are very familiar with, but I would recommend some behavioral interventions or maybe CBT on top of whatever medication you might have tried that you thought was the "best".

Also, stims won't necessarily help other things as much as ADHD that could be comorbid with ADHD, like depressive symptoms. CBT can also help with that.

I only say this because I have had a similar feeling with meds. Like there was certainly an effect, but it didn't reverse my symptoms. That took concerted, long term effort. The commitment to change is what actually makes you better, the meds just help you actually stay committed to the change, at least in my experience. I hate everyone when I'm on concerta. Sure, I can focus on things, but god forbid anyone around me tries to pull me out of that focus. It's horrible to be so irritable with people around you :( I’ve heard good things about the test for other mental illnesses - a social worker I know was raving about its success with some of her clients. In your opinion, would they be flukes, or is the issue mostly with ADHD? I’m exactly the same way! I have to have a clear understanding of the structure of a subject and how everything fits together, and once I have that I’m golden.

For me I think it comes from having a bad memory. I can’t remember rote facts (or as a programmer, language-specific syntax), but if I **understand** how something works, I don’t need to know those things because I can extrapolate very quickly. Oh my god - you /u/trash_baby_666, and /u/recoveringcultist, and /u/alyraptor have totally got it spot on - I love this!    
  
I can remember things better when I know *why* it works the way it does but also I find this applies to other areas of my life too.  
  
In my past relationships, when someone has done or said something that hurt me I find their response is usually to just say 'Sorry'.   
  
Even though I appreciate the apology, and I know it's unfair to drag something out after someone's said sorry, it usually isn't enough to make me feel better.  
  
I need to know *why* they said or did that thing before I can fully process it and move on from it.   
  
I actually care way more about the reason why something happened than the word 'sorry'. I can't do much with a word, but if I know why something bad happened I can try to stop it happening again. :( It has actually. Twice! I helped her put together a protocol that has worked for her twice now. Thank you for your kind words.  I don't necessarily agree but probably about being too involved and controlling and easily able to steal a sought after and addictive medication. I've seen posts about a mom stealing meds and an ex girlfriend I think It was just a joke, but if I was being serious: 

* If she enjoys handling your pills might mean she enjoys having control over your life and what is going into your body. (kind of weird)
* She could easily switch up your pills and make you take something without you noticing.
* She could be stealing your medication if you aren't keeping track of it.

That all sounds super paranoid I know, but that is why it's a joke. You do you, Boo. Own that shit! Yes! I had the same experience as you.  
  
Ritalin and the extended versions of it like Concerta just made me so jittery and anxious, sometimes I'd have to sit in the toilet at work just for quiet space to think.  
  
On Vyvanse, I feel happier and more mellow when it kicks in. It's like, yes I feel more energetic and buzzed, but I also have a more zen feeling in my heart which is nice.   
  
One of my friends who tried both too described it as:  
 
> "Ritalin makes me do work because it's urgent and needs doing.  
> Vyvanse makes me do work because I'm happy to do it."  
  
Both do the job for him, but he prefers ritalin because he prefers to feel that urge to do work. He says on Vyvanse it's too easy to want to listen to music because it sounds nicer :)
  
  i do the same with adderall, and it does the exact same thing for me. it sucks to actually have to take them, but i do it for homework or otherwise nothing would ever get done  I don't really think that's the case. 

The thing is everyone around me thinks I have it. And it runs in my family. So odds are I have it. 

Also I've been tested with like brain scans and shit when I was younger. They all came up as me having it.  Yea I've been to a councillor for adhd. I'm looking for a therapist right now. Also all the meds I've taken just take away my inhibitions. I don't want to do anything. As to CBT I've never heard of it.  Coming down it was like *beast mode* had been actived. Man I was ripe for anger I'm not sure honestly but I would be inclined to say that a social worker may not have the same level of intimacy with the tests as a psychiatrist, so maybe the patients just think they're great and they tell that to their social worker. [deleted] It was a joke, but basically everything you said was what I meant. But also, the ability to switch up what kind of medication you  swallow if aren't paying close attention. Yeah, even if you're not paranoid about it, even if your gf is amazing, why run the risk of having any of these thoughts running around in your head? This is exactly my "two kinds (or more) of people" thing. 

On Ritalin I was constantly needing to find some other thing to do to fill my time because I felt like if I stopped doing things, something awful would happen. It was the worst anxiety I've ever felt. It also fed my eating disorder to a horrifying degree. Vyvanse, while it also blunts my hunger, doesn't make me feel like the world will end if I stop for lunch. 

Ritalin also gave me this weird "so many things to do omg I don't know where to start better curl up in a ball and vibrate" thing once in a while that I'm not sure is productive. That was what I told my doctor when I begged for a different med... Lol Good point. Thanks, with the fever of genetic testing, it’s hard to tell what their actual success is. Is it weird to say that I don't know? That's such a perfect way to describe how I felt on ritalin too. It was this horrible nervous energy. But then I'd sort of crumble under it all and end up doing nothing.  
   
Just sweaty but cold hands and feet, and snapping at anyone who interrupted me even though I wasn't doing anything important
