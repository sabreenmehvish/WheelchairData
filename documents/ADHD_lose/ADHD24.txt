I forgot that I left my car for two days in a staff parking spot and now I have two parking tickets. I don't even know how it's possible. I doubt it's even believable. I forget stuff all the time. I lose so many things because I forget to take them with me.

Does anyone else feel like they're always forgetful because of ADHD. Parking tickets.  Itâ€™s like ADHD tax Are you on medication or being treated in some way? I feel like this is a level of forgetfulness that can impact your life really negatively. If you're not being treated, it may be helpful for you to seek treatment. I recently lost a white coat I burrowed from a friend, finally worked up the guts to tell him, then found it again hanging on a damn tree on my way to uni. Must've lost it while riding my bike, no idea how or why I didnt missed it once I arrived at uni. Told my friend about, we were both relieved. Then I lost it again. No idea where, I do not have any recollection of when I had it last. Searched the whole town, it's nowhere to be found, bought him a new one. 
How is it even possible to lose something twice?!
