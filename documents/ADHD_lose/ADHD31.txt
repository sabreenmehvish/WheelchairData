I had to go to the gym, my wife said: take the garbage when you leave home. I took the garbage, and went to the gym, and I forgot to throw the bag. I went through the door, then I looked for the passcard, and the bag full of garbage was still in my hand. All the people staring at me, so awkard. Also I wanted to post this on reddit the moment it happened. Forget about that like 5 times. It was 3 weeks ago. When I was a kid, we used to live in an apartment building and you threw the garbage out down a chute that was on every floor.   My mom had just come back from a trip overseas and said "Can you drop this bag of clothes to so-and-so's apt, and on your way out throw the garbage out too".   You already know where this story is going :)  


You can probably imagine the sheer terror when I realized I was handing over a bag of garbage to my  mom's friend instead of the clothes that had been sent for her from overseas.

&#x200B;

We had to call the building superintendent and took about 30 mins of wading through nasty garbage in the bin to find the clothes I was supposed to deliver.   Ugh. My worst similar moment: When getting dressed one say in college, I told myself, "It's chilly in that building, so don't forget your hoodie." I remembered the hoodie, but forgot to put on my shirt and didn't realize it until I started to take the hoodie off in class! Luckily I realized it before I showed too much.  I have never been diagnosed with ADHD but what you said about forgetting it for 3 weeks is what happens most of the time to me with anything I have to do...  Wait until you go to the gym and just start working out with your sunglasses on like a total psycho haha been there Haha I laughed out loud by reading this! It's amazing what ADHD can make you fucking forget, or not even forget usually - just skip by you for a second lol. 

This reminds me of the time as a kid when I forgot what class I had to go to even though it was almost the end of the year and I've been through the schedule tons of times. I eventually got so confused I had to ask a teacher where I was supposed to be and told her I was dizzy lol  Been there done that
Don‚Äôt beat yourself up
 It's like a free form poem that I actually like.  Yesterday I took a big bag of plastic bags to recycle at the grocery store. Forgot to put it in the receptacle and didn‚Äôt realize till I had things in my cart. I had two kids in a race car cart on a busy Saturday and I was not going to put everything back to recycle the bags. I made room as we went through the store and I even left through the doors by the receptacle but totally forgot again. They‚Äôre now back in the car. This is why my husband usually does it.  I did this a lot when I was younger.
Mom:‚ÄùTake the trash out on the way to school‚Äù
Me, struggling to get the trash bag and me on the car....
Mom goes ‚Äúwhat the heck are you doing!?‚Äù
:shrug: I thought this was a really long setup on r/DadJokes Oh man. That reminds me of my friend. She never walked around with it, but she would forget she threw it in the trunk to take to the dump, and it would sit there in the heat for a few days. Whenever I got in her car, I would be like, ".... you got garbage back there, don't you?" It would always be a "DAMN IT NOT AGAIN" situation bc she would steadily go nose blind to the increasing reek. We eventually got into a cycle where she'd text me she's putting garbage in the trunk, and later that day I'd have an alarm on my phone tell me to remind her haha.  Is that what adhd does sometimes because I‚Äôve def done that before  Well, you technically did what she said XD I understand üòê I love you so much for trying. Don‚Äôt give up.  The opposite happens when I post on reddit: it‚Äôs impulsive and I‚Äôll take to reply and lose track of my day.  I've walked a few times to school in slippers and used to forget my school books at home. I also once forgot to pick up my brother from the kindergarten (I was sure I had forgotten to do something, but couldn't remember what!) 

I always pause and think very hard when stopping by the bins to not to throw away anything that's not rubbish (keys in hand, handbag..). My instinct is to throw away everything I am carrying at that moment. 

Love your story!  I spent $25 on a gram of cannabis oil for medical pain relief and anxiety. 

Then I cleaned off the coffee table

And my meds üò®

Found it in the trash.  Got fast food garbage out of car, walked to recycle bin by the garage, opened, and tossed my car keys in. Walked inside and put the trash on the table. 1 hour later wife asks "Where are the car keys?"
I reply "Check the recycle bin!"
then I WTF'd myself. Hahahahaha. Amazing Don‚Äôt understand this but I assume it‚Äôs the old throw the wrong bag, keep the trash? What do u mean how does it affect ur life? How did you tackle it, and in what other ways could you have tackled it? Discuss why and why not. Can ADD medication make you more forgetful? Or would that be due to an underlying condition?   On a few occasions I would pee at the toilet but forgot to remove my underwear. =/ I don't know if it's my ADD though or just being tired.  At least they were in a bag and not just sitting in garbage I'm like this too: if I'm carrying around two things, and one has to be thrown away, I'll always toss the wrong one. Always. I once inadvertantly threw away my medication in a similar situations. I spent a few hours questioning if I had taken it or in fact thrown it away. After 3 hours of over focusing on this conundrum, I knew I had thrown it away.  go to see a psy if you think you have it, it envolves a LOT of things, most of the mortals have normal distractions, or forget things, it doesn't mean they have add You mean like a badass! which class? struggling remembering ''new'' names at end of the year, or which month we are?! or people sometimes getting mad at me because I didnt remember their birthdays, WHILE I CANT REMEMBER MINE! well the list goes... I actually laugh and find kinda cute this things =P Haah this is so much my life I just sat her laughing until I teared up. Sadly I‚Äôm 45 now and it‚Äôs still a problem.  I need friends like you haha Yes, this is mandatory for ADHD Haha, that's what I'm doing right now... Love how here we all have more than something in common haha! No I think he just forgot he was holding the goddamn garbage bag lol.  I just turned back and threw it in the container in the street, then never said anything. I just laughed :P The underlying condition that makes him forgetful is ADHD I wasn't on meds when this happened. I think it can make you less forgetful, but you are still a human being, everyone forgets something, SOME times.

If meds make you forgetful maybe not the right dose, if it's not a dose issue, find other type of med. Sometimes I found myself fixated on things more when I took meds.. so I would get certain tasks done but be disconnected from a lot of my reality and because of that I wasnt mindful of the people/environment around me as much. idk if any of this makes sense lol. 


I think adhd in my experience is more about trying to do too much at once... I‚Äôll try to bake some cookies in the middle of doing my laundry while watching a tv series and then notice my plants by the windows need to be watered leave my laundry half done by the couch  look outside by the window while I‚Äôm watering my plants and space out on a flock of birds flying by smell my cookies get brought back to reality rush into the kitchen take the cookies out panicking hope they‚Äôre not burnt... ya know  The worst is describing your symptoms and having mortal people "so what, I get distracted by noises too." OMG BUT CAN YOU STILL FUNCTION IF THAT NOISE IS GOING ON?! 

In other words, I agree with op! If you think you have it then get checked out! Haha or how old are you? Ummmm 25. I think? Me too but only once in a while!!! 36 and while I learned the lesson about paying attention to what bag I‚Äôm carrying (because this story was told by my mom to EVERYONE for like a week) I still have the attention span of a goldfish.  Oh well  I‚Äôm ADHD then ahah according to symptoms I don‚Äôt really believe in it tho i think it‚Äôs just my personality I would have just loudly been like ‚Äúwell this isn‚Äôt my passcard‚Äù and laughed at myself  Im 54 and my family has a history of early onset of dementia.   Agree, there is normal-forgetful then there is ADHD forgetful. Nothing compares to ADHD forgetful... like walking into a room with the sole purpose to do a task and then walking straight out again without doing the task. Then repeating this 3 times. Or forgetting what your saying *while* your saying it. It feels like dementia sometimes.  Yep starting ten tasks and finishing none of them. Thinking your cleaning your apartment only to accidentally turn it into a bomb site. I think this is one of the reasons I find it hard to start tasks, because I know starting one thing will result in loads of other things being started and nothing getting done. I feel like giving up before I start because either way nothing gets done.  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt focus on anything I must have ADHD too lol‚Äù 

Bruh it‚Äôs more complicated than that.  I think the biggest factor is how much it impedes life. Everyone is forgetful or gets distracted, but I‚Äôve never heard from an (untreated) ADHDer that says ‚Äúoh yeah, I guess I forget some things here and there, but it‚Äôs not a big problem.‚Äù 

This. Shit. Is. There. All. Of. The. Time. 
 I always seem to be telling people I'm a year younger than I am haha. I just seem to forget.  24 :)  Get some real information, I used to believe this and then I changed my mind.

The diagnosis changed my life, don't wait too long if it is affecting your life :)  I feel like a lot of things I read on here are things people with very bad dissociative personality disorder do.. how do you tell the difference between the two?? I do almost all of these things but have always just thought I was spacey  Wat do u mean how does it affect ur life I don‚Äôt know enough about DPD to answer that lol.  I never been able yo study code, with meds I'm able to sit and study w/e I want, and also enjoy it. I can think clearly and be less impulsive. It changed so many things that were wrong in my life and also understand me better and not punishing me for being "lazy". 

If you are concerned about this check all the info in Google and the dangers of not starting a treatment!

If you are worried enough see a psychiatrist.  *\[Foreword: Isn't life a blast? Never a dull moment - I feel like Todd Chavez from Bojack Horseman (especially with the asexuality too)....\]*

I've just spent the last 1h45 browsing reddit instead of just doing as I intended - almost 2h ago - to take my ritalin, after which I was gonna immediately go and cook myself dinner cos it ~~is~~ was dinner time... ergh

I was also gonna have a little go at practicing flying my new drone too... back when it was still daylight before the sun set like >5 hours ago. Bollocks to that now. Let's try again tomorrow.
