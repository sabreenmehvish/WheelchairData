Did I take my medicine or misplace it? I usually keep my medicine in a single day container so I do not accidentally take too much. I remember taking the medicine out and setting it on the table, but I do not remember taking it. It is not where I though it would be, so I must have taken it right? I hate when I do that. That’s like having to drive around the block because I can’t remember if I closed the garage door. 

Wait an hour... you probably did take it.  Some people have a certain tick or habit that they only have when they take or don’t take their meds. For example, when I take my meds I get insanely picky about everything being clean and I can’t stand to touch dirty dishes. That said, try to see if you have that tick or habit right now and then you can figure out if you took your meds or not. And then neuro typicals tell you to get a box. Yeah, I've got three. Filling them is the problem. I just throw them all over the counter and count them out. 

Did you figure out if you took them?  Good suggestion! It kicked in about half an hour later. Thanks. I realized shortly after that I did take the medicine. I was able to read some instructions I needed to take care of a task. I medicated I have trouble reading anything I am not interested in. Yes I took them. About half an hour after that post I realize I was not doing what I should be doing, then realized that was a medicated thought.
