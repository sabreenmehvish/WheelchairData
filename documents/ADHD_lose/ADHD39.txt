Do you get Lost in thought? Stop breathing? Is this an ADHD experience? I was sitting down yesterday and started thinking about something. The thinking was so strong that I couldn’t see or hear anything for a bit.

When I was a kid I noticed I would sometimes “come up for air” and I remember telling my mom that sometimes I forgot to breath Yep. Probably 3 or 4 times a day usually on the way to work. I'm just glad we can't do the same with a heartbeat.  I frequently forget to breathe when I'm deep in thought, or my breathing is very "manual." Not sure if it's an ADHD thing, but it wouldn't surprise me. Good god I do this all the time  Yes. My breathing can be very irregular. I know the autonomous nervous system controls respiration, but my ADHD overtakes it and I have a tendency to hold my breath, or breathe shallow breaths when i'm frustrated or lost in thought. I'm going to do some more research but it would make sense. I remember when i was young my grandfather pointing this out that I did it and also my dad (undiagnosed) did the same thing. I'll let you know if i find any interesting research.
