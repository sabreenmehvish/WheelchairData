Didnâ€™t take meds, forgot an entire question on a test I hate to take my medicine (60mg of Vyvanse), and chose not to for a myriad of reasons (mostly blood circulation to important areas). Forgot to do an entire problem on a physics test and lost 20% of my grade because of it. Just didnâ€™t even register the question existing, I did a question before and a question after, but skipped right over it. Not really asking for anything just wanted to rant about it saying wow this sucks.  I donâ€™t take my meds before an exam because I tend to over focus on just one of the questions and spend an hour on it and then run out of time to answer the rest ðŸ˜¬ Ohh, that sucks!! So sorry that happened to you! Can you talk to your teacher/ professor about it? 
Small chance they'll help, but they might... I tend to forget big chunks of what I'm doing when I hyperfocus, like an important step of a process. It definitely gets me into trouble sometimes!  Unlucky Been there! Thatâ€™s all I got ðŸ˜­ Ughhhh. Darn that brain! That sounds so frustrating.  Thatâ€™s how I am off of my meds ðŸ¤§ I have done entire projects before then forget to turn them in online ðŸ˜‘
