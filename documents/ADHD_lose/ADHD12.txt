“If it was that important you would remember” *Laughs in ADHD* I forget and/or misplace my phone, keys, chargers, wallet, school assignments, laptop, glasses...etc etc.  ohhHhhHhh that shit pisses me off SO much. I almost missed a court date for a speeding ticket. I lost my nice ass headphones. I had to pull some strings to make up a final once because I showed the day after it was held and showed up to a different one 3 hours early. OBVIOUSLY ID LIKE TO NOT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS  stealing that saying *laughs in ADHD*  Ahhhh this kills me hahaha

About two weeks ago I was under so much pressure that I got shingles on my writing hand three days before my Master's portfolio was due. I was in so much pain I couldn't type, so I got an extension. The following week I was so tired and exhausted that I forgot I had jury duty until my boyfriend texted me reminding me the NIGHT BEFORE I was supposed to show up. He told me he listed my taxes and jury duty in his 'to do' list because he didn't want to see me get taken by the feds because I forgot (said with humor, but case in point: I already forgot to show up to jury duty once this year). He asked me if I write this stuff down in my calendar and I felt so exasperated by that question because I normally do but DID HE NOT JUST SEE ME CRY WITH SHINGLES ON MY HAND FINISHING MY MASTER'S PORTFOLIO THAT WEEKEND? THERE WAS NO MORE SPACE LEFT IN MY BRAIN FOR ANYTHING ELSE. But I love him so much because he reminded me to do my taxes and go to jury duty and I am not in trouble with the law for my forgetfulness. ADHD + Anxiety = Forgetting the stuff you want to remember and remembering the stuff you want to forget

I totally get it, though! I’ve gotten better about it with help from an app, but sometimes, even when you have a planner/app/whatever, you still forget stuff because you forget to put it in your planner/app/whatever! Yeah, my passport is not that important anyways. Had to tie my keys to my purse because they weren’t that important. I am very meticulous with caring for my dog fish and rats. I bought my dog a reflective leash and collar because I enjoy walking him at night. Brought him to my mom's for the weekend. Got to her house and realized I left the leash on top of my car, gone forever lol. God dammit. Joking aside, no phrase will get my blood boiling like that one right there. 

"If it was that important, you'd remember." I know it's important. I know I should remember. People think we do this shit on purpose. I just *love* "pretending" to forget toilet paper for the umpteenth time. I find great *joy* in forgetting my fucking perscription for my birth control. 

I will flip the bird to the next person who says this to me. They don't know how difficult it is to have your brain working against you.  Having my parents tell me "you didn't forget, you just didn't want to do it" was so endlessly infuriating to me as a child. No, I fucking forgot because I forgot. Now that you mention it, I remember when you told me. I was in fact paying attention. Then I forgot. It didn't cross my mind again after that initial moment and maybe I told myself "okay, I will do that when I get home from school" or "after I do this other thing you told me to do" or maybe "after this episode of SpongeBob." I had every intention of doing this thing. I didn't ignore you. I didn't consciously choose to not do it. I forgot. It's a thing that happens to people. Yeah, it's not great. It's not a good excuse. I will now do this thing you told me to do, which I did at some point mean to get done. My apologies. I forgot. I am not lying to you.

Pisses me off when people call me a liar. I make it a point not to lie to people because I was called a liar a lot as a kid when I was in fact telling the truth. Maybe I come across as blunt at times and maybe I could have talked myself out of trouble by lying in some past situations, but I don't regret telling the truth. Even when I want to lie, like when people ask if I am okay, I will still tell them straight-up "no, actually I am not okay." I don't want them to offer to help me or ask me why I am not okay, I kinda just want them to be satisfied I answered their question and leave me alone. Sometimes they will leave me alone but maybe keep an eye on me. Sometimes they will offer words of kindness or sympathy. Sometimes they will try to get me to talk about it but all I have to say is the truth, which is "I will be okay, but talking about it is not helpful for me at the moment. Thank you for caring, though. I will be okay, it may just take me some time and I might need to take a break for a few minutes to get myself together." And that's all that needs to be said. Lying to people has never done me any good. I cannot say that telling the truth always helps me, either, but I at least won't be a liar. 

Sorry for the rant. It just pisses me off when I think about people calling me a liar for telling the truth.

 My mom used to say this to me all the time. Meanwhile I’d forget a sentence halfway through saying it but apparently it wasn’t important enough My dad has ADHD , BAD.  His doctor asked him how he doesn’t lose ALL HIS CRAP. 

Answer? When he gets home from work he puts it ALL in a little basket on the counter. Wallet, keys, glasses. I’ve started doing the same.

But it only works for those 3 things. Then my counter gets cluttered and I lose the basket. Still wondering how he does it ... This is my fucking Spanish teacher right now everytime I go and ask her a question and I hate it SO much

"We learned this material last week. You should remember this"

Every single time she says this, im tired of it!
 One year when I was a young teenager I forgot my dad's birthday (it's June 28th and I thought it was July 28th, for some reason), and my Stepmom screamed at me about it in public for a solid half an hour, saying shit similar to this. I was so traumatized I developed a deep anxiety about making sure I remembered hers and my dad's birthdays, except last year when it got so bad I forgot in the OPPOSITE direction and called him to wish him a happy birthday a day early, lol. He's always been a great sport about it (because he's not a shitty person) but I was so mortified.  reminds me, where are my glasses... Put a hook by your door. No more lost keys :) Took the whole extended family to a fancy restaurant last weekend for a major celebration. One of those rare chances for everyone to get together. Told them I'd be paying for everything. After desserts I found out I forgot my wallet. 

Had to have a colleague to show up with a credit card and save us.  Sent my phone to Israel on accident. Forgot it was there and swept it into a bag with the stuff a guy bought and he went on a plane back home later that day. To Israel. He was nice enough to send it back, but I still do things like that. *laughs in ADHD* More like if it's important I better write it down before I forget about it forever My struggle before understanding/getting diagnosed with ADHD was that I thought “There’s no way I could forget this right here in front of me... I’ll be fine... Normal people don’t lose that...”

Now I *try* to catch myself doing certain things because I accept I’ll lose or forget something. 

It still won’t bring back my passport, high school cell phone, or every leftovers container at a restaurant...  and I will still forget my VERY important birth control I've played tabletop games for 15 years. Finally decided I should get myself a nice set of dice. Took them to two sessions. No idea where they went after that. It is really frustrating. The only way for me to combat it is to develop counter habits. I force myself to put my keys, wallet, glasses etc. in specific spots (on actual hooks and such) as soon as I walk in the door before I do anything else. That way I never have to actually remember where they are and it removes the stress of having to remember/find them. Creating the habit is the hard part but once I did it made my life so much easier. Also, I double check that everything I need is in its spot before I go to bed so when I inevitably wake up late because I  hit snooze 15 times I can get ready in less than 5 mins and be significantly less late for work. (Still working on the waking up on time part.) The other day I was actually really scared because I thought I would get Dementia or Alzheimer’s wayyy sooner than anyone else. Yes, we forget what we want to remember and remember what we want to forget. 

Some days my forgetfulness is so bad, I don’t even know what is going on. I fucking scare myself. It’s been getting so much worse lately too. I’m barely finishing up my first Spring semester at community college and the struggle has gotten so real and intense more than any other year in my life.

Prayers to those with ADD/ADHD.  This was and is still me. In high school, it sucked because early mornings rushing around + ADHD = not great. The amount of times my mom had to bring me things I forgot was far too many.  Dude I forgot to sign an extension on my electric bill and they shut my power off and had to pay the whole bill. I really should get meds again. I can remember every phone number I've ever had but not which is the correct day to put the bins out, or where I put any of my belongings...   "Okay get X, Y, and Z when you go to the store."
  
  "Alright, text it to me."
  
  "Can't you just remember?"
  
  "You forget my secret power is the ability to forget anything." I should say something about my birthday if my brother ever says that to me again My mum would always say this to me when I was a kid.... One time I was at the gym using the lat pull down machine. Well it was uncomfortable because there’s pads that hold your legs down, and my wallet and keys were rubbing against them. So I took them out of my pocket and placed them on the machine, no more than a few inches from my face. I was literally looking right at them. I told myself I wouldn’t forget them because they were in such an obvious place. Guess what I forgot when I moved to another machine? I also get “you can’t even get out of bed on time on your son’s birthday!” Ouch. Gets me in the guts that one. My husband doesn’t understand how hard it is to wake up sometimes. Oh God this pisses me off so much!  My ex-wife would say, "if you loved me, you'd remember x".   That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works.  So freaking insulting and aggravating. ...and then when people you care about take these lapses in memory as a sign that you don't really care about them.  That one is more difficult to deal with than the work/legal forgetfulness.  My wife and (adult) children are very understanding, but I'm not as forgiving to myself.

I can't remember to pick up their prescriptions for 20 minutes, but I can remember the guilt of forgetting forever. *Laughs in ADHD*

I shall steal this and write it down before I totally forget about it With ADHD people I think the correct phrasing would if it was that important would make sure there are checks and balances to remember that shit. I fucking love how were having a full on discussion of linguistics and history in the comments I can also laugh in TBI.  *Multilingual I have all important things in one small bag I always carry with me. I also forget to take it with me a at least a couple of times a week.  I used to do that.  Start putting them in the same place every day when you get home or as soon as you're finished using them.  Consistency is key. Lol right I can't even remember my phone number half the time The more important the more I forget This. This literally ruined one of my relationships, I kept forgetting things so I tried doing this thing where I would log/write it somewhere. And guess what? I'd forget to save it, or lose the paper.

I'm with someone who understands now, so it's a lot easier on us both  Look into getting a tile. They're great. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073QNZPMT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_eFE5AbZ37R567 It's all about making your own reference point and sticking to it no matter what other people consider normal. If I usually misplace 3 things a day and only misplace 1 thing today...I will consider it a win.


If I were to use other people's reference point of only losing some like once a month, I will cause myself so much extra anxiety and frustration trying to reach a standard that is more or less impossible for me. 


It's still super hard to implement this thinking cuz people will always judge you based on their reference point. Trying to find a role in life where your positive value can outweigh your negative traits is a challenge for everyone but is especially hard for ppl with ADHD because our negative symptoms are usually so obvious and idiotic to most people. But I also think that our creative minds and holistic interests/viewpoint could be immensely valuable if in the right environment and roles. Me every month: I’m going to put this prescription somewhere safe so I don’t lose it. When I run out of pills: where the fuck did I put that prescription? Yep, I don't think me catching a serious illness isn't that important so I forget to get for tests. ***BUT I CAN DAMN WELL REMEMBER THAT "ASS" IS ONE OF THE FEW WORDS USED IN MODERN ENGLISH THAT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGES OF BRITAIN***

^(I almost forgot to post this because I got distracted reading about the evolution of language on the British Isles) Hahahaha, wait - why are we all laughing again? *Forgets in ADHD* Forgets it 10 minutes later *laughs in ADHD* All your user names are fantastic by the way Same! Haha! "HAH-...???" That saying is exactly how I justify forgetting stuff  >my taxes and jury duty in his 'to do' list because he didn't want to see me get taken by the feds because I forgot 

That's a good man. ❤ that made my heart smile.

 My partner does the same thing, it's an absolute lifesaver! Which app do you use? I have the same issues. Reading “Getting Things Done” (by David Allen) and using the techniques learned from it have helped immensely. 

EDIT: [Helpful summary of GTD technique here](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) And my social security card. And my Birth Certificate. And..  I have a box that all of this shit goes in.  My husband does not touch this box for fear of my wrath (also he doesn’t care where the important documents are as long as I know where they are).  Taking things out of this box and not putting them back IMMEDIATELY after finishing with them is cause for a huge fit.  If they don’t go in the box I don’t know where they are. 😥 Get an "important crap" box or something like that. 

I did and it was a life changer - my passport, National Insurance card (UK version of the Social Security card I suppose), assorted USB sticks, hell even my old blockbuster card is in there.

I also have a plastic folder for paperwork that has my birth cert, NHS card, copy of my will, driving test pass certificate... everything that's important goes in there.

Getting into the habit of putting stuff in the same place works pretty well too - I know for a fact my keys are going to be in X place, next to my wallet. Unless I leave them in the front door and somebody else takes them out and puts them somewhere else... Oh no thanks for reminding me. Mine is somewhere in my flat, I'm sure...  I have invested in a man-bag with metal rings on the shoulder strap so I can just hook my keys to it. Now, when I leave my keys in my right front pants pocket, I just get that relatively mild panic-attack single heartbeat (I don't know if anyone else gets this but seriously, 1 or 2 really hard hearbeats) as opposed to full blown melt down. 🤣  I once left my wallet on the trunk of my car while getting gas and forgot it there. I got to my destination, 30 minutes of highway speeds later, and it was still there!!! It wound up getting wedged between the back windshield and the top of the trunk door. The ADHD gods were smiling on me that day. *laughs in ADHD* lol! Honestly every time I drive and I see someone look at me I have an internal panic and wonder if I've left anything on the roof of the car again. Wallet? Phone? Kids? Food?  Fuck.. Couple months ago I bought a $150 jacket which is a very rare thing for me to do. Two weeks later I leave it on top of my car while I make a drive to the nearby grocery store. It’s maybe a mile away. When I realized what I did I walked up and down the path I took about 8 times looking everywhere for it. I had only been in the store about 15 mins and I guess somebody grabbed it. This speaks to me on a spiritual level. "How can you keep forgetting??" Who the fuck knows! I just DO! I don't have the answer!! I also get how it's been (and still is) frustrating to my family when I can't uphold a routine and I can be reminded of the same things 5 times in a day and still forget it, but it's also fucking hard being the person who forgets!! I do this and it works for me like a charm.

How i organize my ADHD at my door https://imgur.com/gallery/zMvl8lN This is why I have multiple cheap pairs... “Good idea!” *goes to store *buys some snacks and maybe that Chromecast you have been trying to figure out whether or not you need (or would Apple TV benefit my experience better?) hmmm...Chromecast it is *goes home (door is locked) “Damn! Forgot my keys in the car” “Where are my keys?!” *find them on top of car where you set them so you could pick up all of your bags, because you knew you could get it all  in one trip...”I didn’t get the hook...” *has anxiety attack about spending money on snacks and Chromecast instead of the hook you went to get Or a bowl! My keys and wallet always go in a bowl by my front door. Otherwise, they're not where I need them *when* I need them. Plus, a wallet and keys are only necessary when leaving the house, so putting them by the door makes logical sense to me. \*laughs in ADHD\* > or every leftovers container at a restaurant... 

This hits home.   If you play at a friend's house or someplace you trust, ask leave your stuff there! 

All my character sheets have a nice place in the GM's handbook while we aren't playing. I didn't even have the money, luckily I have a good brother with an actual savings account. That is, before the angles showed up, or after?  How old is the donkey meaning and how old is the asshole meaning? You, i like I JUST DID THIS Me 💯💯💯 😂😂😭 Aw, thanks. He makes me smile, too. He is kind, patient, and has mythical levels of concentration (he played chess tournaments as a kid, teaches chess to kindergartners, and is a middle school math teacher). I dare say, I picked the right one for me. Cheers to supportive partners! It's honestly wonderful to see others have good partners, too. To speak my truth, I had such a dysfunctional and traumatic childhood I'm always in awe that someone good like my partner exists, that we found each other, and that I have enough self awareness and emotional intelligence to recognize what an amazing person he his; that he respects me and loves me just as I am (unlike some boneheads I dated lol. But, hey, I learned!). 

All the best to you and everyone that relates to OP's post. Habitica! Yeah I'd really like to know too Really? I’ll have to look it up sometime! I...
Don't know where my safe place for these was. I just don't recall where I put them I thought they were in a lock box but it turned out to be empty when I moved I looked frantically through my overly elaborate filing system for an hour, trying to figure out where I would have filed my passport, until I finally found it in a folder confusingly located in "I" for "Important" . . . You can say purse. It's not a girl thing. All the dudes in Shakespeare had purses.  I got a new purse that has those hooks. Love it. I use them 90% of the time. I feel so organized when I look for them and they’re actually there! Before I got diagnosed, there were THREE separate times that happened to me. Twice was my phone and I was driving my dads truck and it fell in the bed.  I left the fuel cap on the ledge of a kombi roof and drove an hour before randomly remembering it - still there :) Excuse me, but is that your toddler on the roof of your car eating a sandwich and ordering stuff on Amazon?  That "strength" in all caps made me chuckle, but I mean that in the best way possible. I feel like I’d end up forgetting to put shit in there all the time and would learn to look there last for the things I want.  I just wanna curl up and cry and eat donuts reading this.. Too real.. Too dang real Just order it on amazon, right now. Before. It's in a group of words that can be traced back even before the Roman Empire. I believe the "ass" that survived from proto-celtic is in fact the one that means "donkey".  Ass/arse as in "butt" seems to come from germanic, it looks like it traces back to the same roots as "arsch" in German, and probably just got corrupted into "ass" at some point by english speakers.

Both words can ultimately be traced back to before we have solid history, but the "asshole" meaning is definitely newer to english than the "donkey" one, even if it's more common these days. The word has always been used with both meanings as far as we can tell. When extended to people you are essentially saying the person is behaving in the same negative ways as the animal: stupid, won't listen to reason, being headstrong, and likely to lash out at you \(kick\) when you are not looking. That’s sweet :) My bf has an incredible memory and level of successful responsibility that I simply can’t comprehend. But oh boy, am I thankful for it! And the patience he shows me and my executive dysfunctions.  Awesome matches for ADHD are amazing. My husband just did a course in project management - that's what he does for a job. He showed me the list of steps for how to manage/implement a project successfully and it was crazy - super super complicated, yet also familiar/reminiscent of how I've read/thought about breaking down everyday tasks for the ADHD brain. I mean, these are the exact same steps. The difference being that neurotypical folks tend to do these things automatically for everyday activities (or just notice, when something fails on one of these points where the failure was so they can correct it next time whereas it totally floors me) - I struggle to do this kind of thing for everyday tasks and find it impossibly complicated, yet he knows almost intuitively how to do it for massive, really complicated projects and not fuck up - it was probably the clearest metaphor for why we work together to date. All the best to you too! My partner and I often joke that we're really a terrible mix- they have OCD and a speech impediment, I have ADHD with a side of auditory processing disorder- but we both try to be patient with each other, and we've come up with a system that more or less works. Glad you've also found someone so fantastic  Thank you! You've already forgotten about looking this up, haven't you?  *laughs in ADHD*  I've edited my comment to include a link to a summary of the "GTD" system that I found while going down a 1 hour internet rabbit hole. Benefit from my distraction! Oh god.  That’s my nightmare.  I have filing bins I put everything in and the important docs went there until we got a metal box last year, and since then all important stuff like that goes straight into the box and never comes out unless absolutely required.  Now that we’re more settled, location-wise, I need to just put it all in a safe deposit box. Oh god, I've done that so many times.

"Of course I won't forget it's under this section! Why would I?"

*one week later*

"Where the fuck is my *important item*? I know it's here somewhere! Has somebody been routing through my stuff?!"

Turns out I'm my own worst enemy. Once I lost my car keys for a whole day and couldn't leave the house because I'd gone to the fridge and instead of putting them in my pocket while I was getting milk out to make a cup of tea, I'd put my keys inside the door shelf of the fridge where the milk had been...

I actually did the same as you with my passport. I left it in my suitcase with the thought that "well, I'll need to pack a suitcase if I'm going somewhere I'll need a passport", except the last time I went somewhere I needed a passport I could only take hand luggage... so I didn't need the suitcase. This was 3 days before my flight - I was about to pay £180 for a passport same/next day until my partner found it buried in a suitcase under the bed. It's you need sex.  
  
Wait... Ahhhh buut I left my phone on my bumper and drove like 15 minutes (only @ like 40mph) but the fact it remained was mind boggling. Thankfully someway it stayed. 

I just realized while typing this I went upstairs like 10 minutes ago to get my phone charger, and got snacks instead, now I’m racing my 1% battery to post this. 

*Laughs in ADHD*  No joke, kids of ADHD parents become self sufficient pretty young :P Oh it has taken me years to always do it now. Hehe.  And then plan to someday get around to finding your power drill which you will set next to the door in hopes of someday getting around to screwing the hook to the wall! OMG you are definitely my people. It was most likely borrowed into the Germanic languages from Latin. It spread through Northern Europe via contact with the Romans but during the later period of [Proto\-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language). So even before Old English but not before the expansion of Rome in Europe, though technically before the Imperial era,  Rome was already a European powerhouse having conquered Iberia and the Alpine Gauls were basically becoming Roman in their material culture. So it's like wine. Very old in our language but also still from Latin.   

[https://www.etymonline.com/word/ass](https://www.etymonline.com/word/ass)

> solid ungulate quadruped beast of burden of the horse kind, but smaller and with long ears and a short mane, native to southwest Asia, Old English *assa* \(Old Northumbrian *assal*,* assal*d\) "he\-ass." The English word is cognate with Old Saxon* esi*l, Dut*ch e*zel, Old High Germ*an e*sil, Germ*an E*sel, Goth*ic asi*lus, and, beyond Germanic, Lithuani*an asi*las, Old Church Slavon*ic *osl, Russi*an os*elŭ, etc. All probably are ultimately from Lat*in asi*nu**s. De Vaan says the form** ***of asi***n**us suggests it was a loan\-word into Latin, and adds, "Most IE words for 'ass' are loanword**s."  I'm glad you have that. It makes a world of difference to have someone supportive in a chaotic world that gaslights you.  Same to you! Just the other morning I made it about 5 miles from my house with my phone resting on a windshield wiper of my car.. Didn't notice until it flew up over the car...

Otter cases for the win here folks.. Phone was fine.. But laughing in ADHD  There’s hope! I always look for things last in the place that they’re supposed to be. I just hopped in this group after being diagnosed at 35 and I am sooooo happy to have found my people. It’s amazing. We’re amazing!!! Yeah, I remember digging into "ass" a bit more and finding that its history isn't the most simple and clear-cut by any means.  There are better examples of words that trace back in that way, but "ass" is the most amusing.

This is pure speculation, but the animal itself has an extremely long history and was spread all over Africa, Asia and Europe.  The word "ass" most likely spread along with it, making the exact origin of the word rather hazy since it could technically be a loanword from any number of sources.  Latin is the easiest and most logical source to point toward since it spread so widely and strongly through Europe. You're probably right about it spreading that way and it's the most accepted theory. The same thing probably happened with [cats.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#Nomenclature_and_etymology) But that one is even more convoluted as it's also been proposed that the Latin word was borrowed from Germanic... I don't know when the earliest signs of the domestic cat are from in Western Europe but it wouldn't surprise me at all if they weren't a part of the earliest agricultural toolbox. Interesting stuff.
