I was really bummed that I forgot to buy my wife a birthday gift. She was cool about it, but I felt miserable during dinner. Before bed she asked if I wanted to see Hamilton and that’s when I remembered that I bought her $3,000 opera season tickets a few months ago to give her on her birthday. Spent the entire evening totally bummed out that I didn’t get my wife a birthday present. Then before bed she asked if she should get us tickets to Hamilton and that’s when I remembered that I had gotten her a season to the opera, center box.

She laughed, shook her head, and told me that I was lucky that she could serve as my memory. 

Edit: I’ve been meaning to post this since March, when it happened, but just now got around to it. Nice! I love it when past me is looking out for future me. Present me is very inconsiderate. 

I've never been to the opera, always wanted to go it seems fun. ADHD: when your surprise gifts are a surprise even to you. You belong here. 

When someone asks me of I can do something Saturday I tell them I need to check my "schedule." I call my wife "hey, are we doing anything saturday?" Oh yeah I've got to leave for vacation that day... I've panicked days before birthdays trying to figure out what to get people, only to remember one of the things that comes to mind as an idea for a gift is already wrapped up and ready to go.  I simultaneously love it and hate it when my girlfriend remembers stuff for me, she's my literal other half [deleted] I've done similar things - buy presents when I see something instead of waiting closer to the date. I always put them in the bottom of my computer desk, so I just open that drawer before getting gifts or freaking out. This is the best. My girlfriend says I'm really organised because she sees me putting everything into apps and lists and all that.

What she doesn't see is that if I didn't have those I'd forget to eat...which I did...last Sunday.

You clearly maximized a hyperfocus session and it payed off. A great lesson. This is why my mom and I go Christmas shopping together. That way, I can pick out what I want or need and it's still a surprise once Christmas comes around.  Jesus.  The opera has gotten expensive since my NYC days.   So you didn't miss the performance? Happy ending! But, you should go see Hamilton if you can. It was so good! You gotta set timers/alarms for this shit man haha. It's the only thing that has saved me sometimes. However, sometimes I just end up seeing the alarm and description on my phone and say, "eh. I don't really feel like doing that right now", and either never do the thing or I convince myself it wasn't that important anyway.  Very relatable. I was going to be on holiday for my boyfriend's birthday last year, so I ordered his gift in advance, to be delivered on his birthday. The day before I'm totally freaking out because I just remembered it's his birthday tomorrow and I haven't gotten him anything, until my mum gently reminds me of the present I'd already ordered. 

At least I wasn't being careful for nothing. The edit is brilliant, and so, so relateable.  Hey man, your wife is a keeper!  If she didn't have a problem with you forgetting to buy her a birthday present, I suspect she is pretty laid back about a lot of things. I fucking *adore* this sub, sometimes. 

Thank you for succeeding the the same horrible ways I do. :D Wished I could upvote again after I read ur edit! Haha. 
 I'm simultaneously happy that I could up-vote this great post but sad that my vote changed it from 311 to 312 because 311 is a good  band.  Now pay it forward to future you, again.  Nice! I want to have a girlfriend like that ... Yep. I always tell myself "Do the right/good/nice thing now so you don't have to do it later". Sometimes I can't remember I did the right thing ever.  So fucking relatable.  Stay strong!! Dangerous when you buy the same gift twice, lol GENIUS!  I would have spilled the beans right there! Thank you!! I forgot that our favorite band is in town just a few days before her birthday next week... birthday saved!! I uh, forgot to buy my wife a Christmas present one year.  Good job!! And, nice present!!! Lol nice Oh wow...I can relate to this.  

I am an ADHD parent with two kids who LOVE to hunt down any presents that they might be getting.  I periodically find gifts around the house that I hid well and totally forgot about.  If I'm lucky, I can use them for the next birthday or holiday.  However, sometimes they have completely outgrown them...  in which case they go into the bin for Toys for Tots in the basement.  That bin seems to get bigger every year. Hahaha, nice!  Hamilton

Is your wife's boyfriend forgetful Too?
 Omg I'm so glad you remembered them before the season was over! I tend to buy gifts months in advance and then give them months in advance because I can't wait to give them.  After reading a lot of these comments, it amazes me that this kind of stuff happens to so many other people. Actually, after reading multiple posts on r/ADHD I feel like I've found a community of people that understand and go through exactly what I go through. I've always suspected that I might have an attention deficit disorder, but after reading this it really seems like I do. I do stuff like this all the time.  Thats awesome, I fucking love Hamilton That's cause present you is always looking out for future you ad infinitum xD. Opera is really fun. Just enjoy the ridiculousness of it :D

I’ve once seen a very, very rotund, older singer nearly breaking character and stiffing laughter when her partner in stage was signing to her “oh fair maiden, so slender and beautiful, so young and innocent yadda yadda”. All in very over the top costumes, to make it more surreal ;) Past me is equally a scum bag and a good guy setting me up right, love past me looool this sounds a lot like Brian Finch from limitless. Wonder if the producer had adhd... I try to leave a gift or better life for future me. I at least know he's very thankful that past me took the time to care. :) Do it, it's great. You get to wear your nice clothes and the music is just superb. Verdi, Rossini, Wagner, Beethoven, Prokofiev, there are so many great composers. Check out ballet as well, everyone should at least watch Tchaikovskys Nutcracker and Swan Lake once in their life.  Came here to say this.  That's the best kind of gift.  It's the big kid version of when you pop something in the microwave and sit back down in front of the TV only to be surprised and curious why the microwave went off a few minutes later.  Sweet.  Someme made me a burrito. I love that but sometimes it can bite me if I order something twice.  I preorder stuff sometimes months even a year ahead of time and completely forget about having preordered anything.

Last week I saw a post about how a collectors edition of a movie I like was being released soon so I was like "hey, I was going to order this .. best to do it now".  After ordering on Amazon I decided to take a look if I had something else arriving this month,  and lo and behold a 4ish month old preorder for the movie I had just ordered (again) 3 minutes prior :) Yeah, that me to. Only she has ADHD too, if less badly most of the time, so she then had to double check her actual personal planner/calendar. I have came into work during my vacation because I had forgotten. Wife ended up calling me when I didn't return home. I was suppose to go and get gas. [deleted] I do this constantly lol! I don’t make any plans without checking with the little lady. Although now we share a family calendar so it’s a little easier to say “I think I can do that, but let me double check!” Our partners probably need a sub about dealing with, good and bad When your wife has ADD and you have ADHD, and you need to remember stuff... I have constant calendar reminders shared between the both of us... Only way I can keep up with anything going on. [This is my life now. Good thing is ADHD is way easier to deal with having all this technology to remind me to do crap. ](https://i.imgur.com/0uw5y8s.png) Especially if it’s already wrapped. Wrapping that shit is HARD! I don’t hate it at all. Although she has suggested to me that she could easily implant memories into my brain for nefarious purposes if she was so inclined. I’ve learned not to question her recall.

Fortunately she’s a peach! Haha, yeah my first thought was "well, at least dude has his ADHD controlled well enough to keep a job that can help him afford $3000 purchases?" Right? Like some days my symptoms are bad, but they've never been "$3000 purchase slips my mind" bad. It's ADHD... any of us can easily forget anything.  Smart!! A designated gift location. I do that same thing buying beforehand too,  this would help to make a habit Dude I do the same thing. My friends who know about the future gift drawer find it weird but it’s such a lifesaver! Thank goodness for apps, right?

I just learned that you can set up an Alexa to deliver the tasks into Wunderlist. 

With another app - IFTTT. 

Note, I believe authorizing IFTTT allows all your emails to be read / modified so set up and use a separate email address only used for IFTTT / Wunderlist / Amazon (Alexa).  I didn't eat today because I thought I'd left my lunch at home. Upon returning home I realized I'd left it at work. Oh the joys of our day to day lives...  Oh my gosh, I do this too, with my husband. I'll order stuff online, he'll make sure he's the one that gets the delivery, and I'm still surprised on my birthday or Christmas at what I got myself! I’m pretty sure box seats at the Met for an entire season would be quite a bit more than what I paid out here. Wanted to get her box seats though ‘cause she deserves the best! Once it’s on her schedule, it’s on my schedule, haha.  We did. Fantastic show! So she got that *plus* a season at the opera. that is def true for tasks, but reminders for things future me needs to know.

Like i've been kicking myself for losing the registry card for friends upcoming wedding, turns out i just put the url in a reminder for two weeks before the wedding. :) Totally a keeper! She’s the yin to my yang, as relaxed and laid back as I am anxious and passionate. Wonderful mother to our kids. She’s also completely understanding of my ADHD—I wasn’t diagnosed until a few years ago, and I’m no spring chicken—and completely supportive as well.

Total jackpot! I did!

At her birthday dinner I told her that I was really sorry that I never made it out to find her a gift. Even the actual dinner out was sort of spur-of-the-moment last minute. The combination of both made me feel as small as a bug.

She was super cool about it (or if she was annoyed she didn’t really show it).

When we got home we were both hanging out surfing  the ‘net when she saw that a new batch of Hamilton tickets had been released and asked me if I wanted to go. Since it was her birthday I said, “yeah, but let me get them for your birthday” and it was at that exact moment that I realized that I had been sitting on opera tickets for months!

So I said, “wait, I did get you a present!” (didn’t say what) and then spent the next 40 minutes digging through my e-mail to find the confirmation because, well, you know why.  Anyway I found it and forwarded it to her and she got really super excited.

I mean, I guess going from “I didn’t get a gift” to “OMG I can’t believe you got me *this!*” has to be pretty fun. She loves opera (I’m a convert) and never had box seats before so she was really, really happy. 

I was feeling pretty proud and sheepish at the same time. Then she started laughing and said, “I can’t believe you forgot that you bought me tickets after spending so much money on them!” to which I had no good reply. She made her standard “good thing I’m your memory” joke, said a few lighthearted things about ADHD, and then we went to bed.

All and all a perfect and relatable and all-to-common day of my life. But even I’m amazed that I forgot about spending so much money! I have actual nightmares about this. Every single Autumn, I have an anxiety dream that it's Christmas and I haven't bought a single gift for my son or husband.

I'm so sorry you had to live my nightmare. I too love the past me that cares for present me.  The ridiculousness is real!

My husband's and my first opera was Die Walkure. There was a **lot** more incest than we expected. Like, infinitely more? Opera also makes a great web browser.  Took me a while to figure out there was a typo there, and not an ASL interpreter at an Opera breaking character. Hey, why in the hell does my flat look like a fucking dump? HUH? Ooooh, 2lbs of chocolate! Thanks buddy, you’re the best! [deleted] I do the same thing now, no shame in my game. I will say to people "I can't write it down now so you have to remind me because I *will* forget otherwise". Then I ask them to email or text it to me.

It's way better to let people know this than to feel like you continually mess up.  I agree. I've seen SO's here before. But you mean like a support group? They would probably love a place to vent. That's a good idea. 

Thankfully my wife works with kids with mental disorders including adhd so she understand my brain more than I do. I'm very thankful for that.  Surprisingly enough I do most of the bills and money handling. Ever since I downloaded Mint app I doubt we have even missed a payment on anything. I recommend it instead of Google calenders because I like the way I can mark your bills as paid and they turn green and automatically go to the next month. It also has reminders for all bills.  I forgot I bought a house once. 

Totally just spaced out leaving the office and drove to the apartment I had before I bought my house. It was only a couple weeks after buying the house so it was still kinda new to me, but still. Haha, right? That’s the best part of the story. Even my wife was like, “how did you forget that you spent over $3,000 on a gift?”

Me: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  Until the day I open it and past self let me down. I think your friends' opinion is weird, not the drawer  Ahaha, fantastic. Yesterday I freaked out because I forgot my card and needed to pay an important bill. Only to get home and realise it was in the special pocket in my bag specifically devoted to cards... Nice! Hahaha, awesome.  I’m not surprised at all. Only up to version 12 everything after that is just a chrome reskin. Autocorrect chose the wrong word. Also, it took me like 5 minutes to find the typo :D 2 lb ≈ 900 g

Egads. My fiance and I also have ADHD.

Like attracts like? My wife and I both have ADHD. It's probably why we get along so well. But mine's way worse. She was actually undiagnosed until last year. I use Mint as well, but the reminders that go to my phone and work computer from Google Calendar work better for me personally. I'm at a computer desk most of my day. People do that kind of autopilot thing pretty often, though. I've done it between apartments  A Chrome reskin with Chinese data mining. mwahaha I know, it's so hard to find typos in your own writing! Good bot Good bot [deleted] Are you my husband? Seriously, exact same story. I also use mint and have everything set to pre-authorized payment. It's good because my credit score has gone up significantly since I stopped missing bills. It's bad because I've paid two months' insurance on a car I no longer drive...  As an opera user, what's all this about?  Yay ٩(&#94;ᴗ&#94;)۶ Thank you comedian42 for voting on metric\_units.

Well, those things often accompany ADHD too. Was he actually diagnosed with ASD, or does he just think he's ASD? I knew a few ADHD people who suspect they have ASD but have never been diagnosed, but they usually don't realize that a lot of the secondary effects of ADHD can sometimes look like ASD. Oddly enough, same with my wife and I.  Sometimes we're really on top of things, other times we're both an utter and complete mess. Yea, we are trying to fix our credit... Mine's gone up a good bit since I've started managing things this way. They got bought by a Chinese consortium in 2016: https://www.engadget.com/2016/07/18/opera-browser-sold-to-a-chinese-consortium-for-600-million/ I think we are attracted to each other. I swear I went through school going "This is weird. Why are 80% of my friends dyslexic? Surely that is out of proportion." No, turns out dyslexia is just shorthand for it's the 90s and we know you're neurodiverse but we're scared of Ritalin, and all autists are rainman, so dyslexia will do! Although most of my friends do actually have dyslexia. Sounds about right. Good for you! It's a pain in the ass, but it's super worthwhile.
