When you forget your university ID on the first day and can’t log in your attendance... Ahhh just the typical case of ADHD. Literally forgot the one thing I was supposed to have on me - my ID. Couldn’t swipe my card and even though I attended class, got an absence. Yay. How does the absence affect you? What happens as a result of your absence?  One of my classes did this as well, but they had a form we were supposed to sign stating that we showed up. Perhaps next time, speak to the prof after class so they know you showed up? At my university, every absence you have affects your grade by 2%. So yeah what a great way to start my year! The professors here say that we can’t tell them we attended class but forgot our ID. Apparently then a lot of people start doing that and it’s time consuming for the prof. Basically they are just too lazy to manually go into the system & replace the absence for each student. In that case you must ask them to recognise your attendance and let them know about your situation. As it's the first day they should make an exception. it can't hurt to ask. If they refuse to help, that could be classed as a form of discrimination if ADHD was he cause of forgetting your ID - which it no doubt was. Not to mention you are paying for the education and you should get what you have paid for. Good luck! If you're not sure how to approach it, be polite and say something like:

>I'm very sorry, but I have ADHD and got a little overwhelmed with all the new things I had to do on the first day and forgot to bring my University ID. Fortunately, I did manage to attend all my classes, but my attendance record is now incorrect. Can you please help me to correct my attendance record?

&#x200B; I actually sent an email about it but I never got a respond. I guess I’ll confront the prof about it in real life.
