Too many notepads? Good morning r/ADHD! So I am currently trying to get my self organized. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child (about 20 years ago) and have been on and off medication all of my life. After recently looking at the bigger picture of things I decided to get put back on Adderall, so far so good. I want to try and start getting things in check in my life... I do work out pretty consistently and my schedule stays the same pretty much every week but now I want to start adding things to improve my self and life (Ex.. social events, playing basketball a couple times a month, learning how to code, projects, etc). I currently carry a small notepad around for general purposes to make sure I remember to do things. I have a notebook for my journal (currently it's trial and error for adderall) and I have a general notebook with graph paper... which feels a little daunting when I put a tiny list into it.

I looked at the bullet journal last night and it seems interesting.. but I feel like my organization and priorities get mixed up... anyone have any ideas of what to do? Should I condense everything in one book? Thanks for your help!  at univ here 
I have only 1 notebook for ALL my classes . 

I had my first semester where I had everything :) 

I ' ve tried many bullet journals 

but google calendar on computer + phone is the one working the most
 + we have to put deadlines 
 I'm personally a digital person, but How To ADHD has some cool short videos on the subject: https://youtu.be/jkZEEQG6IVE [deleted] I am totally a notepad fiend, just at my desk right now I have four notebooks on the desktop and two more in my drawer, it's kind of a problem.  My favorite are spiral-bound graph paper notebooks that are about 7x5 inches.  The spiral binding helps me keep my place and pages don't fall out, the graph paper allows me to doodle and is more 'open' and accepting than regular lined pages, and the 7x5 size fits easily in my shoulder bag.  Hey, that's me, though, and I'm sure everyone will have their preferences.  

Edit: I found a fifth notebook on my desktop I've put up a few corkboards on my wall and bought some neon index cards and bright post its. Each corkboard represents a different area of my life... Chores/house projects, errands/tasks/to do's, school assignments/homework, and a hobby/habit tracker where I record daily things like exercise, meditation, etc. 

I've tried a different app/planner/journal every year for the past fifteen years, and this is the only thing that's worked for me. I like that it's visually stimulating, I can't lose or misplace them, and they're always there so I can't ignore them. Plus I would feel like I'd "ruined" my planner if I didn't complete or log enough tasks... With the corkboards it's easy to just take down a notecard and rewrite it. I save all the old cards, so I still have a log of everything I've completed! 

I wrote in various apps/planners/journals for 2 years to schedule a damn dentist appointment; with the corkboards I scheduled an appointment in three days! They have some stylish corkboards on Amazon; I can't recommend that method enough! Hope you find something that works for you! I work at a job that technically does not require me to hand write absolutely anything. Except apparently that's [not an option for me](http://imgur.com/EPSx5VV)  I TYPICALLY (currently have four) stick to just one notebook with EVERYTHING IN IT.  Bills to pay, to do list, grocery list, ETC.   Have a look at the filofax clipbook. It isn't too expensive and has a calendar (weekly) and different types of paper (blank, lined, graph). This way you can use it for everything and don't need to draw stuff yourself.  I know exactly what you mean and am still trying to figure out just how to utilize my (way too many and always increasing) notebooks. This is my current simplification attempt:

**Bullet journal** (stays on my desk, everything goes in there; notes on whatever I'm studying or reading for fun, ideas, things I want to reference later, To-do lists, dates to remember, weekly goals and checklists, etc), **pocket notebook** (small enough to stay in my pocket at all times, anything at all that I want to remember gets put here before I forget, no organisation to it, often used to write down checklists of what I'm supposed to be immediately doing, eg 'put socks in washer, eat dinner, drink water, put socks in dryer' because it's hard for me to remember that taking care of the mundane is important), and a **writing notebook** (for free writing and general journaling, putting down feelings and exploring thoughts, doing therapy exercises, etc).

These three are my focus now, cut down from what ballooned to a dozen different more specialized purpose notebooks. 

I'm a painter, and also have a general purpose sketchbook for keeping painting ideas and notes (but would like to merge it with the bullet journal somehow).

Bullet journaling is fantastic for me but I'm still learning to force myself to put everything in there. In general, writing down on paper works SO much better for my head than digital, especially when trying to reference it later. This took me way too long to realize, but the less I divide stuff up by purpose, the more likely I am to find and use it again. It's better for me to have a bunch of related items lose in a drawer than set up little dividers for everything in the drawer to be 'more organized'. Same goes with written stuff.



 COLOR CODING. I tried sticking to one notebook for school and everything was cluttered and I didn't separate things in it. So I started color coding my classes. THAT led me to having multiple notebooks (about 5 usually) all in different colors so that I would have 1 color for each class. Surface pro 3 + pen + OneNote. No more notebooks for me! Just don't end up carrying a bunch of partially-filled notebooks like I did; it makes matters worse. Consolidation is better. 

The only extra that might be helpful are a stack of index cards or a slim tiny notebook for taking down notes/reminders on the spur... which beats never writing down in the first place & regretting it or scribbling it on a scrap piece of paper which you then find in your pocket weeks or months later.  

I also shifted from pencils to one of my old Waterman pens after I swapped it with quick-drying gel ink. Anything that that 'drag' as I wrote seemed to all affect my output. 

Google Calendar is also a Godsend; the alarms/reminders are often more than one and will hit my phone, iPad and laptop to get off my ass and out the door. 
 Yeah, Google calendar on all my devices has been a massive help. I still feel like I could utilize it better though tbh, I sometimes end up putting things like "tidy your room" in it and just not actually doing them and just moving them to the next day again and again.. I love Google calendar notifications, I have notifications for *everything* I keep seeing field note around as a decent not pad... I have a tiny spiral notepad I keep in my pocket but I don't think it's working to well. Think I may switch to the field notes notepad I have about.... 6 or 7 note books and pads laying around... thing is I don't utilize them.. I don't really know what to put in all of them. I'll start writing in one and then realize.. "no that should go in this one" I get a little confused right now. I currently am using one as a journal for my medication to see what kind of differences I notice but other than that one consistency I'm at a loss.. I don't really doodle either (maybe I should start)  Did that on my car dashboard (passenger). Post It's and reminders all over. Oh look it's my desk >_>

Same--nothing paper required, but I have a legal pad, a 4x6 pad, my personal spiral notebook, my personal planner, a work-specific paper planner, and 6 sticky notes. And a whiteboard. I should probably evaluate my system... See that's my problem... I have all these different note books and partially start eat one.. just really need to figure out how to consolidate everything  I should mention that I only use one of them at a time, then I fill it up and go to the next one.  They tend to accumulate around me but at any one point in time I am only really using one of them.  I put everything in it, whether work stuff or personal.  Once it's full I move on to the next one. See my issue is I try and use all of them at once... then I get overwhelmed and they just kind of sit haha
