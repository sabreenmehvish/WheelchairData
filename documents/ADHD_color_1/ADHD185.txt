Post your weird habbits! I always find myself wandering around when i'm waiting for the bus, while everyone else is perfectly still.  * i shop for groceries 20 mins before closing time and always buy the same items. i am eating the same dish for the past 5 years. 

* songs in my mp3 player are either a thousand times played or none

* get a job, improve things, get fired for incompetence, repeat

* when walking dog, the dog wants to go home but i want to walk for another half hour or so

* drinking threatening amounts of coffee, 6 cups is the average amount for me

* when somebody asks me how do i know that, i have to make something up because i am too embarrassed to say "i spend some nights browsing Wikipedia and reading random articles. its like sleepwalking" i just happen to know what a gogol is by accident, or i read this in a magazine few weeks ago

* using a keylogger on myself to find out the passwords that i changed and forgot

* watching a movie multiple times in a row because you really liked it. or walking out the cinema after 10 mins because you didn't. i have seen "the martian" 6 times. and i have the feeling i will watch it again soon

* constantly being pissed of when seeing incandescent lightbulbs, god dammit, all that wasted energy Making weird faces and voices when im talking because im weird and thats how i hear myself in my head. 
Never proofreading my text lead to a lot of embarrassing mistakes. Likw i type out a word completely different then the one i was thinking like wtf hand. Are you and me on the same wavelength or not Well, I have typical ADHD habits like rocking back and forth a little sitting at my desk, tapping my fingers or my foot, bouncing my leg, fidgeting during a meeting and looking around... I sing unconsciously...a lot...this may be a habit of singers, but many times something someone says will remind me of a song lyric, and even though I don't say anything, 10 minutes later, I'll start singing that song...

And my husband plays with me by singing the first half of a phrase, knowing I'll be totally distracted unless I finish the phrase. 

Or he'll sing one note or word off, knowing I absolutely must correct it. 

I also can't find something unless I remember what color it is...and if it's surrounded by a bunch of things in the same color (black bag on a black chair), it's hopeless!
