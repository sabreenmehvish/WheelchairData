Color coded to do lists? I was wondering if people here had specific ways they color coded their to do lists. I find color coding things helps me a bit, but I have issues prioritising with the traditional red yellow and green system. I write my list in pen, with square boxes beside each task.  They get a "/" if it's started but not complete and an "X" if complete.

I use a yellow highlighter to make more inportant tasks stand out, and then sometimes outline them with a red sharpie or put red exclamation marks if they're really important.

I know you said the traditional red doesn't really work, but maybe the "/" and "X" thing could help? I like using color codes to differentiate between categories of tasks. Bills and finance are green. Appointments are red. Personal appointments are purplet. etc.  http://todoist.com/ Thank you, however I was asking more about strategies people like to use to color code.
