first psychiatrist visit- suggestions? im a 25yo female. My 10yo brother just got diagnosed with ADHD and my dad called and told me to get tested. He said he says now that he is more educated about it he wishes they wouldve tested me younger. I've suspected I had ADHD for a while, but I figured a doctor would just think I was another college student trying to get a stimulant. Now i've graduated and working and everything is worse. I guess I thrived on a very strict schedule and having to try to focus for 8 hours a day is impossibly draining and im overwhelmed to the point of major depression. I have antidepressants but they aren't doing much (if anything). I am also in cognitive therapy. And its all about making lists and schedules, but honestly even making a list is a huge task.

Anyway I have an appointment with a psychiatrist in a month, but the idea of this appointment is making me anxious. I don't even know where to start explaining my symptoms. I'm scared if I go in saying I think i have ADHD he will think i'm diagnosing myself. Should I expect him to lead the conversation or me? Will there be more than one appointment?  Tell her/him that your meth dealer got arrested so you need a fix like bad. Then start scratching yourself compulsively. Offer sexual services.

Alternatively, you could say

 * what spurred your visit
 * who in your family is affected
 * how long you've been affected (since childhood is the 'correct' answer)
 * the effect of it impacting your life
 * the extent of your coping mechanisms
 * mention if you have tried stimulants in the past (if you say, "I tried Ritalin once and it was like night and day..." that makes the psychologist's job easy)

Once you discuss the ADHD stuff you'll want to clear up (she or he will ask)

 * have you ever been suicidal? 
 * do you have other things going on? (Anxiety? Depression? etc) I suggest you just act normal, it will go a long way into actually figuring out if you have a problem. Just be honest with the doctor about the problems you are experiencing. It's normal to feel anxious about this - when you're there, tell the doc if you feel anxious. When I was diagnosed at age 19, the first appointment was an initial discussion of my symptoms and history. For adults, a necessary part of the diagnoses is having those symptoms during childhood too. At the end she told me she felt I would benefit from a cognitive assessment and a medication trial - she was a psychologist so she wrote a letter to my physician so I could get the script, but a psychiatrist can save that extra step. The full set of tests took three hours - split over two consecutive days, and I first did them with no meds, then came back and repeated the two days of testing with the medication. The tests are things like hearing a story and recalling what you heard, having a list of numbers read off and repeating them back, that one where the words for colors are written in different colors (ex- the word "blue" written in red ink), giving me a set of blocks and various pictures of formations to make with the block, listing all the words you can think of that start with a certain letter, and so on. During the tests she would also ask about my solving strategies and take notes too. After the tests she compares the scores from the tests without and with meds (in my case the difference was staggering) and use that data to decide whether they think meds would help you. The tests were exhausting, and sometimes frustrating. You should be open about when your frustrated, it's important for them to know. The whole process can be time consuming but it's worth it if you find that the meds help you.  I went to my first appointment today.  Make sure you tell them when you make the appointment that you want an ADHD assessment.  I made a list beforehand of all the symptoms/issues I have.  I knew I'd forget everything when it came time to discuss and we reviewed the list together.   Well have you ever had symptoms of actually having ADHD? This isn't something that simply comes and goes. For me it is a debilitating condition. Luckily I have a good financial set up and great insurance that can afford me the medication and doctors I see. 

Just make sure you very much think about the consequences of trying a stimulant medication...

Have you ever been susceptible to over using drugs/alcohol? Amphetamine based medications are no joke. They are stimulating and powerful psychostimulant amphetamines. Make sure you are thoroughly checked out for other disorders. Stimulant induced psychosis and the other extremely disruptive cognitive impairments that can occur when abusing/misuing these medications can develop quickly. This coupled with the high risk of becoming addicted should come into strong consideration before thinking about taking the medication.

Good luck. And make sure to always take to your prescribed dosage and always consult with the doctor before stopping or altering the use of the medication. I highly recommend the book "driven to distraction".  * prepare beforehand by making a list of your family's mental health
* your reason for coming in: your brother was diagnosed, your father became more educated about it and urged you to get tested because he suspects you had it as well. you've managed in a strict environment at college, but now that you're working you've been experiencing many symptoms, especially anxiety but antidepressants aren't helping. (they'll also need to know your diagnosis from your other psychiatrist, who that was and how many times you've seen them, and what medications/dosage you're currently taking or were taking in the past)
* make a list of your symptoms and what you've struggled with at work, you can even look at a checklist of ADHD symptoms and write down which ones you have, try to provide specific details/examples. (perhaps ask your father about symptoms he thinks you have, a different perspective is useful)
* I brought in report cards/evaluations from 3rd grade to high school, which included teacher comments about how I was frequently off-task. If you can provide any information like this, it will be very helpful.
* ask if you can bring your dad (if possible) to the appointment to provide information about when you were younger. (A requirement of an adult ADHD diagnosis is that symptoms were present when you were younger).
* be upfront about why you're there. Say you think you have ADHD right off the bat, don't worry about being stigmatized or taken less seriously.
* You say your piece about why you think you have ADHD, present evidence, then the doctor will ask you questions and diagnose you. Then you can ask additional questions about when to take medication, any additional steps you should take, etc.
* For diagnosis, usually it's just one appointment, but there's a possibly that they'll want you to come back for additional tests. If you're prescribed medication, you will have check ups.
* also mention that the cognitive therapy isn't working, and if you're diagnosed, ask your psychiatrist for a recommendation for a therapist. that's almost exactly what happened to me, when I was tested today ahaha!
