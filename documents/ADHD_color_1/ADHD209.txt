kinds of things in a to-do app? Hey there guys,
I am learning to develop ios apps and for my first project I want to develop a to do for for the ADHD community and for that I was wounding what kinds if things would you like to see in such an app?  Not sure how complex you are planning on getting with it, but some ideas off the top of my head:

* Ability to organize to-do list in to certain categories (created by the user) such as school, work, shopping, cleaning, etc. 
* With the previous one, color-coated items/categories
* Calendar to set dates and times of items
* For an individual item, able to put additional notes about the item 
* Importance/Priority scale (maybe like Very low, Low, Average, High, Very High) that maybe is also color-coated or arranged in order of priority.  Location-based reminders are a lifesaver. [any.do](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydo) is an app that nags you. Great idea. perhaps you could do something similar... Great minds think alike!  I'm planning on doing the same thing to help me learn android sometime in the future.  I was going to use the [Bullet Journal](www.bulletjournal.com) format as my template.  Check it out, I think it really lends itself to both a to-do app and a learning project.  Also, good luck!   I had Palm apps (Palm user from inception to death of the OS) and wrote to the developer / owner of Palm and told him he had put a whole class of us back into the game.  I loved the memo plus, task plus, apps. (Handspring comes to mind as developer company)  they were simple enough to use in every situation (was out of school by then) and I was good enough at 'graffiti' the text environment before keyboard, that I could fill out uncategorized info, set an alarm / repeat and due dates from pulldowns.  One nice thing was I could add categories of reminder as I needed them, and they would populate the pulldown.  Google calendar is OK, but more time to use than the old Palm aftermarket apps ever were. Also, with those, there was always a stylus.  Helped with pulldowns. Most of the fine grading of tasks seemed to be nice, but I never found myself getting past the #1 importance level, because that was only in my head.  Alarms still beeped, and notices popped up.  I would just look, and either do it then, or not, but its pre-supposed level of urgency was immaterial. I'd like to see one focused on the fact that I might not remember to check my damn todo app.  So something that asks me regularly what I'm doing and if it's productive.  I want to keep the app simple but those are all very good ideas, thanks  That's a very good idea,  that would help me as well
