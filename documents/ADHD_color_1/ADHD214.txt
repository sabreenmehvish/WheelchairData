My wardrobe closet doubles as a mirror, now I added a third function for the doors: an organizational calendar [additional details in comments]  *The idea was lifted from [this link](http://www.beautymeetslifestyle.com/2012/07/diy-dry-erase-board-calendar.html) that I saw in r/adhd a few days ago.*

I've had a set of dry erase markers for awhile and wrote color-coded lists for things.  Well, tried to, but it got a bit out of hand.  I can become a bit obsessive, remember far too many minor things I forgot, while on meds.  So the calendar approach simplifies a bit.

I got some tape, a ruler, and a razorblade, tried to make a 7x6 grid as best and as evenly as I could for the monthly calendar.  The seven longer rectangles at the bottom give more room for tasks specific to that week.

I'll still use a color-coding system, but will try to keep it simple.  This is what I have so far:

**GREEN** - Money obligations--due dates of rent, car payment, other bills

**BLUE** - social obligations--happy hours I wish to attend, birthdays and birthday parties, any...well...social event

**RED** - apartment obligations--cleaning, chores, or anytime my roommate asks me for a favor

**BROWN** - "me" obligations--I started a diet (mostly doing paleo/primal) so this color serves as reminders about my health/fitness goals, as long as just plain having "me" time, where I can just relax or take a day or two off meds and do whatever.

Hope you guys find this helpful. As a visual learner, I love writing on mirrors and glass with erasable marker. BRETHREN! [deleted] Wow that's amazing. In my old apartment I used to have 20+ feet of wall to ceiling mirror - I never thought of doing this with it. 

Whiteboards are definetly high on my 'must purchase' list. I'd love to hear what other people here have done with them. 

Hm. Makes me think about  using my bathroom mirror with dry erase markers... it's the one place I look every day.  Have you considered using a ruler and making notches and simply stretching the tape from notch to notch? 

I cringed at the alignment &#3232;\_&#3232;
 I loved it.

I bought myself a whiteboard, bur I feel like getting a second one so I can have a nice and separated calendar like the one on the link too. =D Imgur was being weird on my phone earlier, but here's my [window, a 180 degree turn away!](http://i.imgur.com/XrHpq.jpg)

(My apartment complex isn't bad, quite good actually, but I am two blocks west of the "dividing line" of my city.  In the buffer zone.  Near the 39th parallel, if I may.)
