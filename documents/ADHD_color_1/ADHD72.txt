Advice for Insomnia I've recently discovered some strategies, after literally years of struggle, that allow me to sleep a bit better....they've been working for about two months, more consistently than anything else I've tried. 

• I set an alarm or have my SO wake me up about 1.5 hours before my alarm goes off and take my stimulants. It helps me wake up when I actually have to, and it means that I take my noon dose a bit earlier, too (around 11), so it's out of my system a bit earlier, too. 

-supplements! 
At night: 
Kava kava*
Passionflower*
Slow release Melatonin*
Epsom salt bath/magnesium citrate 
Iron (I'm also prone to anemia, which also causes insomnia)
*these are musts, if I wanna sleep. The Passion flower and melatonin  are in the same pill. I take them after supper because I have a slow metabolism, and they take a long time to kick in. I find the PF and M, help me stay asleep once I'm asleep, and the Kava gets me there. They don't make me drowsy the next day either.

•Day supplements: 
Ashwagandha*
Ginseng (still trying to tell the difference between kinds)
Vitamin D (some people get anxiety from D - if so, try upping your magnesium intake)
Cod liver oil 

-Low lights about an hour before bed, and NO bright light if I wake up in the night. I bought some salt lamps, and they work great. Bright light cancels out your bodies natural melatonin, and most people sleep in two phases. As long as nothing makes you wide awake and alert in the night, if you wake up, just remind yourself it's natural, and meditate, snuggle, go pee, and go back to sleep. Don't turn on the bathroom light! I use a salt lamp nightlight there, too. 

-meditation app--I rotate between a couple, but I really like using a body scan before bed, or a boring bedtime story (MindJRNY has good ones). 

-worry journal---write all the worries you can think of down a few hours before bed, point form, and then tell yourself you don't need to dwell on them, because you've already worried about them that day. 

-orgasms! Knock yourself out ;)

-cold room, heavy blanket---this helps SO much, I reallllly want to get a weighted blanket! 

-No Caffeine in any form after 2pm (chocolate, pop, tea, all count!)

-if you're a bedtime reader, don't pick up that good novel before bed, or you're not gonna put it down. Short stories, self-help books, the Tao te Ching, history books, are what does it for me.

-I have restless legs, so I use tiger balm every night on my legs and feet to stimulate them and stop the restlessness.

-earplugs!!!! I cannot sleep without them. And an eye mask if you can stand it. I'm super touch sensitive, so don't usually like wearing masks, but I found one that looks like a little bra for your head (Bucky eye mask), with the bra cups over your eyes. It looks hilarious, but it worked really well (until I lost the damn thing). 

-and the hardest thing ever, Stop Scrolling!!! I find that one thing that helps me stop, if I feel like I neeeed to be on my phone, is to play a really boring game, with as little visual stimulation as possible (just say NO to Candy Crush). My current jam is Crib with Grandpa! 

-One other thing that helps kick the scrolling/game habit, is to turn your phones colour off. Greyscale your phone, and suddenly, it's just not appealing anymore. I can't describe how much I hated it though.

Any other tips are welcome!! 
 I color at night before going to bed to help me wind-down. Adult coloring books started to became really popular a few years ago. I have a few but [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048679539X/) is my favorite along with these [sharpie markers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UHUIJK6/).
