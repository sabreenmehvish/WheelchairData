Best methods to study for tests? **Rant:** I am hearing "discipline yourself" or "What you do is dumb, don't you see how important studying is?" from all sides, when I am failing to study once again. Fact is studying or even sitting in a lecture is one of the most frustrating experiences in my daily life. It just does't work (My drawings improved a shitload since I started going to university though, so thats that), I sit there for literally 5 minutes and I'm so bored that nothing works. I am studying math and start solving hypothetical mathexcercises instead of doing my fucking studies, because the outcome is more interesting (I sit at this goddamn hypothetical mathexercise for half an hour in deep focus, for fucks sake). I NEED to study or I will fail my classes at university, I got through school without studying, but now its inevitable. Sitting down to learn feels like physical pain, actually it is worse, I would rather burn my arm again daily than sit down and learn. I am not to dumb, that's not it, I am actually quite certain that I learn fasters than many others, which I have heard from a lot of teachers for stuff I am interested in (Writing, drawing, martial arts, languages). Even when writing this damn text Im drifting of. Sorry for all the unneccessary text, but now that I wrote it deleting feels like killing my firstborn.

**Question:** So I have found some methods that will help me learn, for example running or working out before sitting down to study, but this is not enough, it still doesn't work, feels like running against a wall. So, how do you solve this issue? Got any tricks/methods that will improve your learning outcome? Any way to make it less frustrating? Maybe some kind of step for step program to gradually improve studytime, while not making it impossible? Sorry if this is a frequently asked question (which I can imagine), I looked it up, but didn't find a final solution for the issue, so I am here asking once again, hoping for new results. Wow, the visceral reaction you're having definitely sounds like ADD but have you been diagnosed and are you using medication?

The methods you're using sound like they're not helping enough but the only thing I can suggest is organization.  Organizing your time and isolating yourself in a non stimulatory environment so you can stick to your schedule and do good work.  Doing so without medication (if your symptoms are that severe) doesn't sound like it'll be very effective though.   Pomodoro technique. COLORS. Use a lot of colors to keep yourself interested. I really liked color coding my notes in lecture as the professor spoke. It helped me organize the information, and it made it easier to look back at notes later too.  Switching pen colors gave me enough of an opportunity to let my mind wander that I could focus back in relatively quickly. I would recommend these pens: http://www.amazon.com/Stabilo-Point-Pen-Sets-rollerset/dp/B000WGWJL0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1455692998&sr=8-2&keywords=stabilo+pens
and for reading these highlighters, they aren't too intense and distracting: http://www.amazon.com/Zebra-MILDLINER-WKT7-5C-WKT7-5C-RC-WKT7-5C-NC/dp/B00MTIGBT0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455693143&sr=8-1&keywords=mildliners
Those things really helped me, I mostly tried to make my notes as fun and entertaining to me as possible.  Since I'm a visual learner, I invested in a white board and would write down information over and over until I absorbed it. With the colors and the writing it kept my hands busy and moving so I was able to focus better. Also I would isolate myself in the basement of my library (usually after working out) and didn't leave until I finished what I needed to. When I finally let myself leave I would reward myself with something substantial.  If I needed to read something horribly boring (like a really dense research paper) I would actually read it while walking on the treadmill, or if I was in a pretty private place put on some fun instrumental music that I could kind of move to while studying (The mix-up by The Beastie Boys, most anything by Gorillaz or Nine Inch Nails, and Chinoiseries by Onra are some of my favorites). 
I just graduated college (finally) and these methods seriously helped me get my studying together my last 2 years after slacking in the studying department for my first 2. I really hope this helps! Good luck! I have been diagnosed as a kid, my mother refused to give me medication (which I am quite happy about, esspecially because it somehow worked out in the end). A friend of mine with ADHD (who is taking medication) suggested seeing a doctor and maybe even taking medication, since it helped her. I have take Ritalin before, I am absolutly certain that my productivity would through the roof if I took it, but it's still a drug, I suppose any person on stimulants achieves better workresults. I have worked as a firstaid instructor before and got massive problems when I had to do the 
pre- and postprocessing of the courses. My boss really hated me for all the minor mistakes I had made in the hourlong copy-paste work and I was so mad that a person could be retarted enough to accept this kind of work and actually do it correctly that I quit. I'd rather clean the streets or chop wood all day, than this kind of shit. Well, now I'm studying in hope of finding a job that will stimulate me, but I am facing the same problems with learning here. Maybe medication is worth another thought, but I wouldn't want to go to a psychologist, this seems a bit over the top. I feel like I'd sit there and the guy would be just like "So you want exactly what?" "Oh well ou know I have trouble focussing and it is really affecting my workflow and I though i might see a psychologist and well I hope that you could help me with my concentration issue" "hahaha, really? Seriously dude get your shit together its not that hard, write a list or some shit I don't know, now fuck off, this is not a real problem. Martha, send in the borderliner please" and I'm just there like 'Yeah, well okay' and settle down as a homeless beggar instead. I really don't trust ADHD diagnosis anyway, ADHD are also the symptoms of lazy fucked up people. So eventually 90% of the people with ADHD don't have a genetic disposition, but are just lazy people fucked up by modern entertainment and technology, me propably included. Wow, wow, I wanted to look up for solutions before starting to learn and now spend 5 minutes looking for my coffee mug and 10 reading and writing hahaha. Are you taking medication? Does it help? Any negative sideeffects? Will you get addicted/dependent to/on the drug?

Yeah okay, I had this silly therapist as a kid, who would suggest writing a check-list with things I have/want to do throughout the day and mark it with the exact time I plan doing it, so this is propably what you are suggesting too. Fair enough, might work, didnt do that for like... 6 years now?


 Nice, will do.

 Colors, library, working out and yeah that moving while learning is quite great too. I thought about sound recording while rereading my lectures (talking out loud, cursing at the paper and asking dumb questions actually helps me focus) and play the recordings instead of music while at the rowing mashine or running or the crosstrainer.

Thanks for the tips, I will esspecially try the color one, but since I enjoy drawing, I feel like I will find a better purpose for them than constructing silly words throughout my lectures. I know it's a little cliche to say, but people with ADHD are less likely to trust authority figures, and we are a little more stubborn. I really hate taking medication, but if you find the right one for you, it really does help.  I found that when I started consistently taking medication, it kind of just trained my brain to be more organized and proactive.  Now even when I'm not on my medication I can kind of overcome and suppress my more ADHD traits (this might be because I'm just getting older and more mature too).  The side effects suck a lot, but there are ways to counteract them.  I wouldn't recommend it for everyone (and I live in Colorado so it is legal) but I did smoke weed at night to help. It gave me a break, stimulated my appetite, made it easier to sleep, and gave me motivation to get my homework and studying done. I know I don't want to be on medication my whole life, and I chose a career path that allows me to work with my hands and interact with people instead of sitting at a desk, but unfortunately for now medication is the thing that helps me keep myself moving forwards.  Everyone has their thing they have to overcome, and it's not a cop-out if you need a little extra help through medication to get through our "one size fits all" school system that's kind of a piece of shit to start out with. 

I also do use long term and short term checklists, and a detailed planner that includes weekly and monthly views to keep myself organized. I don't use the exact time though, I allow myself to do stuff in the order I want to, that's a little too rigid for me.  I include more stuff than I know I'm going to get done too, just so those things I know I need to eventually get done loom over me, and so I don't feel bad if I don't get to everything.  About everybody benefiting from meds, there's studies that show that people with ADHD benefit substantially but people without ADHD don't.  The latter perceive a benefit but in testing there are negligible differences for people without ADHD.

I would HIGHLY recommend getting a copy of **"Driven to Distraction"** by **Dr. Edward Hallowell**.  It goes over a lot of what you're talking about and I think it will help.  Many people are on the fence about even seeking diagnosis because we chalk it up to "lack of willpower" or "laziness."  We **assume others won't take it seriously** or **we'll look like we're making excuses** or **we're taking the easy way out**.  
&nbsp;  
And it's not like that at all.  It's a **biological condition due to lack of dopamine in your brain**.  The analogy I like to use diabetes.  If **someone has diabetes, would anyone deny them insulin?**  No one would say "you're being lazy" or "it's a willpower thing, just make more insulin" or "you should know how important your blood sugar is, why can't you keep it in check?!"  The talent and will and ability may be there but if you're held back by your brain's chemistry, you won't be able to apply it.  It's like trying to run a 7 minute mile all your life then finding out that not everyone else is handicapped by wearing a shirt that weighs 10 pounds.  
&nbsp;  
And if you go to a **psychiatrist** or **psychologist** **experienced in ADD**, you won't see that stigma or assumption about seeking meds.  If it's ADD, it is real.  It is a problem. Misdiagnosis/overdiagnosis can happen (and there is abuse of meds out there) but if you go to a good doctor, you can avoid that.   
&nbsp;  
**And your problem is not any less important** than another person's  anxiety or borderline or anorexia.  If it's screwing with school and your career, then it's serious and should be looked at.  Dr. Hallowell talks about those doubts in his book and they are damaging because they prevent people from getting treatment that can help them.

I recently was diagnosed and started medication and it has helped.  It's also led to identifying other family members who may have it where it's negatively affected social life and careers (ie. lots of strain in relationships, lost jobs, etc.).  For me, **medication has helped me concentrate** because even though I am smart, **I can't sit myself down to do things**.  Boring or tedious things are anathema to me.  Professional school is interesting and fun for me so long as something holds my interest but trying to study for the boards exam that's 3 months away was impossible.  
&nbsp;  
Medication has helped me get back on track so even if memorizing a chart is boring as all hell, I **don't feel like I want to jump out of my chest** or walk away to **do something else, ANYTHING ELSE**.  Before, I just couldn't stomach the feeling of sitting there and doing it.  I think you know what I mean by that feeling lol.  But **with medication, it's not any more appetizing** but combined with scheduling and organization, **I can at least do it**.  It's possible.  
&nbsp;  
And as my psychiatrist put it: **organizational skills without treating the underlying biological problem won't do shit**.  You bring the focus and concentration closer to normal levels and now you can put those check lists and such to work.  Otherwise, you're like one of those lawn sprinklers that is just bursting in all different directions or desperate to do "anything but this." I have done some research and I experience no problems supressing inappropriate emotions, so maybe I might just be a lazy slob.

I used to smoke weed a lot too, when I was a teen, don't plan on doing this now anyway, but I get your point. Alcohol and Nicotine are helping aswell, even though they are potentially more harmful.
I wil propably check out a professional, to see if it helps. my insurance will pay for it, so I have basicly nothing to loose, but I will still feel like a total moron.

Wait... you put mor estuff on your list than you can manage, so you don't feel bad when you cant do it all? haha, thats actually rather complex. Well, this is rather convincing, I might/should propably see a psychologist, even though I am quite anxious about it (and even though its fucking hard to get an appointment here). Definitely do it!  I wish you the best of luck.
