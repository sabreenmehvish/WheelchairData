How do you instinctively sort things? Not sure if this is ADHD-related or not. I teach music lessons, and the mom at one of the lessons bought new lesson binders for her kids with clear colors. I asked one of the kids, "Where's your binder? The white one?" (I'd seen it maybe 2 times before.) The mom said, "Wow, you remember what color it is?" I shrugged, but inside I was thinking, "How could I NOT remember what color it is?" 

I couldn't find my new thermometer (always losing those things) because it was white with green accents, and I thought they were blue. I found it on top of a green book after giving up...

I wonder if this could be used to help me keep track of non-physical things, like tasks. 

**TL;DR: How does your brain naturally latch onto things? Color? Shape? Size? Time?** I will do this too. "It's blue with a black stripe." Search for hours, probably touching it multiple times, then give up. My wife finds it the instant she comes home, it wasn't blue.

The worst for me is anything at eye level. I'm 2m tall, so I'm the one sent to search shelves. I can be staring right at the object, but won't recognize it. In piles, on the floor.
 My memory seems best when used in conjunction with a location.

Inbgeneral though, my sorting is new ontop of old. Colour & sometimes size! Color coding, it a legit( unless color blind?). I've experienced same thing. That too
