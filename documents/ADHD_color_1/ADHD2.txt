Is it possible to succeed unmedicated? inb4 OF COURSE! Big pharma just wants your $$!!

I was taken off my ADHD meds about a year ago because they were exacerbating and possibly causing manic episodes for me which isn't a good thing. 

I've been getting by with coffee and energy drinks which aren't great for me but keep me from falling asleep at work. If I don't have my 240mg caffeinated energy drink before my shift, I'm done for.

What I'm worried about now is I'm going back to college next spring, and I won't have meds to help me this time. Basically, is there anything I can do so I can not fail next semester? I'm kind of worried.

Thanks. You're going to have to really make some serious adjustments with your living schedule.

I just recently got back on ADHD medication but, I spent almost 4 years without them and I'm about to graduate so I have quite a few tips that might help you.

• **DO NOT PROCRASTINATE**

It was literally hard for me to read one chapter of 30 pages, it would take me like, 3-4 hours to read a chapter from start to finish, and even before I started reading the chapter, it would take me like an hour or two beforehand to get my mind into a zone-like state of peace where I can finally hyper focus onto the textbook. Even then, I kept getting distracted and kept getting off task. I realized that procrastination was not going to be my friend then if this was the case. Unfortunately, I don't have the privilege to cram the night before and actually succeed in class.

If you have a chapter you have to read, make sure you start on that DAYS beforehand, heck maybe even a week or two. Just be ahead of the schedule, it will benefit a lot. Do not wait until last minute. Get your assignments done the moment they are available to be taken.

&#x200B;

• **ONLINE CLASSES**

Consider taking online classes. It helps a lot because being in person at class sucks since hearing someone lecture can sometimes make you sleepy or sometimes you'll zone out while the professor is talking and you'll miss what they said. Heck, and sometimes it just sucks because you just can't seem to connect the dots of what the professor said and what he means by what he said. I've gotten myself into trouble a few times from asking the professor to repeat himself over and over.  I spoke to my school adviser and had her register me as an Online Student and my life has been way better ever since. Online classes became my best friend because I would make use of PowerPoints, the textbook, and any Youtube tutorials that I could pause, fast forward, or rewind at my leisure to fully understand something. Professors usually just repeat what is on their PowerPoint lectures anyways so you wont miss out on anything.

&#x200B;

• **NOTES/NOTE STRUCTURE**

When taking notes for class, I highly suggest that you hand write your notes, and if you can't hand write them and you need to type your notes, then take the time to make your notes look aesthetically pleasing.

I found that when I made my notes look extra organized and structured (kinda like how I made this comment look) it made my note taking experience so much better because it also for some reason helped me really retain all the information from my notes. I guess it just makes it more easy for me to truly remember and learn something because of how easy it is to find the information I need. It's so well indexed.

&#x200B;

• **GET A PLANNER & COLOR CODING**

Like, don't use your phone to plan your stuff. Get a physical planner you can write on (The ones where you can write Weekly/Daily activities on is nice), and get some colored pens to distinguish which class has something due.

&#x200B;

*For example:*

*-Class A: Written in Green.*

*-Class B: Written in Blue.*

*-Class C: Written in Red.*

*-Class D: Written in Orange.*

*-Tests (Whichever test, they're all frickin' important let's give them their own color lol): Written in Black.*

*-Personal Errand: Written in Purple.*

&#x200B;

Seeing all the different colors helped me a lot with not getting overwhelmed with reading so much when I was looking to see what was due for a specific class.

• **CONCLUSION**

Hopefully these tips help you. Of course, I can't guarantee that this will magically make your school experience a breeze. It's hard. I have had quite a few panic attacks at the stress of trying to get it together. But organization does definitely help make the experience as easy going as possible while we're unmedicated. I wish you the best! So you just switched from drug?

Instead of regulated "methylphenidate", you're now taking unregulated "methyltheobromine"\* by drinking large amounts of Energy Drinks and Coffee. With the argument that Big Pharma wants your dollars.

In my personal opinion drinking Energy Drinks and coffee would be even worse than taking ADHD medicine. It's even so bad that you have figured out you need 240mg of Caffeinated energy drink before your shift to function properly. 1 Red Bull Energy Drink contains 75mg Caffeine. That means you're drinking more than 3 Energy Drinks before your shift. That's so incredibly bad for your brain, liver and kidneys.

Besides that, don't you think the Coffee and Energy Drink companies don't want your $$? Does drinking 3 Energy Drinks do less harm than taking a prescribed regulated well tested medicine?

If Caffeine is helping you, that's awesome of course. But maybe talking to your doctor about this would be great because **Caffeine is not a safe drug,** it causes: Bone density loss, Panic Attacks, Miscarriages, Increased blood pressure and [many other bad side effects](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#6). If Methylphenidate is possibly the cause of manic episodes, maybe learning copings strategies would be a better idea than screaming like an Anti-Vaxxer that "Big Pharma wants your $$".

^(\*Methyltheobromine is a different name for Caffeine. I used this name to point out the fact that both are stimulating drugs. Even with "Methyl" in there names. Don't get me wrong, I also drink large amounts of Coffee a day. But just because I like it, not because it treats symptoms. If that was the case I would have talked with my doctor about Methylphenidate.)  Talk to disability services at your school about getting accommodations. They make you jump through a lot of hoops but it'll help. For sure. Takes you 3-4 months to recover once you get off a drug like Adderall (like my case), and after that you get by like a relatively normal person again. During that come off though I needed coffee just to function in the morning, it’s pretty bad for a few months, you just feel like shit.

After that life goes back to normal though. You’ll probably never be super focused most of your life, but that’s ok. It’s part of how we are. Once you’re done with school and specifically studying, you’ll realize that ADD is not the worst thing in the world. I can think of a lot of benefits to it. In fact I think of it as more of a personality type, and not a disorder. Pros and cons, like everything else in life. Yes, but it IS difficult.

I went all through university without ADHD meds. 
I survived on coffee, 7-eleven slushies and doing my homework in the computer labs straight after classes finished.

I didn't realise I had ADHD at the time, but later on I realised that if I put in my headphones, listened to music without lyrics and sat in the computer labs to get homework completed: I would be able to get it done quite easily because the knowledge from classes was still present and "I would have to do the work sometime so I may as well get it out of the way ahead of time".

If you get homework or assignments; do them straight after the classes or straight after classes finish for the day. Listen to music without lyrics (lyrics distract) and get something into you that will get you past the starting hurdle, i.e. coffee or something sweet (which your brain identifies as a reward).
  Yes, if regular sleep becomes your number one priority.   This was really comprehensive. Thanks! Please give me any tip on how to beat procrastination. I am medicated and it is great but my procrastination is a problem that I personally have to deal with.

I want to have a mindset and a view on life that finds doing productive stuff rewarding.
I am tired that the urge to play games or talk to friends very often overrides cleaning, cooking proper meals and doing eventual homework. I need something to constantly remind me of this new mindset I want to take on.  I wasn't "screaming like an anti-vaxxer". I was mocking them. Thank you for the information, however. I am well aware of the risks. This!! Try to see them as soon as possible in the semester so they can help you set a schedule that works for you! Besides that, I hear exercise and eating well work wonders. If you can also get someone to cheer you on it helps a ton since it gives some outward motivation. If you can't find someone then my friend said she got to know her profs well because then she wouldn't want to disappoint them and it would help her get more interested in the subject matter.  Tbh. That’s a tough one. There’s no immediate cure to procrastination.
 
You have to train your mind to do an assignment as soon as it’s available to take, and study the moment you’re told on the syllabus that you need to study a specific chapter.

The planner & color coding tip will work wonders with this. If you can take the time to sit down, and plan our your week’s worth of assignments and studying, it makes it easier to follow through because you can literally see on paper what exactly it is you need to do. 

Also just plan one week at a time. Don’t start planning a whole month out, that will mess you up. Just one week at a time to keep on track. 

Also being ADHD, it does not help to do part of an assignment one day, and do another part of the assignment on another. Once you start an assignment, just focus on that one thing until it is done and then move on to your next objective. Don’t break it apart because then you can forget to finish. Just get it done.

Hopefully this helps. Aahhh okay, that “wooshed” over my head haha. You’re welcome! If you’re well aware of the risks, why don’t you talk with your doctor about your extremely bad caffeine intake? Liver cancer, braincell damage and failing kindeys is something I rather don’t talk about with him lol It helps, I will try to plan and color code. Planning sounds fun, and I have never really done it before, maybe that is why I struggle so much.

And I have personally learned that breaking stuff up in parts doesn't work so well haha.

Thanks man I have mentioned it to my therapist and psychiatrist, but my PCP doesn't know. Maybe I should.  Nurse here: dude, tell your doctor. I get the whole fear of feeling judged and yeah, it's a legitimate concern. However, our job is to help you manage your health safely. 

&nbsp;

Honestly, if anything, I'm super grateful when my patients tell me something like that. I can plan ahead and anticipate possible issues that may develop because of the thing they told me as well as avoid treatments that may not be the best option because of their health history. I'll be sure to inform them the next time I see them in that case. I always make sure they're aware of anything that's going on. I just didn't think the caffeine thing was something worth bringing up. I guess I was wrong. Thanks for the heads up. No worries. 80% of my job is to educate people. If it's going in your body, it's going to affect your body. Your doctor saying, "XYZ is fine," is much better than you saying, "oh shit, I didn't think XYZ could do that."


I'd rather know too much about your bodily functions than too little, y'know?
