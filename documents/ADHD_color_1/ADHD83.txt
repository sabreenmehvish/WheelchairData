ADHD Awareness Color I was wondering if anyone knows what color the ADHD Awareness Ribbon is. I've found conflicting colors. Let's just change it every five minutes! I did not realize that ADHD had one. Just looked it up and apparently it's orange.  "What color did we decide that ribbon was again?"

"Shit, I'm not sure. Let's just say _____ and roll with it." I find orange distracting.. ALL THE COLORS!!!!!!  Orange, hmmm..the prison color?? I protest, I'd prefer "rescue green" or Pacific Ocean blue , please. come on people...lets be honest with our selves... If we even remembered to get around to making a ribbon we would never get around to coloring it! Then even if we did color it we would misplace it every 5 minutes! 

Although...if we did all decide to get together to decide we would probably get like 500 other things that are really cool half done! The two most common colors I've seen are orange, and purple. 

As a big fan of the Percy Jackson books, this amuses me greatly.
