How do you explain ADD/ADHD to others? Heres how I do it. more details in comments  I saw a post like this recently but it was entirely visual (and spot on I might add). I began thinking about it. Everyone jokes about --SQUIRREL!!!! but for me thats precisely what its like yet it feels like a punchline. I remember how hard it was for my wife to explain her ailments until we cant across butyoudontlooksick.com and the spoon theory, and that helped tremendously. thinking about that other post inspired me to do something similar but with words, because for most folk, thoughts are nothing but words, and for me its an 80 car pile of up of words.

I'm wondering what anyone thinks of my attempt, and if any of you have ways of explaining/demonstrating it to others. I look at it this way: the mind is like a mirror when you're taking a shower. A normal person's mind is clear; like the mirror before the shower. A person with ADHD's mind is so cloudy and overrun with thoughts that you can't see through it, like the immediately post-shower mirror. There are small things we can do to help, like totally isolating ourselves in order to, say, start a project, that are like wiping the mirror clear. It only fogs up again shortly after. But, if we take our meds, it's like we let the room air out, and the mirror is totally clear again, like a normal person's brain. I like the Russell Barkley explanation that it's like being short-sighted in time.

Imagine a severely short-sighted person without their glasses on.  The thing they need to see is on a huge billboard.  Everyone else can see it but to them it's such a vague blur that they can't even begin to understand it and therefore don't even try to.  It only becomes clear once they're standing right in front of it.  Now transplant that from space to time.  Until that important time is right upon you it's just a vague blur, not even worth thinking about.

Another way I like to think of this is that I have no internal calender.  If you tell me something is happening two weeks from now, I don't have the capacity to store that anywhere specific in my mind.  It just floats about in the mist (and probably gets lost).  The same could be said of short-term things too.  I know my dinner is in the oven and needs to be checked on but I don't have something concrete to hang that on so, short of timing it exactly and staring at the clock (from which I will undoubtedly get distracted as soon as I look away), that too just falls away into the mist.

Of course this is only an explanation of one aspect of ADHD.  As for how my mind actually feels second-by-second, I don't really know.  I suppose it's like a shelf that can only hold one thing at a time.  Put something new up to look at and the previous thing gets knocked off.

 The way that I try to explain it is like this:

It's kind of like watching a youtube video for a few seconds, and then finding an interesting video on the side that's been suggested to you by YouTube, and then watching that video for a few seconds, until you find another video. And this just keeps happening until you reach that weird part of YouTube.

I like to explain it this way, because a lot of people can relate to it (I mean who hasn't ended up on the weird part of youtube?). Although it might not be a 100% accurate description, it provides other people with a general idea of how my mind works all the time oh my god auto correct and I'm on my mobile. should read **the extent to which they interfere with everyday life** I just started the book 'driven to distraction' and think this quote is maybe not do creative but simple: 

'Where does the [ADD] syndrome begin and normal behaviour leave off? What is impulsivity? What is distractibility? How much is too much energy? Considering the symptoms, can't we all recognise parts of ourselves? Yes, however it's not the presence of symptoms, but the **severity, duration, and the extent to which they I therefore with everyday life**'
 [deleted] I have two analogies that I like to use. The first is short and to the point, but I like the second one better, for reasons that will become obvious.

The first:

Have you ever seen someone so captivated by a TV show that they seem to be completely unaware of their surroundings? My own thoughts hold me captive in the same way. As much control as you have over the plot of a riveting TV or movie, I have over the direction of my own thoughts. Whatever is the most interesting direction for the plot/thought is, that's where it goes. 

And the second:

Trying to organize my thoughts into a logical progression is like trying to stack a dozen puppies into a 3x4 puppy-wall. Just as the puppies are not properly shaped for stacking (or stationary enough to even try), so are my thoughts not "shaped" for traditional linear order, or even of tangible enough dimensions to sort. -But they are comparably "wiggly" and whimsical. 

Even if you try your hardest to build that darned puppy-wall, you can't hold them all still at once. Most will immediately escape the moment you move on to wrangle the next one, wreaking adorable havoc with each other. You'd be lucky to get more than two in sequence at a time. (These puppies never sleep, by the way.) The ensuing chaos will be entertaining enough that playing with the individual puppies and enjoying the fleeting attention they unpredictably sporadically give is the most you can hope for. So it is with my thoughts. They trample each other, make urgent sounding pleas for attention, run away, return with random artifacts from around the room, and generally just do everything except what you want them to. Am I talking about my thoughts or the puppies now? Indeed. 

To make the analogy any more accurate would also make it less real-life applicable. If the puppies are really to represent my thoughts and impulses, they would have to occasionally blip out of existence at random intervals, and sometimes be replaced with kittens. Oh, and the kittens can fly. And sing show tunes. 

tl;dr: My thoughts are wiggly puppies.   I explain it to people like it's Thanksgiving Dinner. You get a full plate of food and instead of eating just one thing until it's gone you just take little bites of everything before you get to full to eat them. I say
"It's as if my mind is a seedy dandelion on a breezy day"

The second link....damn, if it isn't spot on. You have at least six (special) decks of cards, in at least three different face-colors .  The color represents the 'project' -- different shades of the same color might be different projects in the same category, where the categories are things like 'work' or 'home'.  The number or value of the card represents the priority.  You write on the back for the details of the task.

Everyone starts with all the cards on an otherwise clear desktop.  For most people it's easy to sort them by category or project, at the same time seeing the priority since color and number are on the same side, and then can rather quickly start addressing the tasks.  

With ADHD, the colors and the priorities are on opposite sides of the card, AND someone switched on a giant fan before you finished labeling them, so you have to grab them from the air, running around to chase the one you *think* is "go to the dentist at 2p", but it tumbles through the air and crosses paths with another "king" and you're not sure which one you were chasing, so you follow one that turns out to be "pick the baby up from daycare at 5p" and forgetting the dentist.  Maybe on the way you've picked up a few other cards, but by now your day is over, so you only have six sorted cards (under a paperweight) to start with your next day, and many of the remaining cards never got their task-labels, or you were in such a hurry, they went in the wrong category or the wrong priority.  

You know you didn't achieve what your peers did in the same day, so you lie awake at night trying to mentally sort it all out, but without the cards to write on and sort, you keep going in interlocking circles.  You don't get enough sleep, you rush in the morning, and barely arrive in time, still feeling groggy and confused, which *further* slows your progress. Needs more swearing other than that it's spot on for me.  I cannot stop thinking about this. I'd like to propose a slightly different theory for people with ADHD, it's the dollar cost theory. Because people who have ADHD deal with the same kinds of things that people without ADHD deal with, it just costs them more.

Say you start the day with $20.

No ADHD: 

* Getting up in the morning, getting to work on time $1
* Remembering to make your lunch and bring it with you: $0.50
* Answering all your new email: $2
* Getting started on a project that isn't due for six weeks: $1
* Finishing same project with 12 hours remaining: $500
* Answering voicemail: $0.25/message
* Cooking supper after work: $3
* Washing and putting away the dishes: 2

ADHD:

* Getting up in the morning, getting to work on time $10
* Remembering to make your lunch and bring it with you: $5
* Answering all your new email: $50
* Getting started on a project that isn't due for six weeks: $10,000
* Finishing same project with 12 hours remaining: $5
* Answering voicemail: $2.50/message
* Cooking supper after work: $20
* Washing and putting away the dishes: $50

Needs some fine-tuning but you get the point. It kind of helps explain the question: "Why haven't you started on that project yet?"  Um, because I can't afford it? Same project different cost.

[edit] aw, thanks for the gold! > spoon theory

Just read this.

Wow. And why are there streaks on the mirror? When was the last time I wiped the mirror? Was I trying to see myself in the mirror? Because it's only a tiny streak circle. I remember the last time, yes, I was checking my hair. It wasn't dry. I need to dry my hair. This mirror is too foggy to see if my hair is dry. Those streaks are annoying. I should wipe them off.

 That's a good analogy. I actually do that when watching you tube. I don't think i've ever actually listened to a song to completion in years as well. TIL At age 27 I qualify as an older fucker.  brilliant. wonderful adaptation
 very nice. I like this a lot. EXACTLY!! Thank you. It came to me one night as my meds were kicking in and one of my professors in college was asking what it's like and how she could help me do better in class. [deleted] We had Lucy on Nick at Nite. For some circles on Reddit, that's *really fucking old* Accurate if the chocolate represents my thoughts. Eating the chocolates and stuffing them down my blouse would be my feeble attempts at concentrating.
