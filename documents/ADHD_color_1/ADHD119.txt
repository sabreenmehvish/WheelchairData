Why is it easier to retain information by writing it down over and over rather than reading it over and over? I know this isn't the universal case with ADHD, but I never realized how many people study best using this method. How does it work? And why is it harder for individuals with ADHD, even with medication, to retain what they are reading on a page? This seems like something interesting, so if theres any links you might have that shares why please share it! From a high level : Reading is passive input, Writing is active output.  

Reading creates a partial image in our mind, but we are very prone to unconsciously skip over parts of the text we don't fully understand, as well as fill in any gaps with our imagination.

Writing forces us to use a part of our brain that makes it hard to move on if we don't actually understand the concept we're writing down.  

Think of it like telling a story.  Hearing someone tell you a story, you are reconstructing the image and filling in any gaps on your own.  When you're the one telling the story, you already have the full image in your brain and are relaying that outward. When you're reading something, you're just reading it, but when you write it, not only are you writing it, but the process of writing something first requires you to construct what you're about to write inside your mind.  If what you're writing is something you read instead of your own construction then you are basically re-reading what you read before, even if its just you recalling what you read from memory (which was the entire goal from the beginning).  I hope that made some sense. I like to use multicolored pens when writing, it gives the writing another dimension and allows for easily locating important concepts/ideas as I reserve a special color just for that (I've graduated past the standard 4 color pen :P )
Be warned though, you might end up debating with yourself as to what color to use for what thing, and that can eat up time like NOM NOM NOM. I prefer writing. I'm putting some degree of thought into evaluating and ordering the information that i'm receiving. That process, is what helps fix ideas more firmly in my mind, leading to greater recall down the line. It boosts my memory and the ability to understand concepts and facts, especially when its repetitive.

If i happen to read something, **Highlighter** always! Visually i need to color code to determine whats highly important ( ^green ), additional facts ( ^yellow ) and good to know ( ^pink ). Two pages in a book, i forget what i've read since my ADHD doesn't allow me to absorb the information. Color coding helps me remember the main topics rather than reading over and over to finally comprehend it. So I'm the sad combination of ADHD and dysgraphic (basically writing by hand is time-consuming and arduous). With that in mind, does anyone know if one gets similar benefits from typing? Or would it behoove me to spend the time and do it by hand?  In literacy tutoring orientation the teacher explained the basics of audio, visual and kinesthetic learning, and how to use all three inputs to help students learn, so if I want to remember something, I'll say it aloud while writing it.  SEE the words as you write them.  HEAR the words as you speak them.  FEEL the words being formed as symbols by your hand and as sounds formed by your larynx.  Namaste. It has nothing to do with ADHD, the same benefits and problems exist for most people.

You are thinking of this in the wrong way.  Different parts of the brain process different types of information just like the vision recognition part of the brain is different than the smelling or taste sensing part of the brain.

Now the sensing part of the brain is different than the, data extraction, identification, and data utilization part of the brain.  Different people can have different strengths or less strength/weakness in particular areas.  In addition different gene versions aka genetics can allow for greater strengths in various areas but it is not just genetics for there are a lot of complicated inputs and environmental effects.

For example with reading, your brain first must identify the characters aka the symbols with the vision part of the brain.  Another part of the brain actually sequences the inputs so you can tell which letters are in front or back up or down from another.  Another part of the brain translates this vision into something called glyphs, glyphs which are normally associated with the thought of magic or runes are how your body identify symbols, this symbolt represents a thought or idea that there is a connect even though on the face of it does not make sense.  Another part of the brain then translated the various thoughts and ideas to create a narrative story.

Different brain areas are used completely for writing vs reading. For example besides obtaining raw data of position and letters your brain has to remember where you are and where things like your hand movements are for this information to be useful.  Your brain purposefully stores this information for often location data and sequential data on how you perform a deed had evolutionary advantages on refinding food and other benefits in your environment, as well as benefits on you learning skills by remembering how you did something. Aka the reason why humans are one of the few species that have a very large brain development after birth, we exist with a brain that is mean to be smaller while passing through your mother's womb but to get a lot bigger so you have to potential to learn, followed by you pruning the raw potential to form a useful potential brain that learns the most efficent way possible in the first five years of life.

&nbsp;

One thing that is different about writing and reading is you have to know how the story ends before your brain converts the ideas, to words, and then words to glyphs, and then the glyphs to hand movements.  It has to already make sense for your brain what you want to say and your brain ponders on it longer before the process is finished.

This is why writing is often easier for remember as in to learn for most people.  Not just with ADHD but with most people overall.  That said this is often and not always more easy to learn via this method.  Due to different skills using different combination of brain areas to be performed sometimes other people learn easier via different sensory methods.

It is often connected with adhd due to the working memory buffer problem that all people experience with reading, and the buffer size is different for each person.  WIth all people that info has to be retained while you convert vision to glyphs and glyphs to ideas and  ideas to grammar and concept so you can sequence the ideas.

That said with other people writing is pure hell and we get stucked in the sequencing and creating part of the info and it is like a traffic jam in our buffer area of the brain.  With me writing while there is a lot of change that is occurring at once like writing notes in class while listening is too much info not enough time to think and listen before my buffer is overloaded and I fall behind. My now adult daughter has some dyslexia, mostly sequencing and decoding issues. When she was in grade school she had an ADD component which was explained as essentially boredom because the things she was looking at didn't make sense to her.

The reading lab teacher, whom I have since nominated for sainthood, described various methods of learning/retention that are specific to each individual. It can be a combination of visual, aural, mechanical, repetitive, a combination of the sources and occasionally some weird stuff like olfactory ( a bottle of rosewater open when  acquiring new information  may make it easier to recall  when you smell the scent again. I don't like rosewater, but you get the idea. Whatever works.).

My daughter eventually learned what her learning pattern and style were and made it through middle school and high school with some support from special ed teachers and then through a college in business with a 4 year degree done in 4 years.

We used a behavioral model that involved support from us as parents, classroom teachers and the special ed group(all in a public school district in the US) and were able to avoid medication.

From a different perspective, I went to law school in the mid 1970's, before computer technology. My friends had their own reading and retention patterns. Some read stuff out loud to themselves for aural  reinforcement of visual input ( in a study group, they were the ones muttering to themselves, though with intent and purpose). I need to hear and take handwritten notes: aural reinforced by mechanical. One friend taped the lectures and played the cassettes over and over under her pillow at night as she was going to sleep. I don't know if any of us had ADD issues; no one showed the HD type of behavior although there were  at least two guys who seemed to be stoned in class ( no joke). Each finished school and passed teh bar, so whatever their approach was, it worked for them.

My point is that information retention issues are not confined to ADHD people or even ADD people and that there are modalities and strategies in the Learning Disability/Dyslexia fields which can be adopted and adapted to individual needs. what I gathered from one particular book I read (one of the authors was a neurologist) is that you have different memory systems in your brain that correspond to different sorts of input systems.  the more different systems you use, the better the information is retained.  One of those systems is "kinesthetic" -- i.e., it is based on your own motor movements.  that's the one you are using when you are writing information out.  but there were other kinds -- I guess visual, auditory, tactile, I can't remember them all.  they said the more different systems you use, the stronger your memory will be.  EDIT:  meant to link to the book, it was this one:  https://books.google.com/books?id=nTiZAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT87&dq=eide+kinesthetic+memory&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIoLfq_anDyAIVUOxjCh20uwJf#v=onepage&q=eide%20kinesthetic%20memory&f=false This answer is based more on myself but I noticed sometimes if I'm reading I may skip over important information or I feel like I'm reading but not really paying attention and understanding what it is that I'm reading. I'm fairly certain that this is a result of ADHD since when I'm on my medication I can read fairly well and quickly too. I have always used writing things down as a study method.

By reading, I simply forget what I read last minute. I think this has more to do with learning styles than ADHD. I had to take a 'how to learn in college' class and was told that form of studying is useful for me because I'm a kinesthetic learner. Perhaps people with adhd are more likely to be kinesthetic because its more active rather than passive which allows us to keep better focus. So it this the case for both ADHD and non-ADHD people?  I completely agree with this. My new method of studying for this semester is outlining every chapter we go over at least once or twice. Been getting A's on my tests, even on my last test and the average for the class was a 57. I do something similar when I take notes. I use symbols and a bullet point format. For example, a square is for a new concept/topic, a dash is for a definition or fact about said topic,  a circle is for a concept within the square, and a triangle is a class activity or discussion.

 I have a bit of (literal) OCD with my ADHD, so I always found highlighting stressful. I'm always stressed out that I'm either highlighting the wrong thing, not highlighting enough, or that I'll have missed something important and will miss it when studying because it isn't highlighted.  It sounds like the act of mentally processing it and then producing it to paper is the important part. Could you come up with some sort of  short hand or even pictures/symbols something easier than words and sentences. You don't necessarily go back and read these. The act of writing it is better than nothing. Regardless of studies/what other people are doing: If writing by hand is to hard and stressful and can't focus on the information you are supposed to be learning, then it isn't going to be beneficial. Worse, if you start to "put off" studying because the writing is stressful, then you aren't helping yourself at all.  
Condensing the information  and making study sheets (even by typing) is beneficial. Because you have to understand the info in order to reword it, decide how important it is, etc.  Studies comparing those who take notes by typing and those who handwrite them show the handwriting group retains knowledge better. 

http://m.pss.sagepub.com/content/25/6/1159 In regards to the stoners...  It was the 70's...  More serious, I have heard some recreational drugs can help ADHD, but never have i heard of Pot + ADHD, other than apetite... Yes. With ADHD, there's the added issue of constant distractibility / mind wandering while reading. Making it to the end of a page without rereading half the lines multiple times can be a real challenge in this regard.

In my experience, when I was in university, I would cope by:   
1) Reading summary points at the end of each chapter before reading the actual chapter.   
2) Use a Q-card to cover up sentences I'd already finished reading so that I couldn't instinctively look back and re-read (which was causing me massive slowdowns)   
3) Immediately after finishing a chapter, write down the concepts in as few bullet points as possible, where going from one point to the next forms an easily re-tellable story.    
4) Where possible, create acronyms to improve recall of related concepts, and memorize those. *Fun note on that front : Once managed to distill the entire content of a course into 6 acronyms; as soon as we started the exam I turned over the paper and wrote down them down -- I could then work my way through any question by flipping to the back and walking through the concepts.*
 Indeed. I completely understand! I was once OCD and felt the same exact way when i first started college (my textbook had every sentence highlighted), but it comes down to your mind. Understanding it and realizing what is needed to comprehend verses thinking what you wanted to know or assume is needed.  **EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT!**  Not a bad characteristic. Fortunately for me, i was able to get over that disorder and i am making the right decisions when it comes to the factor of focusing and studying. Once again, this is me personally. Others can disagree. Nobody will understand you, but yourself. Medication helps, but the responsibility is on your part, and i've done therapy which helped when i was 20 (now 25). You have to weigh on whats extremely important and whats not related to what you're studying. At the end of the day you have to trust yourself, and if you may be wrong... Hey... you made an attempt. Feel good about making the effort. Great thing about college is tutoring or asking the instructor whether you are in the right direction. Every course as a syllabus with whats needed to focus on. Try to worry less, and accept you're possibly in the right direction. ADHD is a gift and curse. Mostly your (at least mine) intuition is on point, but understanding and focusing will be difficult at times. It isn't easy. Hey, if highlighting stresses you out maybe it's not your type of brain function method. Whether university or local college, they're there to help you out and asking questions will never hurt (coming from someone with a anxiety disorder till this day). Worst case scenario your wrong on what you highlight, but best case is you have other students, your instructor and tutors. I felt ashamed to ask when i would ask for help, but now realize your better off asking than regret to ask at all. Everyone learns differently. Stressing causes more physical complications then you realize. Accept, understand, and ask questions. Life is short. Figure out what helps you, and always ask others about something you don't understand before a test/assignment is due. Wish you the best! Allegedly for people with hyperactivity, pot can make them do more normally and enable them to focus better. > Once managed to distill the entire content of a course into 6 acronyms; as soon as we started the exam I turned over the paper and wrote down them down -- I could then work my way through any question by flipping to the back and walking through the concepts.


I took and passed the bar examination essay test using that method. In 1978.

 Haven't heard that.  Usually cocaine...
