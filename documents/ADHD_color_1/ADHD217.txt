What to expect during assessment test? Hi reddit peeps, in short, I was referred to by a psychologist for a full ADHD assessment test by my psych doc. My question is this: What can I expect during this assessment (apparently about 2 hrs) test?

Let me clarify, I am NOT seeking advice on how to swing/insure a positive diagnosis, I just can't find much info on the interwebs about what to expect. From what I gather, and from what the psychologist has told me, it seems like there will be an interview, an IQ test (doc mentioned this, idk why it is necessary), adhd questionnaire, and some kind of computerized tests to "measure" the amounts I "don't pay attention".

Has anyone else on here ever had a long assessment test conducted like this? I would just like to go into my appointment with some knowledge about what will be asked/tested. 


Thanks! Wish I could help but I never had to go through hours of testing.

I do want to offer some sympathy though, I tried to ask this question myself (well, I asked what to expect during my first appointment) and people kept saying like "Don't worry about it, just be honest." But they were missing the point. Some people get anxious when they don't know what is coming. People don't like anxiety. There doesn't need to be another motive to wonder what's coming.

The idea of it being a "test" is frustrating though. People seeking a diagnosis will be scared to do too well on the test, and some will try to do bad, potentially distorting the results. Newly diagnosed here, if it is anything like what I went through, it is kind of boring and really not that big of a worry. At least in my case the therapist was pretty sure I was ADD 5-10 minutes into just conversing and me describing why I think I might have ADD, but I had to go through the test. There was a questionnaire portion and a computer portion. The computer portion took about 40 minutes, with a few different tests, but I was there about 2 hours total. 

A memory test, where you are shown 15 or so words, one at a time. Then you are shown a larger number of words and you hit spacebar when you see one you recognize. 

Others were things like, it shows a color name in a color font, hit spacebar if they match (color and name of color) other things are comparing shapes based on either color or shape depending on what it is asking for. (This one was the hardest for me) 

Over all, it is just trying to test how your brain works it seems, you get stats for how likely you are to have different conditions. On a scale from 0 - 300, apparently I rated a 236 for ADD. 

I spent hours the night before stressing over "But what if I test too well? I am smart and I might just do well because it is on a computer." 

My advice? Don't worry, there is nothing to freak out about. In my case, my family doc was comfortable prescribing for me without it, but my insurance requires it for new adult diagnosis of ADD. Anyway, take a breath, don't think too much about it if you can help it. Really it is nothing scary. Just be you and you will be fine. 2 hours seems awfully short. I took my assessment last month and it involved four sessions of about 3 hours each. I felt exhausted, they picked my brain over and over. I would go home and knock out. 

I recommend getting good rest and try your best. I learned so much about myself going through the assessment. Not only do you learn if you have adhd, but you also learn a lot about yourself. You learn your weaknesses and your strengths. 

Hopefully this helps.  The things I remember are:

- Conners continuous performance test (press space as fast as you can when any letter but X flashes, I took this bugger 3 times -.-)
- Remembering a drawing of different geometrical shapes
- Remember 5 letters and 5 numbers, and say the numbers in ascending order and then letters in alphabetical order
- Putting pins down into a metal plate as fast as you, where they only fit in a certain way (if that makes any sense) to test motor skills
- Say as many words starting with the letters s, t and k (pretty sure it's random :p)
- Computer test that tests your ability to learn on the fly, the program changes what's considered right and wrong many times during the examination.
- Reading color labels out loud (easy), reading the color that a word is written in, and not what it says (medium), reading the color a word is written in and not what it says, unless there's a box around the word, then you read what it actually says (hard as **** for me lol) 
- Other similar tests where they substitute letters for shapes and stuff like that.

Almost every test is timed. This is how he gauged the severity of your problems. I probably forgot half of the tests I went through because it took about 1.5 hours and I was there four sessions. 

The 'IQ' test for me was about 30 different progressive matrices, the purpose this test is to rule out any mental retardation and to give something to compare your other test scores to. You can have 150 IQ and still have ADHD, but your short term memory and other ADHD related shortcomings might be different to say if you had 75 IQ. 

The assessment is not definitive. Diagnosing ADHD is more of an diagnosis of exclusion because many other mental illnesses have the same symptoms. The assessment is a tool to find out where the shoe pinches, at least it should be. 

I've talked to many others about the testing, some went on to become engineers and others collecting welfare. None of them 'aced' the test. Some did 'better' than others, but there's no absolute answer after the assessment. There's a pretty lengthy written report with a conclusion. 

Imo the test is pseudo-science because they often find what they're looking for, but so is the rest of the diagnostic work. I wouldn't worry (although I did) because the tests are all relative to each other and most don't have a quantized yes/no system. I've yet to meet someone who have successfully influenced the results. Good luck, I found it kinda fun.
