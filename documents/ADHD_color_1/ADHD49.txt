How I'm using a bullet journal to help with my ADHD TL;DR:  Check out the photos to see how I use my bullet journal to help with my ADHD.  It mainly comes down to making a plan every day part of your routine, and making sure your bullet journal is really easy to use.

(I apologize if you've seen this before, I've posted it in some bullet journal subs)

Since recently being diagnosed with ADHD, I decided to really try and double down on creating and using a bullet journal.  If you'd like to learn more about what a bullet journal is, I highly suggest [watching this video](https://youtu.be/fm15cmYU0IM) but essentially, it's just a method of having a to-do list in a journal.

I had tried bullet journals before when I left school (the worked well for me in school) and while it was successful for about a week, after that it would often fade, so I wanted to try and design a bullet journal I'd actually stick with.  Here's the ideas I came up with to help with that:

#Requirements for my bullet journal

* **It needs to be small and portable.** If I consider leaving it home because it's "too big", then that bullet journal won't work.  So because of that, I got a small notebook that can fit in my back jeans pocket and fits very nicely in my purse.  My notebook is quite slim at ~60 pages (which means I go through a lot of them) and 3.5"x5"
* **It needs to be super easy to set up.** A lot of people do really artistic spreads, but that's not me, and comparing myself to that would mean I'm less likely to actually use it for productivity.  That also means that one color of pen needs to be enough
* **I need to make it part of my routine.** This was really the biggest thing.  Especially with how my life is right now, it's very unstructured.  So the biggest thing for me has been that my bullet journal is now part of my morning routine.  I've helped myself remember to do that through alarms on my phone

# My weekly spread

[So here is an example of my main spread.](https://i.imgur.com/YiFwQi8.jpg)  In bujo terms, this is a "weekly spread".  It's all the stuff I think of throughout the week that need to get done sometime that week.  A filled in box means it's done, a half filled box means half done, etc.  

A bullet point means it's an event.  You can see, for example that this week I had a D&D game on Sunday (oSu), one on Saturday (oS) and Therapy on next Wednesday (onW)

On the right is a list of all the dinners/suppers I have planed for the week.  I use this to create my grocery list (which is on an app in my phone).  If it's crossed out, we ate it.

Below that is tracking.  One of the things I've really been struggling with is basic hygiene - brushing my teeth everyday, etc.  So this helps me be more accountable for doing that and other task I want to do daily.  An X in the tracking means it wasn't applicable for the day.

#My daily spread

Like I mentioned before, every day I plan in my bullet journal by creating a daily to-do list.  [These are some examples of that.](https://i.imgur.com/WKVPABr.jpg)  You'll see I have some of the things in my tracker on my daily to-do lists.  These are the things I'm still having some trouble in 
doing daily reliably.  

The bullet points (for me) indicate an event.  When I plan my day, I look at my events (on my weekly spread) and write down any that happen that day.  I also look at the weekly list and determine which of those to-dos I'm going to do on that day.  (You may notice a slash in some of the boxes - those indicate that it's a task from the weekly list.)  

If I remember something that needs to be done during the day that wasn't previously on my lists, I'll also write that here.  If it's something that needs to happen sometime during the week but not today, I'll write it on my weekly spread.

I also have some notes that I jot down as I use this as my working memory as well.  You can see I've got some dimensions down there for areas for a rug for our mud/laundry room.  Finally I also put what I want to do next in my dog training (Laika and Merlin are my dogs)

#When I feel overwhelmed or nervous

So having a to-do list is awesome, but sometimes I get really nervous about a certain task.  For example, most recently I'm revamping my resume.  While in therapy we're working through not bottling up the worry, but instead experiencing it and being ok with being worried, in the more "practical" ways, here's how I deal with a task that I'm worried about.

1. **Realize a task is making me nervous.** I generally notice this by a task that I have migrated at least one or two days (check out the video up top for understanding what migrating is), even if I had the time to do it.
2. **Take that task and break it down into tiny, tiny pieces**.  [Here's an example of me working on that for my resume.](https://i.imgur.com/KXL5vY2.jpg)  It's not everything I need to finish my resume, but it's small tiny steps that will at least get me started
3. **[Cover all but one or two tasks with a sticky note.](https://i.imgur.com/8HJEXst.jpg)**  I get anxious when I look at a huge to-do list.  Sometimes I'll do this on daily lists as well, but for some really silly reason, I am far less likely to get overwhelmed if one task and a blank sticky are looking at me instead of a huge list.

So, sorry for the novel.  Hopefully this can help someone who has thought about bullet journals but wasn't sure how to implement it.  This is by no means the only way of doing so, I'm just showing my way of doing it.  

So far, with this new method, I have kept at it for almost 4 weeks, which is HUGE.  This is the longest I have managed any sort of planner outside of when I was in school. I need to get back into it.  My method of bullet journalling is 'spend too much on a nice notebook', 'use for 3 days', 'forget for 3 months', 'add to pile of nice, mostly empty, notebooks', 'wait 3 more months','repeat'.  I use a bullet journal because I like that if I'm really off one week I can just use a page as a brain dump. The flexibility keeps me using it since I can put in as little or as much effort as I want each passing week, depending on how I feel. 

Also, D&D Knit... Fellow ADHD knitter??? I'm so glad you found something that helps. I've only very recently realized, at age 44, that my lifelong problems with procrastination and "lack of self-discipline" are likely due to ADHD. 

But it was a full year ago that I discovered bullet journaling (combined with one other habit I'll mention below) and I have to say, it has actually changed my life. 

**Its strengths**

* It's not on the computer so it doesn't come with tons of adjacent distractions. You know that experience when you pick up your phone to check your to do list and you see an alert that your friend is throwing a birthday party which reminds you that you wanted to get your brother that book for his birthday which is going to be right around thanksgiving this year and remember your friend who made that great turkey that year said to brine it so let's google turkey brines and there's a recipe but oh there's another recipe for pupusas that looks good and it talks about their history among the indiginous people in Central America where the Mayans lived and it would be great to see Chichen Itza 
I wonder how much airfare is and let's shop for vacations for the next two hours? Yea, none of that.

* It's completely flexible to your brain. Organizational tools that work for other people often don't work for me. The entire reason I'm a computer programmer today is because I spent years tinkering and experimenting to create my own tools. Going back to paper let's me have grids, checklists, indexes, lists of lists, and lets me easily see what works and what doesn't. I can change it at a whim, and the parts I didn't follow through with just become things to drop, not things that derail the entire tool/system.

I started out with it being NOTHING but a habit tracker. Something I've tried literally a thousand times with other apps, websites, planners, etc. But just a nice notebook and a nice pen and a simple grid (I like the ones printed in graph format so I can make neat blocks of text instead of long lines) that made me want to pick it up.

The other habit I combined sounds so dumb but it worked for me a lot: having a glass of water first thing in the morning when waking up. It's such a small thing, but it gave me a tiny foothold into the crazy foreign land of "routine" and it helped me start also picking up the journal in the morning.

One especially ADHD-friendly use I've found for it is keeping a list I call "What Works." One problem with being so forgetful is even when I've found little tricks and tactics that work for me *I forget them*. Flipping through and reviewing those from time to time reminds me of strategies I'd otherwise forget. 


 This is great. I've heard about bullet journals but never looked into them. I didn't realize that my personal "To-Do" list system is basically a bullet journal with minor differences. I carry it everywhere. It's the difference between a productive day and wandering around not even remembering what I'm supposed to be doing anyway. Covering most of a list is such a good idea, I literally gasped out loud at the sight. SO CLEVER! I also felt a little choked up because it was one of those little things that make me realize there are other people with brains that work like mine out there. :) I'm going to attempt this next week. My issue right now is that I probably won't keep on top of it at ALL or I'll lose it. I'm supposed to be keeping a log book for my dissertation and I haven't updated it in a couple of weeks. The entries in it were all bullshitted in one session anyway. I got a bullet journal recently....i can't seem to remember to keep up with it, and i can't even remember to keep up with some apps i use to keep track of anything. I'm kind of at a loss of what to do honestly. Do you prefer bujo over apps on your phone? So glad for you! I recently started my bujo and I haven’t been super consistent but the days I do use it I’m literally 300% more productive. I think I might try your idea of using an alarm to remind me to open it up and start when I get to the office. My goal is to use it every work day for the month of November!  I have a few of those. They're not even half filled lol... whoops. Great post! Thanks <3 this.  I'm in a very similar situation and headspace.  I've just started my FIRST journal though, a 8.5" x 5.5".  That's portable enough for me since I almost always have my backpack.  This is fantastic though and may very well be my next iteration.  Or maybe I'll try it out when traveling.... Never take anything you don't want to risk losing (primary journal) to a Burn. I love my bullet journal! It's like a list of all my lists kept all together. I like having everything written down because I think its quicker and easier to make a note on paper, particularly when you are on the phone.   


I pretty much use a combination of the bullet journal and my phone's calendar and reminder system. I've been considering starting a bullet journal. I don't know if I can keep it as part of my EDC, because I can barely keep an EDC together. I tried and failed after about a week.... But maybe I can adjust again.

What journal are you buying? I would love something about the size you describe and the grid is awesome. I have a bullet journal that I’ve been meaning to use for a long time. I couldn’t figure out how to set it up and I got overwhelmed at the thought of it. Thanks for this. I’m gonna try tomorrow  I just started one to keep track of work stuff. I'm curious if anyone has advice/experience on using a single journal for both Work and Home.  I love the idea of bullet journal. Another strategy that I teach in my workshops is using a week-at-a-glance calendar. But not in the traditional way. 

List all your task items and to-do's. Then write each task at a specific a specific date and time in your calendar. Having a written calendar showing all of your tasks in one place helps you to prioritize and focus on the job at hand.

Other tasks, meetings, social or networking events, classes, and appointments should also be placed on your calendar. 
Often, handwriting rather than typing functions better and improves planning and remembering. This has been supported by the latest research.  I did exactly that from 1976 to 1995 without knowing that it was called "bullet journaling" or ADHD. This was me until I got a cover for my little notebook and started to carry it daily. Now I've got a few notebooks that are *entirely* full (*holy shit*, I have never managed to entirely fill a book before I was diagnosed), although I still have a truckload of notebooks to work through. Possibly!  I was Lark, if that means anything to you! I’m a fellow ADHD knitter! Recently diagnosed, and learning just how much knitting and crochet has been a coping mechanism for me the last few years. Yeah!  When I first started a basic thing like this in college, the term "bullet journal" wasn't around yet!  I just hated normal planners, so i got a basic notebook instead.

It's just one of those terms that suddenly got popularized, and in some ways makes it rather helpful to look up ideas if you've got an issue you're trying to solve! That's where committing to every morning is a huge thing!  I had to put an alarm on my phone so I'd actually do it. I do personally, because the phone is always a temptation to get sucked into distraction.

Like, I can distract myself with my bullet journal (doodling, etc.) but it's far more difficult!  So if I use physical paper and pen, it works better.

Additionally, things that I write down stay with me more than things I type, so that helps too.

That being said, an important step of this was to use my phone to make a recurring alarm so that I would plan my day every day, and to check it midday. Yeah, when in school I did a "proto bullet journal" as "bullet journals" weren't really a thing.  That was was the 8.5x5.5 or similar and it worked because I literally always had my backpack with me!

When I no longer carried around a backpack, and HATED lugging larger purses, I realized I needed a smaller notebook. I rely a lot on my phone calendar.  I do have a monthly calendar in my bullet journal, but honestly basically everything that has a specific time to it (appointments, meeting up with people, etc.) works better for me in my phone.  So I just use my phone when I write down the events for the week/day during my planning time so then I've got everything in one space. The one I'm using is [this one.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X3TFKKS/)  It's a 3 pack, $9.  So each notebook is about $3.  It's a little bit pricey for how many notebooks I go through, so I'm considering trying some others, but honestly, I'll probably just buy that again because it's not too bad, and I know what the journal is like.  (The covers are nice and sturdy!) Just start SUPER basic!  The biggest thing that stops me from staying with things it taking on too much.

For now, just write down what you want to do today, and any notes that you want to jot down to remember.  Then, when you feel like that's working, go ahead and start adding/changing things to make it really work for you!  Just go slow, and don't try to totally revamp everything immediately!  (As I think we're all so wont to do...) Oh no, I'm talking about actual knitting -- what is D&D Knit? I love it!! I think it's helped my self confidence too because I can look at a knitted item I finished and know that I CAN finish things and follow through, even if it takes me years and I put the thing down for months at a time. It's like knitting something offers me a tangible way to see how even a little (a row here or there) can produce significant results over time.  Yeah I ended up buying field notes 3 pack for 10 bucks last night. And a cover cause I - hate crumpled paper.

Thanks though! They arrive monday. Along with my first psychiatrist apt. I hope this helps.  That’s basically what I have been doing! A bit sporadically but at least I’m using it a little lol.  Oh, it was a D&D group made up of all knitters. I'm pretty sure it's like a short Paladin.

 > And a cover cause I - hate crumpled paper.

Yes!!  Do the stuff that makes you enjoy it more.  I'm weird in that I actually really like a bit of crumple to kraft paper type stuff, but that makes me happy.

For others, stickers and stuff can make them happy and hey... when you've got issues with dopamine, bring on all the happy you can possibly get! Awesome!  What *really* made it click for me was scheduling times (and setting alarms for those times) to actually use it. Oh I love that! I've never gotten into D&D but always feel like it's something I'd love! It's a lot of fun!!  I got obsessed with The Adventure Zone and then Critical Role.  My husband had played in college, so he was kind enough to DM for me and some friends, but soon realized that DMing wasn't what he really liked to do.

So I then switched to being the DM, then started another game that I'm DMing, and for a brief time played in that knitters game!
