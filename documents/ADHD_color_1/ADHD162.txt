How do people actually stick to using organizers I'm 41 and recently diagnosed inattentive.  Not on any meds currently, but I've been trying to find ways to improve my behavioral habits and make life easier for myself however I can.  One thing that I keep reading about is to use calendars, to do lists, planners, organizer apps, etc.  I do put stuff in my calendar and have the odd sticky note or white board list, but anything more elaborate than that just doesn't stick for me.  Every time I have every tried using these apps or notebook things I've given up very fast.  I will start with the best intentions, but not follow through.  If they require anything more than minimal effort it doesn't happen, and most of them are pretty complex.  They want you to categorize by project, create task lists, assign due dates, priorities, color codes, etc.  It's too much for me!  I have long since given up trying.  It's clearly not for me, but I would love something to work for me because things always seem to slip through the cracks.  and I have no idea others manage these things unless there's something I'm missing.  Does anyone use something dead simple that they can recommend?   There's no one answer for everyone, but you'll have to try a few. The things that are true though...

1. Use only ONE tool or piece of software. One. 
2. It has to fire off reminders automatically.
3. Keep it on your person 100&#37; of the time. No exceptions.

The idea is that you will come in and out of focus, and will remember something at an odd time. When you do, at THAT MOMENT, make a reminder, and set an alarm. 

Hell - set an alarm to look at it a few times a day at first. And do it when you can clear at least one thing off the list each time you look at it. And put in alarms for all the birthdays of every family member, with alerts for 1 week out, the day before, and that morning, so you can a) buy a gift, b) order flowers, and/or c) call that morning to say happy birthday.

After a while, it'll become so goddamn gratifying to get stuff done on time, it'll become ingrained, and you won't lose stuff so often. I use the calendar app for my phone. I have it synced with literally every other app I have on my phone so if a friend texts me to go have dinner at 5 tomorrow it's literally one click and its in my calendar. I just have to remember to click it. It's the default calendar app so it's not fancy by any means but having an event for everything all in one place helps a whole lot. I can see everything I have to do. It's the same for me at work I use my calendar on outlook for everything I need to do at work. It's not 100% fool proof and nothing is but it certainly helps when I have a lot going on. I was never one for planners or physical calendars because it's one more thing I can loose using the default app saves my life. Especially when making plans to do things. If I forget I disappoint my friend or family member because I wasn't where I said I'd be and the shame of that keeps me accountable. To use a planner successfully I had to do two things:
1) structure my day around it. When I get home, the first thing I do is open my planner,  and make a check list based on the things I wrote during the day. I’m still in school so this means it’s the first thing I take out in each lecture. Before making the list, I also double check Canvas.

2) I have the simplest kind possible. It was hard to find, actually. Just a two page spread for each week, with the weekdays each getting an equal amount of space. No bells and whistles.  I also use the Google calendar app, synced to Outlook for professional stuff. I periodically get inspired/suckered into trying a couples planner app, but it’s never really worked for me. I can’t even bear to learn what a bullet journal is. 

One thing that really makes the app work for me over a paper calendar is my Fitbit. I have it set to vibrate for reminders (as well as alarms and incoming texts and calls) and I respond to that so much better than anything else I’ve tried.  I think you just have to find the system that works for you. I certainly have a long trail of failed planners and apps behind me. Right now I'm just using Google Calendar. It's already hooked into my Gmail, so anything I get an email confirmation for gets added automatically. You can set the default reminder preference and all events will have that reminder schedule unless you set a different one. And the reminders come to my Gmail, which I check all the time, so I'm pretty sure to see it. (Not totally sure. I do have ADHD after all.) It's really easy to add new events that don't go in automatically. And then there's just one task list. You can set due dates if you want, but you don't have to. (I believe you can create separate lists, but I just have the one default list.) I find this works for me because it's already hooked into a system that I'm familiar with and that I use a lot. I keep the tab open on my computer and have the app on my phone, so I always have access to it. 

The other thing I do is carry a small notebook with me at all times. I'm talking pocket sized. This is just my brain dump. So whenever my brain decides to actually remember something, I can immediately write it down. There's absolutely no hierarchy in this thing. It's anything from "remember to pay the power bill" to "research venus flytraps because they're cool." This is also supposed to be a backstop to keep me from chasing every random thought that pops into my head instead of doing whatever I'm supposed to be doing. I try to write it down for later and then get back on task. It works ... uh ... sometimes.  I personally have found that i’m terrible at keeping planners! No matter how cute of one I buy. What i’ve found that works amazingly for me is buying a big deal calendar and hanging it on my wall above my desk and filling it out at the beginning of every month (and of course add things as things pop up). It works way better for me because it’s always in my field of vision at my desk constantly reminding me to look at it and to utilize it.  Android google calender really helped me out with notifications because I always have my phone on me.  I bullet journal. Not like the elaborate and time consuming ones, though- mine is just a monthly list and a little weekly calendar to keep up with appointments. I do specific days when I need to, and make sure and index pages that have other lists on them. I never make pages in advance, so it’s just writing things down in a semi-structured way so I can find them later. It lives with a pen in my bag all the time so that I have it whenever I need it. If I go a week without writing anything down, I don’t sweat it. Also long as you get a system that’s simple enough to use regularly, you’ll be okay. Get an ADHD coach, you won't regret it. At our age, breaking and making habits can be difficult.

I was diagnosed at 42 (I'm 44 now). I'm Combined, mainly Inattentive with mental hyperactivity.

The journey has been hard but amazing though one word of advice - how is your wife? She's been living with someone who hasn't been able to connect properly with her and might be unhappy. Talk to her and show her what she really means to you

 I got the Planner Pad before I got diagnosed but partly because I read bout it being effective for people with ADHD. I haven't stuck to it perfectly but I like it a lot. What I do is make sure it's out and open-to-the-right-page on the kitchen table (where I have my coffee in the morning) before I go to bed. That makes me interact with it at least twice. The night before is a good time for me starting to get anxious about forgetting things, and looking at it in the morning reminds me of what I want to get done. 

I also use google calendar for anything I need/want to show up at. I've tried doing the physical calendar thing multiple times. It's seems flashy and perfect at the time of setup, but once it looses its dazzle, I lose interest and forget about keeping up with it. Whenever I actually get back to it, I forget what I was doing with it and get overwhelmed to start all over again. That's when I toss it aside and forget it.

So far, I've had the best luck with both Google Calendar (remind me of important dates, bills, appointments, etc.) and Wunderlist (remind me of more routine daily tasks like take meds, do a cardio workout, 10 minute meditation, complete a 30 minute work session, etc.).

Yeah, even when going digital, I tend to lose focus and fall off track for a few days; but since I set recurring daily alerts, it keeps popping up every day as an extra reminder to help me get back on track. I've disciplined myself to never dismiss a task unless I actually completed it. Don't try to do it all at once. Slowly start putting another strategy in before you move in to the next one. Small simple changes are easier. 

You use a calendar? Great! Now try adding a to do list or a chore chart, but not both. Don't overwhelm yourself. There's always next week.  Wise words from the patron saint of getting shit done:

your aim when starting anything difficult is to aim low enough that the changes you make can stick, because you've already learned that you're incapable of taking on tasks of the size you thought you could handle.

For example, you could find a notes app, and throw all your thoughts into there, like paper into a fireplace. Then when you eventually feel that that is too easy, or you're really itching for more, introduce little bits of structure over time (prioritising the structure that you find important, not whatever your system asks of you.) little by little you step closer to being a sorted individual Bullet journaling and my girlfriend keeps me mostly organized. my bullet journal has got things I like in it and it has been seriously life changing for me I'm quite bad at keeping up with planners but I have a filofax (ring binder planner) with pages I make and print myself. Less time consuming than drawing out the pages every week for a bullet journal, and easier to look at a glance. Plus you can customise pages for whatever you want. I'm planning a food diary (doing Slimming World), weight loss diary, checklist for sign offs I need, and contact details for consultants and other staff I've met/need to meet. I'll be wedding planning soon so I'm sure I'll have a section for that. 

I keep up with it because I also use it for note taking day-to-day. Meetings, clinics, bedside teaching, etc (I'm a med student). I put my to do list on the bottom of my week to 2 page spread, and sit with it when I get home to take my unorganised scrappy notes and to dos into something obvious and more organised. Ring binder means I just take out the scrappy note pages when I'm done, no messy ripping.  **TL;DR**

1. stick with whatever you choose and make it your bestest friend in the world

2. figure out what works best for you and try new things if you want, but keep using what works best for you 

3. if you use more than just ***one*** thing, you don't always have to use ***all** of the things, just make sure you're still getting your shit done 



lmao I word dumped and stuck my tl;dr at the top but read the rest if you want

I've been using Google Calendar since 2015 (bless the thing for even existing) because that's when I \~really\~ started to need it, and I've stuck with it ever since. 

Like a lot of people have said, ***you have to stick with it***. Really, really try your bestest to make yourself and whatever you choose to use attached to the hip at all times, and try to stick to ***one app and one physical thing at the very most***. 

I say 2 because I'm a student and that's what works best for me, but you should figure out what works best for you! That could be 2 apps (a calendar and to do) and a physical. Or just a physical. Or whatever really. It's really kind of up to you.  
(But, if you go too fancy you'll regret it and your entire life so much and it'll be such a pain to maintain it that you just won't, so please don't do that.)

Trying new things out is great and it can help a lot and fill in any gaps in your system you might have! But if you choose to try too many new sparkly things and forget the bestest most sparkly thing, that's gonna suck. 

Also the bestest sparkly thing helps a lot if you can set reminders for 1 week, 1 day, 2 hours, 1 hour, and 15 minutes beforehand. Maybe that's just a me thing though. 

I'd also like to chime in and say that I've tried the bullet journal. It's wonderful, amazing, the love of my life even! 

***But it's summer and I literally have like 5 things to do a month and I have literally melted and disintegrated into a nocturnal pile of nothingness that can not begin comprehend waking up earlier than 5 PM much less keeping up with a physical journal that I must dedicate even the slightest bit of time to maintain.*** 

So I'll be quitting it until the school year decides to roll over and kill me and will gladly dedicate half my soul to maintaining it again because it's great for school and keeps me on track and that's what's *important*. 

*Keeping myself on track*. 

Having 2 systems (or more) doesn't necessarily mean you have to use both of them at the same time, especially if it doesn't suit your current situation. You can drop one of them sometimes as long as you still have *something* making sure you don't miss your doctors appointments and whatever else is important in your life at the moment. 

It literally doesn't matter if you have the most amazing, fancy, wonderful app or planner, or whatever if it doesn't work for you. So, figure out what works for you and dump your soul into it (or if you're like me, just split your soul between your 2 systems or however many work for you).  Thank you.  It's all both new and not new at the same time.  One thing I've realized is how I've already developed a lot of good habits...  coping strategies to avoid issues (like I always put my wallet, keys, etc in the same exact place so I don't lose them, etc).  But like you said, there are other habits that will be hard to break.  It's mainly paying attention to everything I do more in light of ADHD and noticing for once what works and what doesn't. 

That includes things that have been hard for my wife that I haven't always recognized or appreciated, but now do.  Like, tuning her out in conversations or forgetting what we talked about earlier.  She understands it better now, and that it's not that I don't care or think what she says isn't important, but still she's someone who needs actions over words so that's what I'm trying hard to improve.
