PSA for Package Delivery Couriers for Wheelchair Users  I'm not sure they are aware of the wheelchair situation, I'm sure they would leave them elsewhere if instructed to do so Delivery companies keep leaving things with neighbours whose doorbells I can't get to because they have porches with steps..  I like your videos but, FYI, the audio level is way too low on all of them.  The following video might be helpful for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nITukcOL44M


 Most do.. some still don't. 

She made this just as kind of a general PSA of where would be the best place to put it. In the case that a UPS person knows the recipient is in a wheelchair, they might not think that up against the wall on the side that the door opens is the best. They might instead think to put it in the middle of the porch to give room, but for us, that's more inconvenient.
 Thanks for the tip.. we'll have to try that out for the next video I'm not wheelchair bound so I don't know the struggles of that however I only have use of one hand so picking up anything heavy or oddly shaped from below waist height is a huge pain for me. I occasionally have to ask for help while shopping because of this so I don't drop or break things.  Obviously not, or you'd know that "wheelchair bound" is not the phrase of choice...  What is the acceptable term you want people to use. I know the term I use for myself isn't a social approved one but I'm not politically correct  "wheelchair user" is perfectly fine! So I can't refer to a wheelchair user as wheels and ask for a ride?  Only if you wanna get your feet run over :)
