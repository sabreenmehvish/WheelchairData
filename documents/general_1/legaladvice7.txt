My apartment has no wheelchair accessibility during renovations I live in Oakville, Ontario and my apartment is having some renovations done to the sidewalk out front of the buildings. One building is completely blocked off by wet cement and the other doesn't have a curb cut for people with wheelchairs. The only other doors are accessible by stairs.

I don't have a wheelchair and this has actually been like this for a few days but I didn't realize it was a problem until I saw a woman in a wheelchair struggle to get down an 8 inch curb from my window. My apartment office is closed, the AODA report line is closed, and Service Oakville is closed.

I'm especially worried if there's a fire and people won't be able to get out. What should I do? I'm not 100% sure if they would be able to help but I'm pretty sure the fire marshal would be all over something like this. Give them a call and see if it's something they'd want to check out.  Ask them to put one in because you're a concerned citizen.  Hi from Toronto.

NAL but have been in similar situations with family members. 

How long will these renovations be going on for? You mentioned that the renovations are happening on the sidewalk itself. Does this mean the sidewalk leading to the apartment or the municipality owned sidewalk along the road? If it's the former, then it's the landlord's problem and he needs to provide wheelchair access. If it's the latter, then first see if the crews working can set up something. Even a makeshift ramp will do.

If this problem is persistent over the next few weeks, definitely get in touch with the AODA and the fire marshal. Subreddit rules say I cannot recommend going to the media.
