1000 Thank you's for your help! I came here recently about sending birthday cards for a veteran I know.  He is the husband of a friend of mine and he is over the moon, happy about being made to feel special on his 50th birthday. The person from Alaska who sent the airborne coin really touched him. He got so overwhelmed with emotion that he triggered but he loved it. I'm giving it a week or so to let any stragglers arrive and I'll post a picture for y'all. Again, thank y'all for the help! 

Here's some pictures of what he's gotten so far... http://imgur.com/a/InI4dLE

I mentioned his struggles and even I didn't know what all he had been through, just with his health. This is a copy paste from a message his wife sent me. 

"4 hip repair surgeries, both hips replaced, busted back, needs C3 replaced with artificial bone and plate put in. Will be in wheelchair in the next 5-8 years permanently. But he refuses to give up."
