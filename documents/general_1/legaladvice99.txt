My Apartment complex has installed a new disabled parking spot My Apartment complex has installed a new disabled parking spot without making changes to the current spot I just woke up one day with a handicap sign in front of my car. I thought they were required to have an access ramp for wheel chair accessibility and a buffer area for loading and unloading? just to be clear i have asked asked management and they told me there were other kinds of disabled people not just ones in wheelchairs :/   [(picture)](https://i.imgur.com/FytsWZu.jpg) Tampa FL It's possible they haven't done that part yet. Nobody here knows what they are planning to do. You should ask them.  ---

LocationBot 4.2836 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) Regardless of whether the spot is compliant or not, that doesn't mean you can use the space without a placard. that is not the point of my post and I am no longer parking there  Nothing else concerns you personally, from a legal point of view.  And the questions we answer here are legal issues that directly concern the person asking the question.

You don't know if that's a temporary measure, or what.  You can go and ask.
