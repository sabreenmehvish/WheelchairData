The all new Nissan Leaf, zero emissions and very practical if you are disabled! Has anyone else driven one? We absolutely loved it!  Is this thing able to carry my power chair? If I can find something cheaper than a minivan that can haul it around that would be great. Absolutely, firstly the seat height is perfect for transferring, it is very comfortable and it has heated leather seats which I personally think leather seats make a transfer even easier, it has a gadget called e-pedal which enables you to drive with just the one pedal which makes it easier if you suffer from joint pain, it has very light steering, all in all if you are able to transfer into cars then this car would be great as we also are wheelchair users and managed better in this car than your standard car however we totally understand everyone’s needs are different all we do is just give people an idea on how suitable cars actually are.  I’m considering one of these but I don’t have a garage. Is that a dealbreaker? How do you charge it? What features exactly make it great for “disabled” users? Can you explain what you mean? Might be a fun car, but it looks impractical for drivers who are wheelchair users... If you are able to transfer I do believe it would be suitable for you to ride in as the transfer height is amazing however I am not too sure on it carrying a powered chair and to get a wheelchair in the boot it would need to be folded unfortunately but it really is an amazing car 😁 Well that is where you may be wrong as this car has something call an e-pedal which means you can actually drive this car with just one foot without having to swap between the accelerator and brake pedal so it may actually be worth a look 😁😁😁 That’s absolutely fine, all models plug into your mains sockets at home and all models come with the appropriate adapter cables  How does the Leaf compare to other similar cars for people in wheelchairs or with other disabilities?

I am all for electric cars, but this is the disability forum. Does the Leaf offer advantage or offer features not found in other cars of similar size? Well, let's see. I am disabled and on SSDI and no insurance and not working and missing my right foot sooo...I'm gonna have to pass. We take a carer with us when we go out in the car so our carer would put the wheelchair in the boot for us 😁 Yes the e-pedal does work with hand controls 😁 That is a fair comment and totally understandable 😊😊😊 Practical? I guess if your disability is mental, or a slight physical issue like you carry oxygen. 

Of course then you have to pay for the thing. Not for me.  I doubt it, it's not terribly large- it's probably the size of a Honda Civic possibly smaller. Even if you could put a lift on it for the chair, added weight reduces the range of electric vehicles, meaning at the least it would need to be charged more frequently.  Seems impractical. Heated seats make me have to poop. You don’t actually require a garage as you can just plug it directly into a normal socket at home as long as you have off road parking :) hope that helps :)  Okay I can transfer but I'm not sure how I would put a power chair in the back of this car after I've all ready transferred. Aren’t you on Medicare with SSDI? I can't afford a carer or whatever, I'm more or less on my own so this isn't really good for independent use. Ah, okay so in my case at least, not very practical for my disability. Thank you. Like you run an extension cord out of your house to your driveway? That could potentially work! I’d be going for an older model though because I can’t afford to buy a new car. It depends on your power chair but the lighter, foldable ones can do great with a roof lift or a boot/back seat hoist. If you have a solid electric chair you're going to need a drive in van which I'm sure you're aware of anyway.  nope. gotta wait 24 months. Just qualified in May for SSDI Have you considered transferring them lifting your chair across you into the car? This is how myself and other friends manage it independently.  It is practical only for the author of this post. With the same success you can say OMG_I_love_my_Tesla_because_its_mine.
Reasons? Tesla has doors opening vertical, that's mean that you can transfer from your wheelchair more easily.
It is more spacious. It may come adapted directly from the manufacturer. And you can pull your chair in more easily.
Get Tesla, it's so great!!!
It was sarcasm... Yeah it's a solid chair, but I see now OP deleted their comment stating that it was practical for people with disabilities. After multiple people with disabilities come out and ask very basic questions. What was your date of disability? I’ve heard that they backdate it to that but then others have said it is from the date of determination  My chair is a 200 lbs power chair I'm relatively certain it wouldn't slide across me well.  I mean it would be suitable for me, because I transfer from my chair to the seat then dismantle my chair to lift over me into the car. All independent manual users I know in person do this as well. They mentioned the need to transfer in a post reply and later that your chair will need to be able to fold as an electric. As an electric chair user in a solid chair though I'm sure you're aware that you will need a van.

I'm not seeing where they ignored the basic questions? They're a bit of a jumble, I assume OP is posting from mobile as they're not direct replies to posts, that happens to me sometimes and I don't even know it's happened until I get to a computer. I've matched them up to help with readability.

Other comments are about not being about to afford a car or it not being suitable (or heated seats making you need to poop. Thanks /u/toastbuddyc, you gave me a giggle. Very true though!) . Those things are fine, not everyone can afford a car and everyone's disability is different. But this is suitable for some chair users and I believe they answered questions pretty fairly, albeit in a jumble. 

I particularly love the post that decided my C4 quad friend has 'a slight physical issue' because he drives a car similar to this. I'll make sure and tell him. Gatekeeping of disability severity in a disability subreddit...not impressed. 

I wonder if OP has missed a link as their previous post was a video review (different car) with more details in it. Nov 24, 2017. They start with determination date, recently checked The comment OP deleted stated it was practical for people with disabilities.  And upon asking about a piece of equipment literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of people use and others stating that it isn't covered by insurance nor affordable for people who have to live on SSDI or similar it was determined that this isn't always the case. I'm glad you have the spare time to go through and comb people's replies but I noticed you didn't bother quoting the one where I very clearly stated, this isn't practical for me. So I don't understand why you feel the need to reiterate this when I have all ready clearly iterated it. 

This isn't me looking for a discussion either. I've said my piece on this. And there's really not too much else here to talk about.  I didn't quote your post about it not being practical for you because it didn't require a reply from OP. If it's not practical for you, it's not practical for you. It's not a question, there's no response OP can give to that that's helpful. My apologies for misunderstanding you, I thought your issue was that people weren't getting a response to their questions. I took time out of what I was doing to reply to you because I genuinely thought it would help you and others reading this post. 

It is practical for *some* people with disabilities and for that reason I believe it belongs here. We don't all have the same disabilities and no equipment will always be suitable. There are a lot of disability devices and services out there that aren't covered by insurance, I don't believe that we should just ignore them because some people can't afford them. Not everyone lives on SSDI, or is even in America. Some people with disabilities can work or have other income, they should still be able to get support with things they can afford.

I am on the bottom rung and can't afford many things that would help my disability, but I'm happy to see them posted for others it may help. It stings a little to know my life could be much better with more money, but that's the way it is. Choosing a car is difficult for everyone and it's even harder with a disability, some people like a place to start. If I was to go round this sub commenting on everything that wasn't suitable for me there would be very few posts left.  

 Let me break it down for you. 

They said its practical for people with disabilities. I asked regarding whether or not it fit a power chair, they basically replied with I don't know/no. And then I stated, okay, then it is not practical for me. That was the extent of the whole interaction. 

You're replying to me stating it is practical for some, that's great but that has nothing to do with me or my question regarding holding a 200 lbs chair. I'm actually pretty confident in saying it would not be practical for anyone with a large chair. But again, nothing to do with me or my chair. So I guess my question to you now is this.

What does this car being practical for some people have to do with me asking about my chair that will clearly not fit?

 I don't care if OP responds to others or not. I do care when a broad statement like "This car is practical for people with disabilities" is uttered when that is shown to not he true for ALL people with disabilities. I know OP didn't use the word all, but that level of detail is necessary when you're referring to a rather large group of individuals residing on this planet.
