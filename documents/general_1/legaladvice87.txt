Jail Refuses to provide wheelchair in cell to inmate with cerebral palsy. Hi guys and thanks in advance. Just seeking some advice on how to get a local jail to allow my mother to have a wheelchair. She has cerebral palsy hemiplegia but the staff refuse to provide her with a wheel chair in the cell. I submitted a prescription from her doctor to the jail and I have a document from the judge stating she is to receive a wheelchair from the items that the police seized, but they wont let her have it in the cell. I have voice recording of the medical staff member saying she wont be allowed to have it in the cell. Is there anything I can do?  So it is only in the cell that she is not allowed to have it? Outside she has access to it? [If you believe your rights have been violated and would like to receive help from the ACLU of Kentucky, you may submit your request by downloading and filling out our complaint form here](http://www.aclu-ky.org/article/legal/) Location is Kentucky.  Yes, they said she could use it for transport to visitation, but that she can't have it in the cell.  Thank you.  I am guessing it is a safety issue as they cannot have things in the cell that she could self harm with. 

You can google jail rights groups and see what they say.  Its worth a shot but I am not sure she is considered a 'civilian'.
Your best bet wold be to show it is medically necessary, if the doctors are on board, I think the ACLU would have ground to stand on with the prison board/warden. Likewise, the chair could be disassembled and used as a weapon.
