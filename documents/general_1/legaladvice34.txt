[Ontario] Rented apartment when I had 2 legs, now I have 1. Won't let me end tenancy and apartment is not wheelchair friendly. [Ontario, Canada]

I'm actually writing this for my father. My father signed a lease for an apartment about 1 month before the scheduled move-in date (October 1st). A few days later, he had his leg amputated in an unfortunate turn of events and is now in a wheelchair for an undetermined amount of time and a prosthetic leg is not an option for a few months at least. 

On October 2nd, my father got a day pass from the hospital and we took him to the apartment. In short, the apartment is not wheelchair friendly and there are many mobility and safety issues that would prevent him from living here comfortably. 

- can not enter/exit the apartment by himself. The pushback from the automatically closing door is too strong for him to simultaneously push himself into the apartment. There is a "ledge" that he has to pop a wheelie over and there is a wall right when you enter that makes turning into the apartment almost impossible. We are concerned if there is an emergency that he will be unable to leave on his own. 

- he can not wheel into the bathroom or close to the bathroom due to the apartment layout. 

- the living room space is very small and the carpet makes mobility in the wheelchair very difficult 

He wrote the landlord/superintendent a letter outlining the concerns and gave notice that he would have to move out on November 30 (At the moment he's still in the hospital). They wrote a letter back saying they are not accepting his end of tenancy request. 

Can they deny this request based on his new disability? I know it's not their fault this happened but he can't live there. 

What now? He did find a wheelchair accessible apartment to move into when he is released from the hospital so that problem is solved, however, I don't want to see him being sued etc. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

TLDR: my dad lost a leg before moving into an apartment he rented before the amputation. Apartment isn't wheelchair friendly and mobility and safety are a concern. Gave notice and Landlord refused end of tenancy letter. What now? Under human rights legislation, housing providers have a duty to accommodate tenants to the point of undue hardship - see [what the OHRC has to say on the issue] (http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/discrimination-based-disability-and-duty-accommodate-information-housing-providers).

The landlord does not have to accept the accommodation exactly as you request it, but they do have to come up with something that would be mutually acceptable - for example making sure your father has an apartment where he can get around easily.

Some things, like changing the layout of an apartment that was designed before housing codes were modernized may not be feasible. But other things they may have to change, such as the door that can't be opened by those with physical limitations. 

The Ontario Human Rights Commission has a helpline that you can contact tomorrow - they are very helpful. If you don't get anywhere with u/dtgal's excellent advice to talk to OHRC, Ontario codifies in law your father's right to sublet or assign his lease. It'd be his responsibility to find a replacement tenant and to ask the landlord, in writing, for permission, but if the landlord blanketly refuses to allow assignment, or if his landlords ignore his request, he can terminate his tenancy with 30 days' notice, even mid-lease. If his landlord refuses a specific replacement tenant without good cause, your father can also ask the Landlord and Tenant Board to end his tenancy or order the landlord to allow the assignment.

The specific rules to follow are laid out in [section 95 of the Residential Tenancies Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17#BK150). If he gives notice as a result, it must be [on form N9](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/documents/ltb/Notices%20of%20Termination%20&%20Instructions/N9.pdf). If his landlord refuses a specific assignee without good cause, he can file [form A2](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/documents/ltb/Landlord%20Applications%20&%20Instructions/A2.pdf) with the Board to seek an order. [removed] Isn't the easiest thing for OP to just find a subletter? I hope that the law will be kind to OP's dad, but I can see it also protecting the landlord to some degree. Instead of dragging things out, it might be the quickest to just sublet (even if that were prohibited in the lease, I hope that the landlord would have heart enough to allow that at least) and move on. A lot of people can use one leg along with a walker and a wheelchair only in the community for long distances. Is this feasible for him?

Also, if you need extra time, you may be able to have him transferred to a skilled nursing facility while you sort out his living arrangements. I know this thread is older now. I just wanted to add my 2 cents.


The landlord is required to accommodate to the point of undue hardship. I think you should get a doctor's letter stating what modifications would be needed to make the unit accessible and don't hold back.



Then send a letter to the landlord, with a copy of the doctor's letter. 
State that you're requesting the following accommodations under the OHRC and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. List everything you want to make the apartment accessible. Then state "OR release from the lease on November 30th". 



My guess is that they'll let you out of the lease before they spend thousands on retrofits.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/legaladvice) if you have any questions or concerns.* I wonder if you could force them to retrofit the apartment? A threatening lawyer's letter might convince them to end the tenancy otherwise they have some expenses to face.

The threat of them having to retrofit should be enough for them break the lease to your benefit!  And if they retrofit for you, will you be OK? Get a lawyer Your landlord is both an idiot and a lawbreaker.  [removed] This is incredibly valuable. Thank you! I will have him give a call tomorrow and seek their input. Thanks for sharing.  Ha! Yeah, he was always told he shouldn't have feet problems because he is tall &skinny and that it usually happens to those that are overweight. But here we are 10 years later and 1 leg down. I wouldn't be surprised if there are complications with his residual limb later on. They're keeping an eye on it. Thanks :)

Edit: forgot to mention it was from a diabetic ulcer that turned into gas gangrene in a matter of days.  Considering the difficulty OP's dad has getting onto and around the property, I would not sublet it. That leaves dad still ultimately responsible for the property and his subtenant.

If the lease cannot be legally terminated, it should be **assigned** to a new tenant, not sublet. Wash his hands of the property and never have to deal with it again. Thank you! He isn't at the point to use a walker without concern for his safety. The nurses won't allow him to use a walker anymore since he took a fall. He is on pain meds and his clarity isn't all there, same with his strength/stamina. I think a walker would be totally reasonable though, but likely in a few weeks. 

With regard to his housing - he found an apartment suitable for his wheelchair usage right now and will be moving in Dec 1. 

Thank you for your reply!

edit: he will be moving into the accessible apartment and still trying to figure out the situation with the previous apartment until resolved somehow.  Be fair to the Dad.  This is all very, very new.  He has only been this way for a month.

It takes time to learn how to do those things.  To go from wheelchair, to crutches or caine to fake leg seems like a logical progression to me.

What he needs is NOT asking too much.  Consider:  He isn't even asking the landlord to do anything except tear up the lease.

The landlord is acting like an asshole in this.  They are going to find themselves going from simply having to tear up a lease and eat a couple months rent to having to pay to have a bunch of construction done to an apartment. Hey! Thank you for the comment on this. I hired a lawyer to handle the correspondence for me, since I travel a lot for work and didn't really have the time or legal know how to navigate the system. They forwarded a letter basically stating exactly what you said, for the most part. I haven't heard back yet, but hopefully it gets resolved soon. 

Thank you! > I wonder if you could force them to retrofit the apartment? 

No a landlord has no obligation to retrofit an apartment at their expense. The tenant is generally required to cover the cost of retrofitting it and restoring it to original condition when the lease ends. [removed] [removed] *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

*If you feel this was in error, message the [moderators.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLegalAdvice)* They probably won't be open tomorrow. Yeah, that's what happened to my father. He lost the second leg a little over a year later due to the same thing as the first. And then a different ulcer a little over a year later is what finally did him in. Make sure to keep an eye on it, and to bring him in immediately if anything pops up. My father was a stubborn prick, and would constantly believe that he knew what to do to treat it. All kinds of nope there.

Good luck! Is this type 1 or type 2? If it's a BKA, check out flo-tech-it has a stump shaper and an attachment you can add for pre-gait training. It's nice. Yeah, I work with people pre and post prosthetics training.

Depends on the person. No matter what, you won't be in a prosthetic immediately, as the stump has to heal somewhat before you can weight bear through it. Some can manage with one leg and a walker; some can't. If dad could use a walker in the apartment, the immediacy of the issue would be somewhat negated, though it's still a quality of life problem and definitely falls under ADA as long as the apartment building meets ADA criteria (enough units to be subject, etc).

If OP's dad was being discharged tomorrow, there may not be time for ADA updates. But it sounds like they have the living situation worked out.
 
As OP posted in response to my last post, the issue is now only about what to do with the original apartment. Hmm.  It would be unfortunate to have to move because of medical problem, but its really sucky of management to not let OP off the hook. This is wrong. 



In Ontario, the landlord has a legal obligation to accommodate the tenant to the point of undue hardship. That includes retrofits unless a) the required retrofit is impossible, b) they come to a better solution for an accommodation, or c) the landlord can demonstrate that it would be to the point of undue hardship, which is a very high bar. [removed] Too bad.  In certain situations it really is the best course.  The shotgun approach isn't the best advice, but contacting a one media outlet and promising them an exclusive may get some good coverage. Ah right, definitely not. I forgot about the holiday. Thanks! Piggybacking off of this. They will not be open tomorrow OP as it is a holiday.  [deleted] It's type 1 diabetes - controlled with insulin. Thanks, I'll check it out. It's a knee disarticulation (through the knee) so not sure if the same rules apply. Seems like there are less resources for KD than AKA & BKA.  The OP is in Canada so the ADA doesn't really matter... The group of words associated with cat (catt, cath, chat, katze) stem from the Latin catus, meaning domestic cat, as opposed to feles, or wild cat.

LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) While it is definitely not Columbus Day in Canada, apparently it is their Thanksgiving.  Ooh fancy-probably no flo-tech but he could end up with a c-leg which has a microprocessor for a knee.  Do you know if they have an equivalent?

Edit: oof; just checked. Apparently not. Go home, bot, you're drunk. Yep, thanksgiving here for us. Nevertheless we will get in touch with them on Tuesday. Thanks! It's handled by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, and the appropriate rules for accommodating disabilities are set out in a number of separate pieces of human rights legislation at both the federal and the provincial level. Similar end result, but without the convenient three-letter abbreviation. I'm sure there is something but I am not familiar with it It can't go home,  it doesn't know the location.  Read carefully about the accessibility laws. Come up with a LONG list of demands and site each and every single demand with where it is written in the laws. Make sure that you have several thousands of dollars worth of upgrades.

Now gleefully pass this carefully curated list on to the building manager. When they flip out, tell them that you don’t think it is fair that the building management company has to deal with this so counter with a second offer to tear up the lease.

They are cheap pricks and cheap pricks take the cheaper offer every single time.  Ontario has something but that's all I could find... You're a dad, yes? Cause that's a great dad joke. Made me laugh, anyways. It's called the Ontarians With Disabilities Act https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/110191
(The reg is more instructive than the Act itself)
