My family abandoned me after I was disabled but now that my sister's pregnant they want me to be the guardian in case they die. (PA) So, I posted about this on another sub and they suggested I check with the sub about what I can do in this situation. About three years ago when I was in an accident – a severe car accident that resulted in a brain injury, my right leg needing to be amputated at the knee, as well as limb salvage surgery on my left leg (I'm really looking at just amputating this one too since it doesn't work properly). My husband and best friend were the only ones who showed up at the hospital after the accident happened. I understand that we lived 4 hours away at the time but I nearly died, my mom even bitched at my husband for waking her up at 2 am when he was trying tell her that I survived emergency surgery. Even when I was transferred to a long-term rehabilitation facility back near my hometown no one but husband and our friends visited. I couldn’t even get my parents or my sister to occasionally drive me to physical and speech therapy after I was home, I couldn’t drive because of seizures and vision problems. 

So we’re kind of estranged, I’ve seen them like a couple times at most in the last year. But now I’m getting calls, voicemails and emails inviting me to all these baby related events – my mother and grandmother even dropped by to ask if I’d be helping them prepare a baby shower and buy the cake. Then they dropped the bomb on me – since I’m my pregnant sister’s only sibling they’re putting me and husband as the child’s guardian in their will once it’s born. 

Like I’m broke as fuck because medical bills are fucking expensive, I can’t work and my SSDI hasn’t gone through (I was actually denied the first time so I have to hire an attorney now) so it’s just my poor husband working his ass off. I also just don’t want to raise this child if something should happen, for a variety of reasons. What if they put me in their will for the child, how do I deal with that? I mean it's kind of a dick move if they both die in some freak accident, which I know is totally possible, if I don't take the child it would go to my aging parents (who weren't exactly parents of the year) or it would go to foster care. Is there any way to prevent them from putting me in their will – I want nothing from them and definitely am not capable of raising their child.
 Could it be that your family thinks you are getting a large settlement due to the accident? like suddenly you are now an appropriate guardian because of your bank account? They can put whatever they want in their will, that does not obligate you to take on the burden of a child.  That's not how it works. Children aren't property that can be willed away.  They can stipulate that they want you to be considered as a potential guardian for that child -- most children's services automatically look for the closest living relative anyway.  If they do come to you and you are not willing to foster the child, you can simply say so.  If they're actually dumb enough to try and attach some kind of stipulation to it (such as "if you don't agree you get nothing") a decent lawyer will shred that to bits because it isn't legal.

In the future the situation may change and you may be in a more secure position to provide for a minor's needs.  Or it may never even come to that.  You don't need to worry. Frankly, you have no legal or moral obligation to take the child in if your sister and BIL die. They can write it into their will until their fingers shrivel up and fall off, it won't hold up. 

Courts aren't going to look at it and go "well, Jenny wanted her sister Jane to take the baby in if this ever happened, so that baby belongs to Jane now!"

Like another poster said, if the unlikely happens you'll be considered as a guardian option, but if you say no that should be the end of it. I hope the mods let this stay, as it is only tangentially legal advice. It’s more advice on the disability. I suddenly became disabled a few years ago (at 25), and I work with people in similar situations.

First off, it is absolutely normal to be turned down for SSDI and have to hire an attorney. Don’t let that hit you down at all, it happens to like 3/4 of cases. In addition, TBI is very hard to prove. I have a friend with a TBi in the process right now. You need to find a local attorney who has time to meet with you in person. For the love of all that is holy don’t call a national attorney. Between now and then, go to all your doctors appointments and be sure to go in if you’re even worried about something: it’s all ammo in the ALJ hearing.

Second, I was talking about how expensive disability is just this morning. It costs about $3,300/month if you live alone, are in a wheelchair, and need a wheelchair van . I assume you know what your SSDI payment will be and can see the problem there. Those costs never go away, they just go down a bit, so take that into account when planning.

Obviously I don’t know your situation with your leg, but if you can still walk on it at all you need to really, really think about the amputation. Obviously you’ve been told that, but I have a different POV. Of course life in a wheelchair is hard, but you get used to it. It’s really not that different at the end of the day. However, it is *EXTREMELY* expensive. My power wheelchair was $45,000 — there is a deductible for DMG you have to pay, and a co-pay, frequently $5-6k but it all depends on your insurance. If your husband isn’t “handy” and you have any steps up to your front door, you’ll also be paying a small fortune for a wheelchair ramp. And permanent ramps are supposed to be one foot long for every one inch in height. More than 8” up to your front door and you’re gonna die when you hear the estimate. You’ll also eventually need your bathtub replaced, as well as your countertops all throughout the house. You can avoid the countertops but by paying ~$5,000 more (generally out of pocket) for your wheelchair to have a lift function. Even if it’s just the bathroom, house demolition and refinishing in a custom (accessible) way is way more expensive than most people think. You’ll need a new oven, possibly a new dish washer, all that stuff if you can still help out in the house.

The kicker, though, is the wheelchair van. A $26,000 Chrysler, after being fitted to carry a wheelchair, sells for about $60,000. That’s $1,200/month. Buy used you say? It takes them almost 10 years to drop back to their original retail price. Can you imagine paying $20k for a 2008 minivan? That isn’t even the worst part, though: the gear for the ramp is only intended to last for 5 years before it is supposed to be removed entirely, have all the consumables replaced, be cleaned, etc., at a cost of major bank. Most people don’t have this done, because it will last past this date and they’ll sell the van anyway. So that 10 year old van may have its lift crap out next week, and you’ll have to invest another $5k — cash — to get it working again.

So, like I said, if you can still bear weight on that leg, consider those costs. Obviously if it’s better to have it removed, do so, but keep in mind the upcoming costs. Having a leg to use as a pivot to transfer into bed/the tub/the car is a godsend, and will save you a fortune every year.

Are you doing okay emotionally? I have some advice I share with the people I talk to about how to get back on track mentally after becoming disabled, but I don’t want to overstep if you have everything under control. Your post makes it sound like you probably do. 

I hope you keep doing well. I won’t tell you to reach out if you need anything, because that is strictly against the rules here, but I *am* on reddit a lot.  You have no obligation to take responsibility for children that aren't your own.  Even if they stipulate that they want custody to pass to you, you're not required to accept it.  They would then either go to another family member or family friend who wants custody or would go into the system.

An option you may want to consider is, if they want the children to go to family members and you're not outright against it, have them get life insurance policies that pay out to a trust established for the care of the children.  This would give you the financial ability to care for them as well as allow the children to stay together and with family rather than entering the system.  But that's a personal choice you and your husband have to make. You don't have to take the kid, but I would let your family know your intentions in case your sister wants to leave the kid with someone other than your family "No" is a complete sentence, and they cannot compel you to do this. You cannot be legally obligated to be responsible for the child.  They can write anything they want in their will, but nobody can or will force you to take a child that is not yours.

 Tell them to eff off.  Also, if things come to pass, make sure CPS knows how your parents treated you.  That said, they might take the kid in with open arms because it's from your sister.  (I don't get people.) You family sound like a bunch of narcissistics. I’m sorry you’re going through this; as mentioned before you’re not obligated to take on any burden, hypothetical or otherwise. You’re not obligated to sign anything either. I’m not sure what your relation to your sister is, but cut off contact with your family and this toxicity ASAP! 

You’ve got enough to handle o your plate, drama like this is draining an unnecessary. I recommend checking out raisedbynarcistists subreddit to get a support network on the personal end.  In your situation, you can at any time, if you feel it's necessary, to get a restraining order out on the people pressuring you "legally" when they have been basically harassing you about a baby that's not even born yet! "Guardian" legally means you would be responsible for the child regularly, and IF they just want you to sign it IN CASE THEY for whatever reason do pass, their would be litigation to decide who the child would go to, and obviously if the court appoints, you as the aunt, you can always reject the responsibility. However, it sounds like this is a "let's see if she will do it" type agreement with the baby shower and past treatment of you, seems like harassment to me. If you were to file a restraining order against your parents and sibling and spouse, they would not legally be able to bother you about this or anything else, ever, or they will face legal issues. If there is something else in this case- such as these parents plan on having you raise it from something you signed in their will, well that's just kind of messed up since they are really being irresponsible with the baby's life and yours as well. This isn't a normal thing to ask someone at this time I would think. I have 2 kids and don't have a will nor anybody legally to "guard" them if we died. It's not something you really think about, unless you are trying to "rope" others in to parental responsibility. Sounds way out of bounds. [removed] [deleted] Not related to your legal advice post, but contact your congressman's district office if your SSDI is being denied or isn't going through. Each member has a district staff that can help cut through the red tape when a constituent has a problem with a federal agency. Go to house.gov and search with your zip code to find out who represents you. [removed] Isn't that what traditionally the role/point of godparent(s) (unless she did ask you to be godmother already like a bride would do when choosing a maid of honor, ask that person well in advance and that's just a single one day obligation. 
Like, even IF you had accepted to Bebthe kids godmother which is essentially only a meaningless ceremonial title like in baptisms or christenings. Any normal human would at LEAST ask the person about if first before you go and make it legal without your knowledge or consent. 
It's not like an inherentence where your grandma  leaves you her wedding ring and good China  Am I missing something?  Is your sister not able to parent the child?   [removed] Or are they trying to get you to share costs of parties and gifts? Many people feel that special occasions are a good time to buy what they want & get others to pay — at least in part.  "And my children will be divided evenly among my siblings." They want me to sign some "godparent clause" on a will, should I just avoid doing that? Is that legally binding? I'm kind of being pressured right now, but I know I wouldn't be a fit parent. I honestly don't want anything from them, and as soon as my husband and I move we won't be in contact with them anymore. Hell even property can't be forced on someone through a will. Jesus...I was feeling really shitty about my injuries and suddenly it's not so bad.   I knew there were people that certainly had it worse,  but I felt overwhelmed just reading your post.  

 That's a really thoughtful message. Thank you.  Holy bananas. I’ll be fully wheelchair bound eventually, (I have EDS), and I’m starting to use a wheelchair a couple of days a month. It’s scary to see all the costs laid out like that! I knew all those things were coming, but I haven’t thought about them in terms of costs. I guess at least in my case, I have time as I slowly lose functions. Thanks for the post! :) And be warned about waiting times, time to bill, etc. I work in medical equipment, a power chair is a nightmare for a company not prepared to handle it. Do your research and find a well-established company that is IN NETWORK for your insurance. Even that can be a cluster, a friend of mine had to wait for over a year for his chair due to billing, etc. Best of luck OP--loss of mobility is no joke. Solid advice from u/anotherjunkie > Are you doing okay emotionally? I have some advice I share with the people I talk to about how to get back on track mentally after becoming disabled, but I don’t want to overstep if you have everything under control. Your post makes it sound like you probably do.

I would like to hear your advice, if you wouldn't mind sharing.

Your post was really spot on, on so many details.

I want to re-emphasize to /u/jane_of_the_jungle that even people who you would think are most definitely disabled, are declined the first time. The lawyer that I spoke with stated that it is a default option for them (maybe just in my state, i don't know) as many people, even those who are legitimately disabled do not pursue it. 

It also "forces" people to get a lawyer and basically the lawyers generally know if you have a case or not, so if a lawyer will not take an individual, that person also drops off, saving social security time and money.

What this means for you is that this can be a pretty time consuming process, where you have to live off the money that you have... or consider a loan, if you need it. 

The thing is that all of the money you are entitled too will be retroactive to when you first filed, if you are approved. While you do not want to put yourself in a further hole, if you need it, make some calculations, include the 25% (or whatever fee your lawyer would take, I am pretty sure it is a standard 25% iirc) and do what you need to do.

PS. I really love your user ID /u/jane_of_the_jungle  God bless - great info. I have a friend with hubby in a scooter/chair after a stroke in mid 40-s. I have learned so much about accessibility in the past 12 years. The legal minimums aren't even close to what is practical or necessary.  I think you dropped a "not" there > This isn't a normal thing to ask someone at this time I would think. 

I disagree. When I was 6-7 months pregnant, we decided to draw up living wills and other legal paperwork. This was only a few years after the Terri Schiavo case and I was entering into a potentially dangerous part of my pregnancy, so it made sense for my husband and I to have that “what if” conversation and put our plans in writing. That led to discussions about who we would prefer care for our child if something happens to both of us.  

Maybe it’s because I work with wills, trusts and EoL documents often for work but this seems like a natural thing to do.  [deleted] Dude, that's just brutal.

 Yeah, you missed the part where this is in case the parents die. OP is asking about the legal implications of being put into a will, seems like this is the exact place they'd want to ask that question.  It's what King Solomon would have wanted. Three children among four siblings, no problem. (NAL) Should something happen to the child’s parents the authorities will act in the best interests of the child. Under no circumstances could that ever involve forcing the child on people who are neither willing nor able to care for him/her merely because at some point in the past they agreed to or were pressured into agreeing to. Don't sign it.  Even if you DID, every "contract" has to have consideration. I.e. you would need to get something in exchange for agreeing to do this thing.  EVEN IF that clause had consideration and was signed of your own free will, it's still not valid because again, children are not property and if both parents died, child protective services will ASK you if you are able and willing to take the child(ren) in.  The clause might lead them to look at you more favorably than another, but if you say no, that's it.  Don’t sign. Say no.  The only people who sign a Will are the testator and the testator’s witnesses.  Guardians, executors and beneficiaries don’t sign Wills.  So they’re likely trying to get you to sign something else. Be very, very careful about this. Godparents are different things than guardians, so you need to be clear about what’s being asked of you here.

If you are feeling pressured to sign something, that’s coercion, and you’re not supposed to sign documents if you’re being coerced.  Coercion can make a document invalid, but it takes a bit to prove coercion.  Better to just not sign it at all, and you can get a lawyer to help you NOT sign a document.

Here’s how:

Say to your family “of course, since this is a legal thing, I’ll need to get a lawyer to help me with it, and I’m sure you can understand that we’re a little strapped for cash at the moment, so if you’d be willing to pay for my lawyer to review it with me, I’d be happy to take a look at it....”.  That, all by itself, usually shuts this stuff down.  If they keep pressuring you to sign, just keep repeating “I’d love to take a look if you’d pay for my lawyer’s time”. 

If they agree to pay, find a really good, independent lawyer (not the one drafting the documents), have the family bring you to the appointment and make them pay for an hour of the lawyer’s time UP FRONT (this part is important, because their paying your bill is an element of coercion, and they won’t want to pay after).  When you make the appointment, make sure they know that someone else will be paying for the consultation up front, so they don’t say “oh, that’s ok, you can pay after”.  If you can talk to the lawyer before the appointment, to explain the situation, even better.

When you get to the lawyer’s office, remind the receptionist that your family would like to pay for the appointment up front, to get that part out of the way.  If the family or the receptionist says “oh, just pay later”, you say “no, let’s just get it all cleared up now, so it’s done”.   If they refuse to pay then, you say to the receptionist “gosh, I’m really sorry, but it looks like we’ve wasted your time... my family said they would pay for this consultation because I can’t afford to myself. We’ll have to cancel.”

If they pay, go in with the lawyer, but go in by yourself, or with your hubby if he has come along, and fully explain everything to them, especially the part about feeling coerced into signing this document. Any lawyer worth their salt will want to see you by yourself, and will recommend you don’t sign the document if you are being coerced, or if you really don’t want to get involved in whatever is going on. Your lawyer is there to protect you.

Ask the lawyer to tell your family that given your situation, they don’t feel signing that document would be in the child’s best interest or yours, so they recommend you not sign it.  Then the family can get mad, but they’ll get mad at the lawyer, not you.  If the lawyer won’t speak to the family, then you just tell the family “I’m really sorry, but the lawyer said I shouldn’t sign this under the circumstances.” Either way, argument over.

BTW, if they do appoint you as a guardian in a Will, you can ALWAYS refuse the appointment.  Just because someone names you in a Will doesn’t mean you need to accept.

Good luck! Don't sign anything. 

Also, not from a legal perspective, obviously, but I would consider going no contact with these wretches of humanity. You deserve much more than what they have provided.  Do not sign it. Avoid it like the plague.  If you want nothing to do with them.. why are you stressing about saying no?  NAL, but it's pretty good rule of thumb to never sign anything you don't know about without consulting an attorney. Also I have some tangential  experience with how this stuff works because my mother is a social worker. This may not be the case where you are, but usually they contact the family first, then they assess whether they are allowed to place the child with that guardian. A few months back my mother  had the lovely experience of being constantly subpoenaed by a family who wanted their grandchild after Grandpa was denied custody because he had issues with his background check. If someone is not willing or able they will not foist the kid on you. Now this is only how it works in MA, but I would be shocked if it wasn't similar in every other state. No, tell them firmly you are unable to take care of a child at this point in time with your injuries. I have occasional depression and I felt I couldn’t take my sisters children. This is too much stress on you, put yourself first. They couldn’t give a damn about you and your recovery before , now you’re expected to step up!?  Fuck. That. Noise. I actually recommend No Contact with those unempathic fucks. How are you supposed to take care of someone else’s kid when you aren’t even recovered from your accident? Fellow Zebra!

It’s terrifying and overwhelming. The wheelchair van is the biggest issue, though. If you can find a way to get a good one for cheap you’ll be set for years. It’s sad to say, but you can often get good deals from a compassionate family when their loved one has passed away. My family essentially gave away a $40k van years ago (before I needed it, of course).

Everything else is day-to-day. Living alone is essentially impossible if you can’t work — even aside from the fact that you may need help doing things. 

It’s a big adjustment, but you’ll be fine! One of the most important things is to start finding hobbies and things you enjoy doing that can be done from a wheelchair/couch/bed.

*Also, a big thank you to the mods for being so permissive here. I’ve had a number of people reach out for help privately, and I’m really glad they were able to.* > The thing is that all of the money you are entitled too will be retroactive to when you first filed, if you are approved. 

Theoretically, but I had a relative go through this and the entire process took something like 5 years and in the end the judge for the case made them settle for 50% of what was owed and then the lawyer took their cut. It might go faster for someone with an obvious, visible disability though.  I did.  Fixed. I think it's normal, if you're going to have a kid you should have plans as to what happens under certain circumstances if you die. But definitely abnormal to ask your severely disabled sister who you abandoned in her time of need. [removed] King Solomon solved this problem a long time ago. How does consideration work in cases where the child is wanted but nothing else comes with them? Is the child themself the consideration? So wouldn't it be a good idea for OP to sign it? It placates the parents and keeps OP's options open because they have better consideration once they sign and as you said it doesn't stop them from refusing despite signing. > The only people who sign a Will are the testator and the testator’s witnesses. Guardians, executors and beneficiaries don’t sign Wills. So they’re likely trying to get you to sign something else. 

This.  Something's fishy here. Wow. 5 years! I am sorry that your relative went through that. That is certainly not the norm, from my experience... and really shitty that s/he was penalized due to the length of time.

At the time that I went through this, the norm in my area was 1.5 to 2 years. I had heard of some people having to wait for 3. I have no idea what things could happen to make it 5. That makes me very sad as the disabled are a vulnerable group and not everyone has a support group. For some, 5 years would be too long. 1.5 years is too long!

I hope that your relative is doing ok. Take care. I agree that part is abnormal but the post I was replying to implied that drawing up those plans in general isn’t normal.  That’s what I disagreed with.  [deleted] Children can't be consideration, nor can you put something as consideration for something concerning the child.

They're not property, property law doesn't matter in the slightest here.

They're not a service/job, job law doesn't matter in the slightest here.

They're children, there's absolutely no part of contract law that can affect them like that. The closest you can get is that you can leave property "to the guardian if the child". This does not let you stipulate who that is (although you can certainly out your preference into the will, and while it's not legally binding it's a good start to getting that person guardianship) but it can ensure that whoever it is that does become the guardian has the things needed to care for them. This is usually something like an amount of money or a house or something.

You can do that stuff in two ways, in a general "this is for the care if the child" sort of way, which any monetary leavings are normally assumed to be, to my knowledge, which means it has to be used in the best interests of the child (not that a smart person couldn't get around that. Normally it's only idiots who try though). The other is to specify that it's totally theirs to do with as they wish (often this is paired with the other sort when it's given) and then it's really the same as leaving someone anything specifically, but you don't set the actual receiver. NAL

I'm fairly sure it doesn't work like that, the contract is just considered invalid if one party doesn't have consideration. So in this case the contract isn't binding, whether they want the child or not.

Edit: however like the poster above said, a child isn't property to be traded so the contract would be void anyway.  It's never a good idea to sign something under duress.  Sure, it "placates" them - but also gives them the incorrect idea that they CAN stomp all over OP's boundaries.  Best to say no, full stop, right now.
