[CO][ADA]Parking attendant directing contractor trucks to park on handicap-reserved spaces So this is an underground parking lot for a private company. When we arrived this morning we noticed a big truck parked over a couple of handicap spaces and the median zebra lines. 

We have a kid in a wheelchair and it's always frustrating to see that, so my wife went to talk to the parking attendant, whose reply was that this was a contractor truck, and that the contractor was asked to park on those spaces so as not to block visitor spaces.

We were flabbergasted by that answer, and we argued that it was not legal, but he said this was a private parking lot so they could do that.

Is he right? Are parking spots reserved for handicapped just a suggestion when it's a private parking lot?

We are looking to escalate this because we feel it's complete bullshit, but we would like to know if we can actually say "no what you are doing is illegal and you need to stop".

Additionally, who could enforce this? The police? That would likely be considered Public Accommodations under title 3 of the ADA and it would be illegal to pro there. What was the facility you were visiting? An owner of a private parking facility may request the installation of official signs or pavement markings designating spots as reserved for the disabled; that request waives any objection to the police enforcing the disabled parking rules.

"(d) A person who observes a violation of this section may submit evidence, including a sworn statement, concerning the violation to any law enforcement agency."

So I can take a picture/video and submit that to the cops?
 Yes.
