Anyone been to Kentucky Kingdom? Has anyone here been to Kentucky Kingdom?  My best friend and I are going to go sometime this summer, and I'm really excited!  However, I'm worried about how large the park is.  I looked it up and it said it is 64 acres, but I have no idea what that is in terms of walking distance from ride to ride and such.  Anyone here able to share some input?

I have chronic back pain and standing for long periods of time is very painful.  So I'm definitely concerned about the distance of the park, though walking is easier than standing still, and then of course the standing still in line.  Do their ride lines move relatively fast?  I'm wondering if I should consider the dreaded wheelchair rental or something... I do *not* want to have to do that, though.  I just *hate* being the "weak" one!!  I know using one doesn't *actually* mean you're weak, but I'm sure you guys get what I mean.  I know my friend would have zero problems with it because we are extremely close and she's been with me through everything and visa versa.  It's really *me* who is the most put off by it, lol.

Also, I know the roller coasters will screw with my back too and it scares the crap out of my parents for me to ride them, but they are so fun!!  Plus I am technically allowed to ride them, medically, though it definitely isn't high up on the list of recommended things to do with a crappy spine.  üòÇ  I also have pain medication I will likely be popping like candy during our trip, but totally worth it for a super fun weekend in my opinion! Iv never been there but id just swallow my pride and take the wheelchair.  If your in to much pain from walking everything else is gunna suck and you'll be paying for it for days (on top of pain from the coasters and fun stuff) plus if you aren't used to walking alot it will also mess up your feet and a bunch of muscles you don't use regularly.  When in doubt wheel about!  I've been to many amusement parks, but not that one.

What matters most is your comfort.  Is not having a chair going to cause you enough pain to make you miserable during the day and lessen the fun of your trip?  If so, then consider a chair.

If you do decide to use a chair, consider getting a disability pass to go with it.  I don't know that park's policy but Cedar Fair requires those in wheelchairs to have one since some rides require you go in an alternate entrance.  You can only obtain one at guest relations at the front of the park. Hey, littletrashpanda77, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Thanks for your input!  I walk a lot and have a low dose of pain meds to allow me to do every day tasks that would otherwise be impossible for me.  So I'm in decent shape, but I do have a bad nerve in my foot either from a neuroma or my back issues but docs aren't sure which and I'm not willing to let them do more surgery to find out.  I'm going to look and see if they do wheelchair rentals/how much they are.  I definitely don't want to have to find one elsewhere and rent it or anything since I don't have one of my own.  Plus I don't want to spend an arm and a leg renting one for two days! I just called them today and learned that they have a special boarding pass (I think the same as what you are describing) for people with disabilities so I won't have to stand in line for the rides, which will be SOOO helpful! If you have a doctor's note a lot of amusement parks offer them for free Oh wow, really??  I had no idea that was a thing!  The last time I was at an amusement park, my issues didn't prevent me from being able to do things like they do now.  I will definitely look up their policies!  I know my doctor would be more than willing to write a note for me and I see her again relatively soon.  Thank you for letting me know! Check on their website,  they usually say if they are free,  it's usually wherever the stroller info is (that's not demeaning or anything) Lol you're right, it was with the stroller info.  But it says it is on a first come first serve basis and is $10 a day for a manual and $38 for an electric chair.  That's crazy expensive for the electric chair!!  I mean, at least it seems that way to me since I've never rented one for a day before.  I wonder how many chairs they have available if it is first come first serve... You can call and ask. If you are going with friends just make them push you in the manual.  I mean what are friends for?  Lol oh I definitely would üòÇ  In exchange I could let her take turns sitting if she needed to later or something.  I was just shocked at *how much* they charge for the electric rental for a day!  I will call and ask for sure.  I mean, $20 isn't awful.  And if one day was spent in the waterpark area, I likely wouldn't need it if we stayed in the water most of the time since that takes weight off of the spine anyway.  I guess we will see!  good luck and I hope you have lots of fun!  Rental EVCs take a LOT of abuse by guests and also cause damage to park infrastructure.  Then you need to take into account the parking space they take up, someone has to recharge them every night, they need infrastructure to be housed, and an attendant to staff the rental location.  If they were cheap, they would sell out quickly leaving guests who really need one out of luck an hour or two after opening. The high price stinks, but it also seems understandable to me.

 Thank you!  I hope so too!  üòÅ I know they aren't as simple as a fold up manual chair, but for people who *actually* need them and could provide medical documentation to back that up, I wish they could at least knock it down to a more reasonable price.  And I dont really see how they *damage* the park...?
