Disability discrimination in the (ex)workplace Nottingham, UK. 

I am what I call a "most of the time" wheelchair user. I can get around a little bit without the wheelchair, but not enough to really do much. The only time I go out without it is if I absolutely have to go to somewhere that isn't accessible, or job interviews.

I had a job interview mid-september, and this was one of the days I didn't take the chair as I'm always automatically discounted for the role if I go in them. I was, however, very open and upfront with the fact that I am a wheelchair user, and most likely will be turning up to work in the wheelchair. It was a book shop, and the entire shop floor and stock room was wheelchair accessible. 

I got the job (woo!) and signed a zero hour contract.

Turn up to my first shift, and they all seem super shocked and off with me. I was very capable of doing the job, and can actually carry more books at one time (super efficient) than non-wheelies. Basically, I'm good at the job. 

I then got diagnosed with the mumps, and with full sick note, had to miss my second shift. This was completely unrelated to the wheelchair. 

I emailed a copy of the sick note, and my availability over the next two weeks which was pretty much me being free every day. 

No reply. 

Emailed again at the end of my sick note with availability and saying "I'm out of quarantine now" 

No reply. 

Called the store manager to find out when I would next be in. 

No reply. 

Went into store and spoke to her, she told me to email her, which I did. 

Still no reply. 

It's obviously not cool for that to happen, but do I have any options to report this as discrimination?  Might want to try /r/LegalAdviceUK/  ---
