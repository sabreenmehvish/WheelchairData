Is pedestrian access included in the ADA? Not long ago I went to a major chain restaurant with a friend who was in a wheelchair. As the restaurant was just across the street and down the block from where we were staying, we took the sidewalk. It was then that we discovered that the sidewalk loops around the property in a way which never provides access to the building. The road is the only way onto the property, and is heavily trafficked, it would be suicide to attempt to get onto the property via road without a vehicle.

Would the ADA cover access for patrons not using a vehicle? If so, should I try contacting corporate to rectify the problem first, or should I just go ahead and file a complaint with the DOJ?

Edit: This is in Michigan. I knew better, and still forgot to include it.

Edit2: There seems to be some confusion as to the layout. I attempted a shitty ms paint, but it was too shitty. Have an aerial view of the property instead. https://imgur.com/a/MbzWAO3 The place where the sidewalk runs right up against the parking lot has an extreme height difference, and is intraversable without parkour skills. Are we talking curb ramps or sidewalks in general? Would curb ramps have solved the problem? It's hard to visualize what you're describing (at least for me).

LocationBot 4.300172817 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) Curb ramps would have done nothing to help the situation. I updated with an aerial view of the property to clear things up. You can contact the DOT (not the DOJ) but while I'm no expert, that doesn't seem like a violation. Doesn't hurt to try though. I tried digging through ADA forms and regulations, but couldn't find anything that touches on this. DOT is a good idea. Good luck. It looks like this isn't really designed for any pedestrian access... not every place is accessible on foot. That would be the first step.
