Typical Friday problems  All the years I have had my wheelchair, never has this happened to me... sorry about the chair mate! I have solid tires on the front wheels of my chair and I’ve had them wear down to the point of almost falling apart before now but it’s still more useable at the ‘it’s broken and imminently needs replacing’ point than this. Is it not possible to get solids for your chair? I feel they are definitely harder wearing. Really? This happenes probably once to twice a year to me. And yes I think its time I get a spare  Those tires make my back hurt because the impact goes up through my spine Honestly, never has happened to me and I use my wheelchair for the most craziest things going places a wheelchair probably shouldn't so a surprise here for me...
