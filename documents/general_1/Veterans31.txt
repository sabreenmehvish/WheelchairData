Memorial day.. Loosing it So its Yom Hazikaron in  my home country. Or Memorial day. I lost 2 older brothers in the army. I lost my leg in 2014. Today has been absolute shit. i have been upset all day. Ive cried. I have been pissed. Ive lost my temper.  But more than anything i have sat in my wheelchair looking at my Miv'tza Tzuk Eitan combat pin (The war i was in) looking at my brothers photos. Looking at my old boot. Memorial days are never easy for me. But this year its the worst. My middle brother died 10 years ago this july. More or less i just feel like shit. Nothing can bring  my brothers back. Nothing can bring my best friend back. Nothing can bring my leg back.  I wish i was one of the dead. There is nothing worse than being the only surviving brother who has let his wife and daughter down, who has let everyone down. Who cant find it in him to compose himself. Fuck this shit. Fuck it all. It gets harder and harder. Time doesn't heal me. I have started to work on my PTSD but its not easy. I slept for the first time in a week last night. Better than i have in a while. My wife helped me into my wheelchair this morning and i was upbeat and happy to play with my daughter and start my day. Until i saw what day it was.  I have done what i could to stop the tears. I cant. This day sucks ass. if there is some sort of afterlife i hope my brothers are well. I know i am not. I wish i died that summer day. I wouldnt have to deal with all this. All the nightmares. All the times i wake up screaming. All the scars on my back and chest. My loss of hearing (Its still somewhat there) my leg being amputated. Ill never understand why some of us dont live and some of us do. I dont know why i lived and my brothers died. I dont know why my country is soaked in blood. I dont know what the hell is going to happen to me, or my family. A war is brewing and my baby sis is still in the army. Were going to run out of graveyards sooner or later. Whatever the case i hope that all the suffering was worth it Netanyahu. Fuck you. Fuck the defense minister for sending my unit without adequate supplies or reconnaissance. Fuck you Sharon and Olmert for sending my brothers to die. Good job. Our nation is soaked in the blood of those who didn't even have a chance to live and never will. I was proud to serve my country. I would do it again. But none of this had any long term affect. It wont matter. My daughter will fight in the same wars i did. May all my friends and brothers be of זיכרונה לברכה (Blessed memory)  I should've joined you. I guess im stuck here now. 
Sorry for the rant. I just cant deal with this mess. I need to find it in me to stay strong for my wife and kid. But i dont think i will forever. Ive been trying to listen to music all day. Which has helped me a bit. Sorry for the long post. Often times in the lives of humans we let ourselves be defined by externals, but this is only truly harmful to those who have never defined themselves internally, because without this internal definition, this laying out of who we are as defined by what we value most in the universe around us, without this, external definitions become the only thing we are and this is a horrible place to be.

When I find myself in a dark place, defined by things external to myself which leave me little control or direction in my own life, I look again at my internal definition of myself, my definition of the universe around me and when those are again refreshed in my mind, the external things loose their power because the master context of my life is switched back to those things most important -- *valuable* -- to me and my life.

If you don't have your own base definition of yourself, only just some awkward feeling of self left over from times past, then I envy you your task, for you get to build your definition in your immediate future, while mine was built so long ago -- not yet complete, but then I'm not yet dead.

Build your definition of yourself. There are many ways to do this. One thing which was most helpful to me at the age of twenty-two when I found it was this warrior's book, ["A Happy Death"](http://www.amazon.com/Happy-Death-Albert-Camus/dp/0679764003/ref=sr_1_12?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1462934061&sr=1-12&keywords=albert+camus) for it helped me understand that morals need not be religious, that self-interest and care was not selfishness, and that to live your life with the purpose of becoming the best human you can be is the most honorable way to die, and if you were [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi), well, the answer would be the same. [His book](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Five-Rings-Miyamoto-Musashi/dp/1935785974/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1462934580&sr=1-3&keywords=book+of+five+rings) tells a warrior's tale, too.

Accept that you were a warrior then, that you're a warrior now, and only the battle has changed. Build your self, it's your primary tool and will let you permanently put the externalities in their proper perspective.

Best wishes, warrior. Your pain is universal. You're not alone in the way you feel and some of us understand entirely. 

I commend you for working on your PTSD. I hope that writing this was cathartic for you and you continue to write if it helps get the thoughts and feelings out. 
 Talked with you a couple weeks ago, thinking of you tomorrow. Thats really interesting. Thanks. The fact is that i cant feel like this forever. I need to build my self back up and become a better father and husband. I can do it. I just need to push myself. Ill look into that book. My English isnt 100 percent but i should gets the idea of it Thanks.  You can do it, but do it for *yourself* first; others will benefit from your strength indirectly.

Also, Albert Camus was French and so his work is available in French foremost, but has been widely translated around the planet so you can probably find translations for your native language. Perhaps starting with ["The Myth of Sisyphus"](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Other-Essays/dp/0679733736/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1462972763&sr=1-1&keywords=the+myth+of+sysiphus) might be a better choice since it's not a work of fiction that needs interpretation by the reader, but is instead a collection of essays which are much less allegorical, which can become muddled and lost in translations.

Just remember that a warrior's attitude towards life is a [valiant](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/valiant) one.
