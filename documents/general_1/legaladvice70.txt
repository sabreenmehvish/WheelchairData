(US) Can you feasibly not hire a specific class because the job would be dangerous to them? Ex: a pizza joint not hiring women to deliver because of their location No. You can't discriminate against a protected class because you think it's dangerous for them to do it. That's sexist/racist, and definitely illegal. If someone thinks the job is too dangerous, they won't apply for it. They don't need you looking out for them.

Unless you have less than 15 employees, then you can pretty much hire whoever you want because discriminatory hiring laws don't apply to you. How is it unsafe for women and not men?

And yes that is illegal discrimination. Guys get raped and beaten the same as girls.  To elaborate on others' answers: you can discriminate on an individual basis if you have a bona fide, legally-acceptable argument that there is no "reasonable accommodation" that would allow them to perform the job. 

A fire department can "discriminate" against people in wheelchairs because there is no *reasonable* accommodation that can be made that will enable a person confined to a wheelchair to perform, safely and economically, the job duties of a fire-fighter (ditto a football player, but not, say, the accountant for a football team). That's a generic example -- every specific example will need to be evaluated specifically. "Women are more at risk than men in pizza delivery" may be, arguably, true, but unless hiring women drivers *requires* pizza companies to institute accommodations that are determined to be unreasonable, discriminating against women drivers would be unlawfully discriminatory. 

The key here is that employers can have experts make the *arguments* for them but can't make the decisions based on their own personal opinions/professional experience/whatever -- only the courts/governments can make the final determination as to whether an accommodation is unreasonable.  ---

>Ex: a pizza joint not hiring women to deliver because of their location There was a story in AskReddit about a week ago where the drivers were all male after one female driver had to go to a sketchy part of town and was kidnapped and raped for three days. I was wondering if that was legally possible.  Thank you.  If it is a small, independent store with under 15 people, yes.

Otherwise, no. Unless all the women voluntarily quit and the only qualified people who applied for the positions were men. No, it wouldn't fly.

The delivery company could stop delivering to that hood. However, "fear of potential rape and therefore I won't hire women" isn't in-bounds. Thank you.  Thank you.  When your cats rubs up against you, she is actually marking you as "hers" with her scent. If your cat pushes his face against your head, it is a sign of acceptance and affection. Thank you.
