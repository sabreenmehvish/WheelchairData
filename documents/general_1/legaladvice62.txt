Am I required to Provide an ASL Interpreter I run a very small business teaching firearms safety classes. I do about $6000 in sales annually and do not turn a profit. I  have a student who is asking for an interpreter for an upcoming class. The cost of the interpreter is nearly all the money my business currently has. 

An online resource said the requirement is dependent on the cost of the aid or service relative to their size, overall financial resources, and overall expenses. In general, a business or nonprofit with greater resources is expected to do more to ensure effective communication than one with fewer resources. 

Am I required to pay for an interpreter?  I am located in Wisconsin. 

Thank you In the circumstances you've described, providing an interpreter at your expense would be an ['undue burden'](http://www.ada.gov/t3hilght.htm) ('Auxiliary aids' includes interpreters)

>Auxiliary aids that would result in an undue burden, (i.e., "significant difficulty or expense") or in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the goods or services are not required by the regulation. 

However, if they ask to bring an interpreter of their own you should allow them--and not charge the interpreter for the class.  Or if they have another accommodation that *would* be reasonable, you should allow that.  

If you're very concerned about this, you could contact the [ADA and ask for clarification.](http://www.ada.gov/contact_drs.htm) Your customer could bring their own interpreter, which I believe you'd need to allow to attend the course without an additional charge. You are not required to provide one at your own expense. No, you don't. The fact that it's not a requirement makes obtaining a concealed handgun permit trickier for deaf people. Because of this, there are actually organizations dedicated specifically to firearm classes for deaf folks, [conducted entirely in ASL](http://www.allcancarry.com/). Unfortunately, I don't know of any in Wisconsin. If you want the student in your class, perhaps you could find an alternative to an expensive professional interpreter.  


I'd explain the situation to the student - that you want them to be able to enjoy the class, but you simply can't afford to hire a professional interpreter at full cost - and see if they have a friend or relative they can bring to interpret, who you'll let attend for free.


If that's not an option, you can contact some local deaf charities and see if there's any help available, and another option is advanced-level ASL students, who may do it for cheap or for free.


If you're not going to be hiring a professional, I would let whoever is going to be interpreting attend a class beforehand so that they can take notes and be prepared for the actual interpretation (this would be a good idea for a professional too, though if they're *really* a pro they can do it on the fly).   (I say this as a professional translator who does some interpretation every so often - preparation makes a huge difference.)


Is there a sizeable deaf community in your area?  Since another commenter said there doesn't seem to be any firearms safety classes for the deaf around there, if you can figure this out you could easily turn it into an opportunity to expand your market base and begin serving the deaf community too. This is not a great forum to ask this question because legaladvice really struggles with getting ADA accommodation right. Your best bet is to contact the Disability Rights Section or the Department of Justice directly to ask them.  You may be able to get by with a copy of the written materials- basically everything the instructor would be saying. This would help accommodate the disability and is less likely to place an undue burden on your business.  Could OP create an in-depth PowerPoint or guide book and that follows his course outline instead?  

Since this is a firearms class, can we reasonably assume the person is not visually impaired as well? Not legal advice because you've gotten that. After chiming in on many sub comments I have a compromise you could offer the Deaf person. 

I'd suggest preparing as much written material written in Simple English (see Wikipedia articles in Simple English to get an idea) and have a one-on-one class with the Deaf person. You would likely be focusing most of your attention on that person anyways to ensure they are understanding the material it likely would affect the other participants. This way you can ensure the Deaf person is understanding what you're communicating and ensure safety because you'd have eyes on them the entire time.

If the Deaf person is insistent that you provider and interpreter I would suggest that you provide it or consult with an actual attorney who could defend you in the event that the Deaf person files a suit against you.  A practical aside: if an interpreter is not an option, and you aren't legally obligated to provide one, either, could you provide some kind of written instruction that this person could follow?

Patently untrue. Source: I'm deaf and have won a suit against a business for not providing an interpreter.

 > You are not required to provide one at your own expense.

That is incorrect.  ADA requires businesses  to provide accommodations at their own expense.  

 This is completely irrelevant to OP's post and your response, but are deaf folks required to wear hearing protection at the shooting range? I'd never thought about it before.  OP, I love all of these suggestions listed above but one. Please don't look for advanced-level or any level ASL students to interpret. They're still students who are still learning and are not yet professional interpreters. 
As a personal anecdote, I'm an ASL interpreter and I can't think of anyone, including myself, who would've been ready to interpret a firearms safety class before graduating. The content is very specialized, with very specific terminology and signs associated.  Written instructions are not suitable for many Deaf people because they are not fluent in English. I've asked Deaf people to spell the word of a sign if I don't know it and very frequently they cannot. They can describe the word essentially by definition but they do not associate each sign with a written English word. In the same vein, I have had Deaf people ask me what a written word is in a news story and I tell them the sign.  Any business that serves the public is a place of public accommoation.  You don't have to accept government money.   I have a question. Why can't a business ask a deaf person to bring their own interpreter, or bear some of the cost? I've heard stories of interpreters working at concerts or comedy events where the venue actually loses money on that seat because the hired the interpreter. I meant that in this case it would be an undue burden on the business and the client would have to bring their own if they wanted. But the issue is what if the business has no money? 

I can see it now, OP hires interpreter, and as the gun safety class begins he shuts the business down and sends everyone home because his business is now over. 

I mean that's obviously dramatic and it takes a long time to close a business, but is OP supposed to go bankrupt? Isn't there a common ground? You can't expect OP to somehow make more money suddenly in order to afford someone. So what's the solution then? 

I'm honestly asking! What's the solution? Kickstarter? 

Are ASL interneters to be (still in training) cheaper to hire?  Except when it is an undue burden on the business. I don't think any states require hearing protection at a shooting range.

but it would be unwise for a deaf person to go without ear protection

[Other symptoms of a ruptured eardrum include:](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/ruptured-eardrum-symptoms-and-treatments?page=2)

*    Sudden sharp ear pain or a sudden decrease in ear pain  
*    Drainage from the ear that may be bloody, clear, or resemble pus  
* X    Ear noise or buzzing  
*    Hearing loss that may be partial or complete in the affected ear  
*    Episodic ear infections  
*    Facial weakness or dizziness  

most of the symptoms would be unpleasant even without being able to hear. I'm deaf and have visited gun ranges before, they absolutely require you to wear ear protection anyway. Your eardrum can still rupture from the noise. Probably a good idea regardless. Deaf folks are more likely to seriously hurt their ears around loud noises, which may have impact ranging from nothing to long term pain and/or tinnitus. As some who is hard of hearing, I wear hearing protection at a shooting range. For what it's worth.  In their case, it's "ear protection" not "hearing protection" Even with a prep session?  > Written instructions are not suitable for many Deaf people because they are not fluent in English.

I get that ASL is a very different language than English, but does this mean that a lot of Deaf people aren't actually literate?  I know that ASL and spoken English have different structures and I could understand why they'd take longer to learn to read because of that, but why don't they learn? Isn't teaching them written words essentially the same process as teaching them signs, or teaching a hearing person a foreign language? Are you saying most deaf people in the US can't read English? How is that even possible? They go to school like anyone else, it seems like a complete dereliction to fail tomteach them to read. How would they reddit?


Edit - Wanted to also ask. If deaf people aren't fluent in English, that is because they were poorly educated, right, not because they are deaf.  So wouldn't that be an accommodation that is not covered by ADA, like providing French or Chinese interpretation? So of OP provided all written material to his students, a deaf person could not request an accomodation for the fact they didn't learn English.

Edit again -  This http://www.ada.gov/effective-comm.htm from the Justice department seems to indicate that providing written material to cover a stock speech is appropriate accommodation. This is true, don't know why you were downvoted. Bakery near me lost their case a year or two ago when they refused to make a cake for a lesbian couple. Local business, low revenue, no government help, owed hundreds of thousands to the couple. It's essentially asking them to pay for being disabled. People always liken it to asking a wheelchair bound person to pay a toll to use the ramp, having your business equally accessible to all kinds of clients is part of running a business, it costs money to build the ramp, it costs money to hire interpreters for those customers. 

In the case of the concert venue, it's not an undue burden to lose money on one seat when they sell a thousand. And while it would be more money for the venue to sell that seat to a hearing person, this would fall under the "protected class" discrimination laws (don't know how to phrase that, still not a lawyer) Correct.   Thanks. I know it's not legally required, but all the ranges I've shot at have mandatory "eyes & ears" PPE rules. After thinking some more about it, I should have realised that tympanic rupture could still occur in a deaf person. > As some who is hard of hearing, I wear hearing protection at a shooting range. For what it's worth.

Going to a shooting range without wearing hearing protection is one way of quickly becoming hard of hearing. Even with a prep session, I still disagree with it. A prep session could give a student time to learn a couple new signs and maybe a bit of background info, but it's still highly unlikely they'd be ready to accurately and effectively interpret. It's not as simple as knowing information, it's also the ability to receptively understand the deaf person, expressively put out the right information and do it all while reading the deaf person and matching their preferred way of interpreting. And it being a group/class setting makes it more challenging. I would never advocate students interpreting as if they were professionals, but this particular venue will be too challenging for someone who hasn't even started interpreting in some of the "easier" situations yet. 

It's unprofessional from the business' standpoint and unethical from the ASL student's standpoint.  Many times they can understand the gist of a story in the newspaper but at times some do struggle with reading comprehension of written English. However, Deaf can write down their thoughts although the prose is different than English.  I have an aunt who is deaf and her Facebook posts are often hard to understand and read like someone learning English. There aren't really tenses in ASL and they don't use a lot of the filler words we use in English.  Sure it can be. However learning languages is easiest the younger you are. Unfortunately the education system and the society around them failed many older Deaf people decades ago. Imagine learning a language without speaking it or hearing it spoken. It can be done but would be very difficult at any age and especially after age 40 or 50. 

I believe our education system and society (reading the internet, texting etc) does a better job with this today. >Are you saying most deaf people in the US can't read English? How is that even possible? They go to school like anyone else, it seems like a complete dereliction to fail tomteach them to read. How would they reddit?

Reading comprehension varies wildly within the Deaf community. In general they are most comfortable communicating in ASL. That is their primary language. Many of them have not been taught written English. They get confused because to them the prose is incorrect. FWIW I believe younger Deaf people have much better reading comprehension than the generation or two before them. Not everyone reddits. 

The Deaf community that I have spent the most time around were born in the 50's and 60's. When they read newspaper articles they can get the gist of the story but may miss most of the details.

They didn't learn/ weren't taught English because of their disability. There is an entire generation plus who were failed by public and private education to be taught English related to their disability. 

>Edit again -  This http://www.ada.gov/effective-comm.htm from the Justice department seems to indicate that providing written material to cover a stock speech is appropriate accommodation.

The quote you are mentioning relates that option to a museum tour. That link also discusses choosing translations options while considering the person's with a disability's preference, the complexity of the information and importance of understanding the information. 

First, the person with the disability preference. Some Deaf people have a stronger grasp on written English than others. So OP may get another Deaf person in later who is just fine with written instructions whereas this Deaf person may only have a small grasp on written English and may not be able to understand what is written. 

Secondly, complexity of the information. I've never taken a gun safety course but I'd imagine it could use technical terms such as specific parts of the gun. An interpreter would describe the gun and where that part is on the gun instead of signing the term for that part of a gun (if there is one). 

Lastly, how important is it that the information is translated effectively to the person. A museum tour is not all the important to understand every fact communicated whereas a medical appointment or legal situation it is the utmost importance that the information is clearly communicated. So where does a gun safety class at a range fall on this spectrum? This could be up for debate. 

I truly love the Deaf community and Deaf culture. However, I would not want to have someone I care about be around a Deaf person without prior gun safety training with a gun at a range without someone who can effectively communicate with them.  
There's many many things that could go wrong. IMO, it's a big risk. If the Deaf person has finger on the trigger and flailing it around pointing at people how are you going to tell him to stop? Remember the Deaf person is there to learn about gun safety and may not know any better. You can't yell stop to a Deaf person from across the room seconds before disaster.  That's substantively different than this case.  Based on the OP's description of his business hiring an interpreter would be an "undue burden"; he runs a business in a capitalist economy and he could not financially cover the costs of an interpreter based on his revenue and business model.  Baking a cake for a lesbian couple would not be an undue burden for a bakery, it doesn't apply here.

Now if the OP had a larger business where he could cover the costs (ie hiring an interpreter may lose money on that single customer but not have a significant impact on the business as a whole) than that would not be an undue burden and he would have to eat the cost by law.  These situations do often need to be looked at on a case by case basis.  In the OP's situation, based on what he was written he would be be fine, a reasonable person would conclude hiring an interpreter would be an undue burden on his business and thus he is explicitly exempted by law.  For the bakery in your example, what "undue burden" could they claim that a reasonable person would accept (assuming homosexuals are members of a "protected class")?. > People always liken it to asking a wheelchair bound person to pay a toll to use the ramp

Isn’t it more akin to asking a wheelchair bound person to bring their own wheelchair? Considering an interpreter isn't the only way to communicate with a deaf person, it seems sort of silly to require an interpreter. Businesses aren't required by law to have someone by the door to guide blind people around.  Accommodations should be made for the disabled, of course, but considering the availability of speech to text these days it seems archaic to require a live translator. I have a hard time believing a deaf person doesn't have some form of portable speech to text program/ device considering many of my mothers students with speech handicaps or communication barriers have devices that do the opposite with them at all times.  Thank you! I never thought of it this way before.  Fair enough. > Deaf can write down their thoughts although the prose is different than English.

I had a boss who was deaf. She got a cochlear implant when she was young, but her emails sounded like they were written by an insane person.

Now I feel a little bad for judging her about that... but not *too* bad, she was still a shit manager and all-around bad person (for reasons unrelated to her deafness or poor communication). Honestly, to me this seems silly and it looks like their educators are failing them. English is my second foreign language and there are quite a lot of untranslatable concepts (conjugation and declination for starters) besides the multitude of words that have no direct pair. Still, I don't think I'd need a translator for a gun safety course. Interesting! thanks for sharing Well, gun safety information is critical, but it isn't individual in the same way medical information is, and it isn't terribly technical.  Would you suggest to the OP that he just deny this request for an interpreter, because it is unduly burdensome to his business, and not offer the alternative accommodation of written material? I would think that since written material is not burdensome, his refusal to provide it would be an ADA issue. I mean he cannot assume that it will be inappropriate given the few details he has about this customer. I was only commenting on the place of public accomodation side of it, I don't want to make any comments on the ADA side because I would surely be misinformed. No because the wheelchair is not what is making the building accessible for the person with a disability. The ramp is what makes the building accessible. Speech to text **is not** a valid interpreting service. There is *much* more that goes into ASL than just words. There are facial expressions and ways to communicate emphasis on things that cannot be communicated in English words in a way that Deaf people understand. Even video interpretation is sub-par because you can only see a portion of the body and it is 2D.  Except it doesn't really work.  For example, in this case the guy is going to have to jump through hoops to prove that his $6000/year business can't afford to hire a sign language interpreter.  If society wants to help the disabled then it should provide whatever assistance they need through charities or government  Putting the onus on business is unjust.

The other issue with this law is that in this case the disabled person isn't even going to get what they need. That is because you were taught English. Imagine trying to learn a language without speaking it or ever hearing it spoken.  >...he cannot assume that it will be inappropriate given the few details he has about this customer.

He cannot and should not equate written instructions with actual interpretation. He can offer it to the Deaf person but it is up to the Deaf person if that is reasonable accommodation for them.


This is what I suggested to OP elsewhere in the thread:

>I'd suggest preparing as much written material written in Simple English (see Wikipedia articles in Simple English to get an idea) and have a one-on-one class with the Deaf person. You would likely be focusing most of your attention on that person anyways to ensure they are understanding the material it likely would affect the other participants. This way you can ensure the Deaf person is understanding what you're communicating and ensure safety because you'd have eyes on them the entire time.

>If the Deaf person is insistent that you provider and interpreter I would suggest that you provide it or consult with an actual attorney who could defend you in the event that the Deaf person files a suit against you.  Aren’t both a ramp and a wheelchair needed? For me, the interpreter, who stays with the deaf person and is only there for this single deaf person seems far more similar to the wheelchair, which is also needed for every single wheelchair bound person and stays with them.

I know it is nit-picking to talk about the validity of comparisons, but I want to understand your point and it kind of bothers me that I don’t. Unless the deaf are either all illiterate I'm pretty sure reading is understandable to them. 

You're basically saying I won't be able to understand someone because I can't analyze their body language. Deaf people use the Internet and text. Pretty sure text is accessible. For a class? I do t know but you make it seem like they're unable to understand basic literacy.  As another ASL interpreter visiting this thread, I'm so glad you're sharing your knowledge on this topic. It's **so** frustrating when people post things as fact when they do not actually know anything about deaf people/culture/ASL. And I can't believe you're being downvoted for this when you're *completely correct*. 

You're doing an amazing job of educating people here!  You're telling me being in the same room as the human being that text to speech is transcribing, a deaf person can't also see their body language? Then why bother with subtitles? Shouldn't every show on tv have an ASL button where someone in the corner pops up? I remember my brothers HS didn't have to provide an interpreter to a deaf student, he had to pay for his own and they even didn't want to let the deaf student in. I'm not trying to marginalized deaf people but it seems insane to require a business owner to provide a translator for a class that costs around $100 to take. Stores don't have to have a person guide a blind person around. They find their own way.  there's no perfect solution though- you can't expect disabled people to carry a personal ramp or have a full time restroom helper or whatever with them. There are some disabilities that are dealt with by one solution that covers all people with that disability, like needing a wheelchair or a disabled bathroom, and there are others that need a solution specific to that one persson, like an interpreter. 

 I understand what you are saying but it also seems to me that you misunderstand disability law.

You seem to be viewing the concept of accommodation as something nice that we do for people who require something special. Something extra.

How disability law folks view it is not like that. They are saying that everyone with disabilities has the same right to access things that the rest of us do. My needs, as someone who can walk, are accommodated by stairs; they work for me. But they do not work for all people. So, the ramp is required so we accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities just as we accommodate my needs. Under this framework, when you provide a ramp to someone who cannot climb stairs, or an interpreter to someone who cannot hear, you are not providing something special, but just providing them the same service they would get irrespective of the disability.

The law gives them the right to interact commercially irrespective of disability just as other laws give us the right to interact commercially irrespective of our race or religion. It is important that we put the onus on businesses, in my opinion, because it effectuates this goal. You have a right to say to a business "hey, you have to give me the same access that you give others." Because you deserve that. Don't bathrooms have to be accessible? Isn't that cost more than a non-accessible bathroom and one that a business owner has to pay for? I think it's more comparable to learning written Chinese. The writing is still treated as somewhat independent of the chosen spoken language.

You can treat written English words as a grouping of symbols instead of representation of sounds and learn it that way. Ad and -s it means more than one of the same. Ad -ly and it means in the matter of. It's doable if you apply a somewhat different thought process to the word formation and syntax.

May be hard to impossible to get fluency, but not proficiency. I don't think that is how it works. If there are several ways to provide reasonable accommodation, doesn't the service provider get to determine which will be used? If either an elevator, or a ramp works, the building owner gets to decide, not the person in the wheelchair.  Why would the business owner have to offer a one on one class? Thiis not the service he offers, and is clearly burdensome. People who cannot do without a wheelchair need a wheelchair to actually leave the house or even move within their own home. They need a wheelchair to  'enter the world', so to say. An absent ramp just prevents them from entering a specific building, but they can go anywhere else that is wheelchair-friendly. 

Deaf people can leave their home and 'enter the world' just fine without an interpreter. They can go shopping, go to the beach and the woods, ride the bus to work, etc, all which wheelchair-bound people need their wheelchair for. The interpreter is simply the 'ramp' that allows the deaf person to 'enter' the specific 'building' that is OP's class. 

Therefore, an interpreter to a deaf person is like a ramp to a wheelchair-bound person. IMO the Deaf person is coming equipped with ASL skills. To me that is their 'wheelchair.' I have met deaf people who do not use ASL. As someone close with the Deaf community and fluent in ASL it is heartbreaking.

I was working customer service at a clothing store many years ago. A 30 or 40 something year old guy comes in, points to his ear and shakes his head no. I sign 'I know ASL. How can I help you?' He looks at me confused and shakes his head no. He pulled on his pants to indicate he was looking for pants then etched into his dark toned and dry skin his pant size. I helped him find his pants and off he went. I imagine he can communicate with his family and friends who understand his own "home made" sign language but it must be so isolating.  How do you gauge the accuracy of the specific speech to text device / program? Especially for a legally required course if it may be inaccurate? Reading is one thing, but getting the correct words is another? Likewise, if he is demonstrating something as he is talking about it, would the demonstration be missed by reading and looking back up? The potential to miss critical information or get wrong translations here seems pretty high- and while that may not be a big deal in a store where you can write what you need to /communicate one on one, that seems like s big deal in a class for dealing with dangerous weapons that could potentially kill someone. It depends on the person, to be honest. Reading English is like speaking a second language for some people who were raised using sign language exclusively. Deaf people do have lower literacy rates (at least in Canada, I am unsure if this is a global trend). >Unless the deaf are either all illiterate I'm pretty sure reading is understandable to them. 

They are not illiterate per se but they *do* speak a different language. English does not directly translate word for word into ASL. The ideas are there but not the exact words. 

>...you make it seem like they're unable to understand basic literacy. 

Somewhat correct, actually. I explained this elsewhere in the thread by saying:

Written instructions are not suitable for many Deaf people because they are not fluent in English. I've asked Deaf people to spell the word of a sign if I don't know it and very frequently they cannot. They can describe the word essentially by definition but they do not associate each sign with a written English word. In the same vein, I have had Deaf people ask me what a written word is in a news story and I tell them the sign.  Thank you! My SO saw me furiously typing away on my phone and mocked me until I explained the thread. Then he totally understood. 

Agreed. I understand and accept that many people have little to no exposure to Deaf people and especially Deaf culture but please don't make assumptions about a culture you're not familiar with.  We must form the club of the terps who stalk r/legaladvice >You're telling me being in the same room as the human being that text to speech is transcribing, a deaf person can't also see their body language? Then why bother with subtitles? Shouldn't every show on tv have an ASL button where someone in the corner pops up? 

This is a problem. It *is* difficult for Deaf people to follow certain shows because they do spend most of the time reading the closed captioning and not looking at the actual scene. In fact, I know some Deaf people who turn off the CC for sports because it's easier to just follow the game without being distracted by the CC. Same goes for weather segments and other similar things that can be followed just by watching.

>I remember my brothers HS didn't have to provide an interpreter to a deaf student, he had to pay for his own and they even didn't want to let the deaf student in.
 
You are most assuredly missing something in this story. Schools *must* provide appropriate translation services. If the students had a cochlear implant or was just hard of hearing in the first place *may* have been a defense for the school. It also depends on the age of your brother. The ADA didn't pass until 1991. Before that interpreters were not required. However, I personally know some ASL interpreters who work full time as in school interpreters where they are assigned to one student. It's full time hours, benefits and a regular schedule all of which are pretty rare in ASL interpreting jobs. 

 >I'm not trying to marginalized deaf people but it seems insane to require a business owner to provide a translator for a class that costs around $100 to take. 

My company recently purchased an old house and are currently using it as temporary office space (they will demo it and build on the site sometime in the next couple years). They had to delay using the house by weeks and invest hundreds of dollars for a wheelchair ramp that has 98% chance of never being used. The house can only fit about 10 workers and we have multiple other office sites that could be used in the small chance that someone who uses a wheelchair is hired. Sometimes companies have to spend money to make accommodations for those with disabilities. 

>Stores don't have to have a person guide a blind person around. They find their own way. 

Stores are also not expect to have interpreters on staff. No clue what your point is here.

 I'm not misunderstanding the law.  I was talking about as it applies to this situation with the interpreter not with regards to wheelchair ramps.  Ramps are a one time thing not a continuing service.

I'm not saying they shouldn't have the right to interact commercially irrespective of their disability, I'm just saying that if that's what society believes then it doesn't make sense to impose the costs of this to businesses.  In real life interpreters cost a lot of money and it isn't sustainable to force a business to spend orders of magnitudes more than what they charge for a service for the disabled.  Instead, this burden should be shared equally amongst everyone in society by making it a government provided benefit.  By doing it the way I propose then the disabled person in this case could have an interpreter whereas with the existing law he (or she) won't because the business can demonstrate that it can not afford it. When buildings are renovated they have to be accessible.  Older buildings are grandfathered in. Regardless of the analogy Deaf people often struggle with reading comprehension when reading English. Therefore, written instructions is not a suitable replacement for an ASL interpreter.  If there are several reasonable accommodations, then yes, the business can determine which they will use. However, the business owner doesn't get to unilaterally decide what accommodations are "reasonable". Even if the Deaf persons reading skills are fluent, speech to text programs are not usually very accurate and remove all inflection from the speaker. Hand writing everything as people go is slow. neither of these things give the same access as the hearing clients receive, for a lot of people, they are not reasonable. The client is probably the best person to determine what it is they need. 

If the Deaf client would accept a non interpreted one on one class and OP could afford to offer it, that may be reasonable, but I doubt that would be the case for something like weapons safety. That makes more sense to me. Thank you. > I have met deaf people who do not use ASL. As someone close with the Deaf community and fluent in ASL it is heartbreaking.

As someone who is half deaf and doesn't use ASL, sometimes it's because Deaf culture is so strongly attached to ASL and I, personally, prefer to distance myself from Deaf culture because I don't agree with certain aspects of it. There is something called CART captioning that is pretty accurate and some Deaf people prefer it to interpreting or speech to text. But it's a court reporter like device and requires a trained person to operate so it's almost as (maybe more) expensive as an interpreter. Outside of that, speech to text isn't going to cut it. It seems like their education system is failing them then. If they aren't literate they aren't as hell educated. What the hell do they teach young children then? That's the point of school. Learning a nonnative language is easier young.  To me this seems like a failure of the education system.  Literacy is an essential skill. Accommodation is important bur it does seem like something large failed for people.  Hahaha! My supervisor (also an ASL interpreter) is the same! She always asks me who I'm arguing with on here but when I explain what it's about, she gets all fired up and yells at me across the room to add her thoughts as well.  Ironically, government has had the worst track record, in my experience, at being handicap accessible. I was in a wheelchair for a bit while attending a state school and, fortunately, I could still stand for short periods of time because none of the elevators were large enough for a wheelchair. The pavement was also so rough I couldn't wheel myself between buildings. They also denied me a temporary handicap parking pass (for just the school lots).

Last year, I got called in for jury duty and asked about their assisstive listening devices (I'm half deaf) and was told they only had one, it's been broken for a long time, and it's not going to be fixed so just tough it out. Because you totally want a juror who can't hear any of what's going on. (Fortunately, they reached a deal before the trial actually started). Correct. AFAIK there is no grandfathering for something like OP's situation though. 

When the building is built they have to spend the extra money (using more square footage, grab bars, possibly lower sinks and special faucets, etc) to make it accessible. They can't charge someone with a disability a fee to use it to recoup that cost. It actually isn't up to the deaf client to determine what is reasonable either, because they have no idea what the resources of this business are either. OP can have a discussion with the customer and offer the best accommodation he can manage. I think you are treading on dangerous ground with the suggestion of a one on one class, because not allowing the customer in the regular class with accomodation is specifically prohibited by the ADA. This comment fascinates me. What parts of Deaf culture do you not agree with?  >It seems like their education system is failing them then. If they aren't literate they aren't as hell educated.

I believe young Deaf kids get a much better education compared to Deaf people over the age of 50 or 60+. At that time there were still some Deaf schools that pushed oralism in am attempt to integrate Deaf people into hearing society. Oralism focused on lip reading and speaking. For many older Deaf people their formative years were focused on learning sounds (which they could not hear) by guessing and waiting for the teacher to confirm they were making a correct a sound, letter by letter and nuance by nuance. This was much more important to the oralism movement than reading, writing and math. 

I even know an older Deaf woman who came from a somewhat wealthy family. Her family flew her multiple states away to a Deaf private school and her education is not any better than Deaf people who went to public schools for the Deaf.

TL;DR: Basically the public and private education system failed most older Deaf people. It is 100% a failure of the education system. Deaf schools for one thing aren't held to the same standard, it feels like sometimes. Yes, especially for older Deaf people education (public and private) totally failed them. I believe that Deaf children today receive a better education than the Deaf generation or 2 before them. I can't speak for the previous poster, but one of my former classmates was deaf, and he railed against the deaf culture movement too.  For him it was the refusal by some elements of the community that so adamantly refused to acknowledge being deaf as a disability to the point that they opposed medical intervention that could restore hearing.
