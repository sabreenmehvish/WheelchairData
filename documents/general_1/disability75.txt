A Beautifully Designed Walker  Now, what is the most beautifully designed wheelchair? I will be shopping for one next month.  It's gorgeous!  It's also so expensive... :( Beautifully designed things usually are.  There are so beautiful wheelchairs that I would consider "concept chairs" more than real offerings cuz they're so expensive....but a few weeks ago I saw someone get on the bus in a [Karma Explore](https://www.karmamobility.co.uk/product/i-explore-self-propel-lightweight-wheelchair/) and it looked so sleek and light I was immediately kind of jealous.  


I bought a used behemoth on Kijiji just for street festivals and marches and parades and I'm painting it pink and making pale green upholstery for it! Yeah. The Star 2 Silver isnâ€™t bad.
