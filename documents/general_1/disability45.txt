Seeking Wheelchair Users to Participate in Georgia Tech Research Study The Rehabilitation Engineering and Applied Research (REAR) Lab at Georgia Tech is looking for participants to help us with one of our ongoing studies! Our lab focuses on the research and development of technologies aimed at helping those with disabilities. For this project, we are using pressure mats to measure information about the participant's posture while they are seated on a wheelchair cushion. 

&#x200B;

Eligible participants must be: 

1. A current wheelchair user

2. Aged 18 years or older

3. Able to transfer on and off their chair independently

&#x200B;

Participating in this study involves a single 1- 2 hour visit to our lab at Georgia Tech's campus. We would have you transfer off your chair, attach the weight shift sensor underneath your cushion, place a pressure mat on top of the cushion, and have you transfer back to your chair. During the study, you may be asked to move in your chair and shift your weight at various times.

As a thank-you for participating, we will send you a $20 gift card.
