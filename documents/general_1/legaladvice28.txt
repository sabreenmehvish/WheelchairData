How do I get medical providers to obey privacy and my (non-)consent? Apparently they think my disability means they can do whatever the hell they want. Background: 

* I am in Queensland Australia. 
* I will soon be 34 years old 
* I am female
* I am disabled physically and neurologically. 
* I am completely mentally competent. (I have a masters degree in a STEM field as proof)
* Nobody has legal guardianship over me. 
* I do not yet have a medical POA for disability accessibility reasons. It’s complicated and I’m working on it.
* I live with my family because I am currently too disabled to go through the process of move out.
* My medical team thinks my health will greatly improve once I finally live alone 
* But GETTING me out on my own is too difficult right now. 
* I have never lived alone.
* My family claim to be my carers but they are not. 
* They do not provide adequate food or level of care. 
* They keep most of the house wheelchair inaccessible on purpose. 
* They do not qualify for the carer pension.
* They keep my wheelchair upstairs and they will only bring it to me if I ask nicely AND they approve of my outing. 

(This all sucks but is a question for another day. Though if anyone wants to chuck a few resources my way I’d be grateful)





Onto the current stuff:

* Ridiculously frequently I am in medical situations where my privacy and/or consent is being violated. 
* This happens every single visit, especially to a new providor
* I am treated like a child or like I am medically incompetent
* then my family is treated like the absolute experts on everything
* they are frequently allowed to consent to treatment, testing, etc FOR me
* even when I specifically say “I am aware of the risks and I am mentally competent and I do NOT consent”
* I am frequently told that I don’t NEED to consent because my family have consented FOR me.
* even happens when I explain that they are not my legal guardians and I am of sound mind and do not want them in the appointment with me.
* This even happens when my neurological problems are in remission and I appear to be "normal" (apart from the wheelchair).  
* It seems to be the wheelchair itself that triggers this weird response in doctors, nurses, and admin staff 
* advocating for myself makes it worse (some doctors get vindictive)
* I have been retaliated against for making complaints in the past. 
* If my family  mistakenly gives incorrect medical info for me, they are always believed and I am not when I try to correct the situation
* Even though they know nothing about my disease and I am the one managing it full time. 
* This can be dangerous (eg. allergy list). 
* This happens even when I bring a printed and signed list by my other doctors. 
* My main doctor believes my family is exhibiting signs of munchausens by proxy.
* she requests they not be allowed in to future medical appointments with me when she sends a referral but this is ignored every single time.
* I cannot just not bring my family to appointments because I can only leave the house when they are taking me somewhere, so they have to be there.
* I’ve been taken to hospital while saying that I do not consent just because my family lied and said I had a seizure. I didn’t.
* I was told that my family know my condition better than I do (false) and they have to take me in, consent or no.
* I was even told that since I couldn’t walk they could take me in without my consent (in case I injured my spine in a nonexistent seizure).
* I use a BLOODY WHEELCHAIR. Of COURSE I couldn’t walk for them to assess. Bloody hell.
* they still took me in without my consent after I pointed this out.
* frequently hospital staff/nurses/doctors bring in my family while I’ve said no and explained they are not my legal guardians and I am in my mid freaking 30s
* I am often then told “they still have a right to be here!!” and then they get brought in anyway. 
* if I manage to keep my family out of the appointment/hospital/whatever, I am almost universally wheeled back out to my family and then the nurse or doctor then proceeds to give them a detailed summary of the whole appointment. Diagnosis, treatment, etc.
* this happens MORE when I specifically tell them not to and that they absolutely do NOT have permission to discuss even one single thing about today’s appointment with my family.
* I’m again frequently told that they have a “right” to know.
* Even more bizarrely, sometimes random strangers get treated this way because they happened to just be NEAR me in the waiting room when my family member nipped out to the loo! So now some random strangers know my private medical info.



My main doctor says most of this is illegal because I am mentally competent and not a minor.



So my main question is NOT how to report this (it doesn’t help), but how on EARTH do I bloody well STOP it happening in the moment?  I’ve been told it breaks so many medical consent and privacy laws, but every single place does it ALL the time.  Try r/auslaw or r/auslegal for Australia-specific advice.  All I can say is that I'm sorry you're in that situation.  It sounds infuriating. If your doctor or a hospital performs treatment on you in direct contravention of your consent - even if it's something as relatively minor as "don't draw blood" "okay here's your blood draw" - then you should immediately file a complaint with the [Office of the Health Ombudsman](http://www.oho.qld.gov.au/health-consumers/what-can-i-complain-about/).

In the interim, this is as much a boundaries issue as it is a legal issue. There are no simple solutions: if you assert your boundaries, your parents may withdraw support. Legal solutions need to start with figuring out how to get you in front of doctors without your family present, let alone speaking, and that's difficult. In principle, you have a right to privacy, and can withdraw from appointments and treatment if your care providers won't protect your privacy, but most of the useful remedies for this are after the fact.

However, if your parents are restricting you from leaving the house - for example by putting your wheelchair where you can't access it, or by rolling you back into the house against your will - you should also call the police.

You've largely covered the practical advice in one of your comments: you're already looking into charity and public welfare services to end your parents' involvement in your life. The only thing I'd add to this is to look for a local legal aid society or legal charity that works with disability issues: this is a _depressingly_ common problem, although your description sounds more severe than most cases. Have you tried contacting Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia?

https://adaaustralia.com.au Is there an Australian equivalent to Adult Protective Services? r/auslegal would be a better place for this. 

But you can stop it by simply telling your family they are not to come into your doctor's visits with you. Demand they leave the exam and consultation rooms before anything begins. Demand that your doctors and other medical personnel not speak to anyone other than you about your condition. Make sure they have not placed consent to share orders in your file. At least here in the US, hospitals and other large care facilities have patient advocates/ombudsmen who you can speak to about this.

And as much as you may not want to hear it, you should look into moving into your own place. If you family really is making your life this difficult, you need to extricate yourself from that situation. I understand you may not have the financial means to do so, but it sounds like it would be best for you.  Thank you

Any new doctors office that does actually stick to the privacy laws (they're a rare diamond) my family immediately hates and wont go back there. 


I mentioned to someone below that they don't officially hide my wheelchair. They put it away because it's apparently a tripping hazard. And then just don't get it back down because their backs hurt. Everyone at once. 

They're not denying me, you see, they just simply need me to realise that their health is important too and they won't be injuring themselves because I feel the need to go out today (etc. etc.). Eyeroll.

But it means I don't have any proof, is the thing. 

And I didn't explain it well but the house itself also restricts me from leaving the house. It's REALLY inaccessible. So I need actual physical HELP from my family to exit the house (unless I want to just spend the whole time outside the house in our back garden). Their point is that I cannot impel them to assist me against their wishes and that to try to do so would be abusive of me because they have rights. So they are therefore allowed to refuse to "let" me go out, because they're not ACTUALLY refusing that, it just amounts to that in the end because they can pick and choose to help me or not. And that it's not their fault that's how things work when you're disabled and forced to rely on others.


You're right this stuff is so common - I knew a guy who had CP whose mum would confiscate his speaky box when she didn't like his choices, so he then couldn't communicate until he agreed to do what she wanted. He was late 20s.


I actually thought this kind of thing was normal until a couple of years ago until a hospital forced me to see a psychologist to cope with having a bad disease. I'll never forget the horror on her face when I described my family. Since then they've only gotten worse. Oh thanks - how do I post there? Today is my first day here and I don't know what I'm doing. Oops.



I cannot address this with my family - their behaviour gets worse if I am not a "good girl" and then I don't get to go to the doctor at all. (They're worried about me getting well enough to one day leave them, and even admitted that. Out loud. Yikes)



As for self-advocating at the doctors and hospitals, and making it clear they're not allowed to do that? I already do it as much as I can and it seems to make them worse on purpose. Like, they get really vindictive and do it 10 times worse the next time just to be spiteful. It's bizarre. 



Nurses at my main doctor's practice even do it. And I have seen the huge red notes on my file "do not discuss anything with parents EVER. Even in an emergency. Parents known to FAKE emergencies for attention. Suspected Munchausens by proxy". And all the nurses still do it. A doctor covering for my doctor while she was away still did it too!


It's like the wheelchair is a magnet for stupid



And the long-term plan is to move out.  Short term it is proving impossible.  Local disability places have declared me too disabled to live alone (lies). I am too disabled to qualify for half the services and not disabled enough to qualify for the other half.  All wheelchair accessible apartments cost more than my entire disability pension in rent alone (let alone my expensive doctor appointments, medication, and medical diet). Government housing waiting list is 3+ years, and I've been told by the women's shelter that they will deposit me back to my family because I'm too "special needs" even though my family is who I'm running from. Besides, I can't access my wheelchair without them getting it down for me and they won't unless they approve of why I need to go anywhere. And they're always home (they co-ordinate so I'm literally never left alone. I'm writing this after 2am for a reason. But that means I can't have someone come get me while they're out of the house)



And my family member is a Silk who is likely in line to be a judge soon, and has threatened to get me declared incompetent if i ever attempt to move out, using the evidence of me attempting to move out when I am so sick. Apparently it proves that I cannot make sound decisions because I'll never survive without them "caring" for me.



Whoops, I wasn't going to get into the "how the hell do I leave" stuff in this post. As a thought experiment, and pretending for the moment that someone is willing, if you called a friend to come over and give you a hand getting out of the house without your family's consent, what happens? Do they tell your friend you're not home, or that they're not welcome? Do they allow it and then give you crap about it afterwards? Something else?

I ask because it does sound like you're going to need to take more charge of your own mobility, as exhausting and as frustrating as it is, simply because your family can't be trusted. That means storing your wheelchair in your room (and possibly getting a lock for it, so that you can anchor it to furniture or similar, if you think your family will remove it from your room), recruiting people to help you come and go, and planning your trips in a fair bit of detail. It may not be _right_, but you are your own first line of defence on a lot of this stuff.

That goes hand in hand with looking for local organizations you can reach out to directly, without your family's involvement, to help. I can't speak for Queensland (I'm in the wrong former colony for that), but here it's fairly common for disability support groups to offer things like shuttle services once a week or so. Being able to literally leave your family behind when you go to the doctor may make a huge difference. The very second your family refuses to let you leave, you call the police. That is unlawful imprisonment. You are an adult, and they cannot keep you locked up. Gather any evidence you have that your family believes they can keep you under lock and key, or fears what happens if you get better, and put it somewhere they can't get to it (a friends house, or scans uploaded to a cloud service).

There have to be advocacy groups for people with your condition.  Contact them and ask them for help, or at least references for a new doctor/medical team.

Find a new doctor. One who respects your rights. 
 Nobody is allowed to ever invite anyone to the house without notifying everyone else first and getting their OK. (not just me). I just never get the OK when I do ask. 
(Yet they invite my kinda-stalker in for tea when he dropped by unannounced after I told him to leave me alone. So basically, it's weird?)

I think it would depend how sick I am on that particular day. Quite possibly turn them away. Or let them in and make me pay afterwards for embarrassing them.


But I physically still can't get out of the house even with the friend's help.  
The wheelchair accessible path is through the garage (front door is all steps) and there's not enough room to get the wheelchair past the cars and outside unless they intentionally move their cars. Which they will never do. So I can only go out inside one of their cars.
I'm worried if I explain too much more I might be identifiable, so I'll leave it there. 


I also can't easily get the wheelchair inside my room. I kinda have to get to the door and then bum shuffle the rest of the way (or hobble if it's a good legs day). It's really not ideal.  So I can't hide it away in there. All my other stuff gets manhandled too so nothing is private. 


My particular condition is extremely variable and random so all non-essential outings would have to be spontaneous and not planned in the level of detail I would need. (As it is I spend most of my time recovering from the essential appointments already)


You've got some good ideas so don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to just shoot them down or anything. My life is just stupidly complicated and annoying. Our house is THE most ridiculous set-up.


I just mostly don't have the energy for it. If I have to choose between recovering because I went to the doctor a week and a half ago and stirring up trouble by fighting to be allowed to just be a normal person for a single day damnit, I have to choose recovering as quietly as I can so I can go to the next one when I need to. It's a frustrating choice to make, that's for sure! They always have "reasons" for everything and I can't really PROVE anything. 

The wheelchair "has" to go away because of safety - it's a tripping hazard, apparently.

And then they simply can't just get it back down for me because their back hurts too much. Everyone's. All at once. And why am [I] being so cruel as to ask people to disregard their own physical limits, [I'm] such a hypocrite and should understand what with being disabled and all. Of course they'd LOVE to get it down but safety first when it comes to back pain! (Which always clears up when I want to go to the groceries instead of to see a friend or a doctor without them. But that's just back pain not a nefarious motive nope surely not.)

You get the idea. No threat is ever explicit. They are always very careful to have plausible justifications or at least grey areas so there's no evidence of anything.  


My neuro issues are often mistaken for mental illness so I'm frequently thought to be lying when discussing my family. (Seriously. One hospital's records has "compulsive liar" in there because they didn't believe me. I can't get proper treatment there anymore because they treat me like a psychopath, so I have to go somewhere else in an emergency. It's really odd)

I don't want to call the police and sound like I'm being a big baby saying "my mum and dad are being mean to me" with no actual proof, you know?


My main doctor herself does respect my rights (shes the one who puts all the notes in my file and documents it when I come in with bruises or weird injuries just in case it's from my family) . Her nurses and the other doctors and the admin staff are all infuriating though. And it happens everywhere. It's really strange. 

I used to walk everywhere before the wheelchair. It didn't happen even half as much back then. People switch their brains off sometimes when they see the chair and it's baffling. > Nobody is allowed to ever invite anyone to the house without notifying everyone else first and getting their OK.

I'm not asking that. I'm asking what happens when your friend shows up. A house rule that you ask before inviting people over has no _legal_ force, other than that if your family aren't happy with you not following their rules they don't have to house you. I realize that I'm effectively asking "what happens if you deliberately antagonize people you depend on for daily needs," and that the long term answer is probably "they stop providing those needs," but I'm much more interested in the near-term answer because it's much more relevant to the problem of getting you to appropriate help. Part of this process, however you go about it, is _going_ to involve leaving the house against your family's wishes, and likely confronting their direct opposition when you do, so I was hoping to help kickstart some problem-solving on that front.

However, now I have a much, much more immediate question: how the hell are you expected to get out if there's a fire?

The overarching pattern is, at least based on your telling, fairly clearly one where your family thrives on remaining in control of your life against your wishes. How much of their behaviour is legally interesting and how much of it is merely unwelcome and intrusive isn't something I'm an expert in, but I can tell you that no court order in the world can change their attitudes for you. It's true that your family don't formally have a duty to help you get in and out of the house, but it sounds like they're pushing the line on taking active steps to keep you in the house.  Have you had any contact with an independent advocate? The National Disability Advocacy Program page has some helpful information on your rights, options and links to an advocacy finder.

All best, OP.  Sorry I was trying to be thorough. My next bit explains what I would think would happen: they would possibly turn them away at the door and claim I'm too sick for visitors, or let them in  and then I'd pay for it later.  But either way I wouldn't be going back out with them.


Before wheelchair I did push it a bit and my family now won't let that friend that came over back in the house. To this day they still tell me how toxic she is and how I should cut her out of my life for being rude to my family. But at that time I just laughed and walked out the door with her. 


But as for a fire? I've asked that very question and I always get told "but we'd always be here to help you - you'd never be alone in the house" and "well you can always sleep on the couch [in the open plan living room] so someone would always notice you if there was an emergency". And sometimes they even say "if it were a true emergency I'm sure adrenaline would kick in and you'd be able to run like the rest of us".  I spoke to a disability advocacy group in queensland about 18 months ago. They call me every 6 months or so to tell me to keep waiting because they haven't gotten to my case yet since its just too complicated. 
They found out that my family didn't have a sneaky guardianship court order over me though, so that was helpful. 

I'll be honest, I find these things really hard since I spend a lot of my time now stuck to the bed fighting to stay conscious (and mostly losing). Neuro issues flaring up badly. So I don't have the energy I need to put into this as much as I would like. 

But I will have a look through those to figure out if they're the ones I already contacted or not and give them a go when I can. 

I swear that having a disability bad enough to keep you from working is like having a full time job anyway with all the paperwork and phone calls! > But as for a fire? I've asked that very question and I always

Not a lawyer, and definitely not an Australian lawyer, but I would suspect (or at least hope) that wouldn't fly with your local Fire Marshal (or whatever the Australian equivalent is.)

I saw above how you're restricted to writing at 2am because they monitor you, so you can't make a phone call.  But maybe you could create a dummy/anonymous email account and email the Fire Marshal?  It might also help to pretend to be a "concerned neighbor" to hopefully minimize blowback onto you.

What I'm thinking/hoping might happen is the Fire Marshall comes out and inspects the situation, and your family is forced to install a ramp and/or make other changes that will improve your mobility/ability to leave.
