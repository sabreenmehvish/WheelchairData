Service Dogs in Apartments I recently moved in to an apartment, 2nd floor, cats only. There is another apartment meant for dogs only across the street. However, a couple just moved in below us with a dog. Desk claims it is a service animal. It still barks loudly and scares my two kittens, and wakes me up. Is there anything my girlfriend and I can do? Sorry if this is poorly written I have just been woken up by a dog. I should mention, it seems, that I live in Iowa. Service animals are protected by the ADA and Fair Housing laws. As far as you're concerned, it's no different from if the other tenant had a dehumidifier or service elevator installed. *I am a bot whose sole purpose is to improve the timeliness and accuracy of responses in this subreddit.*

> I recently moved in to an apartment, 2nd floor, cats only. There is another apartment meant for dogs only across the street. However, a couple just moved in below us with a dog. Desk claims it is a service animal. It still barks loudly and scares my two kittens, and wakes me up. Is there anything my girlfriend and I can do? Sorry if this is poorly written I have just been woken up by a dog. I understand. It seems so odd that they just wouldn't live in the dog apartments. Service animals aren't pets. Those families can live pretty much where they want- the dog isn't really even considered. I do wonder about the legitimacy of this animal, though, if it's barking all day. My guess is it's an Emotional Support Animal with sketchy qualifications.  It's because she requested to live in your building. They can't offer an alternative unless there are literally no vacancies.

For example, say I own two apartment buildings on the same land and because I'm cheap, I made one wheelchair accessible ("A") and the other not ("B"). When Sally Two-Wheels comes to me and says she wants Vacancy #3 in Building B, guess what I get to do? Spend however much money it takes to make Building B and Unit #3 wheelchair accessible (that's in addition to the fines for not making it so to begin with). I do *not* get to offer her Building A instead.  Or the neighbor is deaf.  The couple does seem healthy, younger 20s,no handicap stickers, and can drive. But its impossible to say what could be. Question (not a lawyer): in Boston where I am most buildings are not handicapped accessible. If I was wheelchair-bound and wanted to live in a specific one, would they be forced to basically re-do the whole building? That seems really excessive... 

I've lived in buildings where it was hard to get around as an average-sized non-disabled person. Things like to get to laundry you have to take a 2.5' wide spiral staircase with a stair depth of 6-8". Replacing that with an elevator would be obnoxiously expensive and may require demoing several apartments to get extra space Someone next to us yelled at the couple when they heard the dog. (Too far imo.) And they responded. Maybe a good lip reader? People with epilepsy sometimes have service dogs, because the dog can sense when a seizure is going to happen. The dog then alerts the person, who can lie down/take precautions/etc. You can also get a service dog for PTSD or panic attacks, or if you have mental illness, a dog can remind you to take your medication (not joking!).

From http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm:

>Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties.

There are plenty of reasons you can have a service dog but not appear handicapped.

But /u/placebo_addicted is correct - again, from the ADA website, "Service animals are working animals, not pets." A service animal should be trained to not bark all day.

So the options are:

1. The dog is barking to alert of a medical issue
2. The dog is still being trained (there was a recent post where the outcome was that a service dog in training has the same "rights" as a full-fledged service dog)
3. It's not a service dog, it's an emotional support animal, which is NOT covered by the ADA. No, the landlord has to allow the individual to make reasonable changes. In certain cases, older buildings are grandfathered in as they stand, but (and I'm generalizing here) if someone with a mobility impairment wants to move in and they (a) are willing to pay for it and (b) it won't compromise the integrity of the building.  X-ray vision is the coolest "disability" I've ever heard of.  I have a suspicion that the apartment doesn't know the difference between a service animal and an ESA and are covering their asses by allowing it. Service dogs are trained specifically not to make any noises unless to alert for a medical emergency and even then I doubt it would be trained to full on bark loud enough to scare kittens. Yea, we foster sick kittens and they are pretty jumpy. Even our two year old cat goes full fluff. (The reason we moved into a non-dog apartment.) Sometimes my cats go full fluff for stupid reasons (like one of them nky smelling totally normal) but yeah dogs barking outside have never bothered them before. I can imagine that's a fairly large jerkish dog.
