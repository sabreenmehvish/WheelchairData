Question for those with powered mobility devices I feel like I know the answer to this but I’ll ask anyway. 

For those with electric wheelchairs and mobility “scooters”, does the VA pay to replace the batteries when they crap out? If its service connected, the VA will buy you a brand new chair faster than the batteries need replacing. But if it's just a chair/scooter you own, rather than a medical device prescribed too you, then, not likely. please flair your post if you haven't already
