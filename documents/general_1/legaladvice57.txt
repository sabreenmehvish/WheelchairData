Motorized Skateboard vs Motorized Wheelchair.... Help me out! Alright, I'm from Tucson AZ and have been riding a "Motorized Bicycle" for the past 2 years. The local laws here in Arizona are more strict than others and basically boils down to define a Motorized Bicycle as a Bicycle with an engine no greater than 48cc and cannot be operated at speeds greater than 20mph.

If you exceed that 20mph, you are now a moped and require everything a moped requires, including but not limited to; valid drivers license, insurance, registration, windshield, signals, etc. Simply going over by 1mph lands you a pretty hefty ticket and your bicycle gets impounded as a moped or motorcycle. This is even more troublesome since it's literally impossible to get it out. In order to get a vehicle out of impound (or a "moped"), you need to provide insurance and a license. Can't do that for a bicycle.

So, I kind of want to stick it to the man and have been looking at GoPeds. These are basically little foot scooters with engines strapped to them. They are legally classified here as "Motorized Skateboards" or more specifically from our revised statutes 

(http://www.azleg.gov/viewDocument/?docName=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/28/00101.htm)
"Motorized skateboard means a self-propelled device that has a motor, a deck on which a person may ride and at least two tandem wheels in contact with the ground."

Well, I found out through our local city ordinances that these are completely banned. Most cops don't even know this and people scoot around on them all the time. They hit about 40 mph and are loud as shit.

The ordinance can be found here (http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Arizona/tucson_az/partiitucsoncode/chapter20motorvehiclesandtraffic*?f=templates$fn=altmain-nf.htm$q=[field%20folio-destination-name:%2720-30%27]$x=Advanced#JD_20-30)

Now my question is, what's the legal difference between a motorized skateboard and a motorized wheelchair? The legal definition of a "Motorized wheelchair" means a self-propelled wheelchair that is used by a person for mobility.

So if I put a seat on a Motorized Skateboard, does that make it a motorized wheelchair? Am I suddenly a pedestrian, capable of zipping down sidewalks and through crosswalks at 40 mph? Am I essentially a pedestrian suddenly because I have a seat?

I know people are going to give me a bit of a hard time, tell me it's stupid or unsafe, etc, I have no intent of actually doing this, I truthfully want a way to get to and from work like I always have been on my bicycle, but have a little leeway in court if it comes to that.

 Motorized wheelchairs/scooters are legally restricted to under 7mph (or less depending on your location) >I kind of want to stick it to the man

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha good luck with that.

>Motorized skateboard means a self-propelled device that has a motor, a deck on which a person may ride and at least two tandem wheels in contact with the ground.

Does it still fit that definition? I don't see anything about whether or not it has a seat. Also, wheelchairs normally have at least four wheels. *(The definition also says they are used for mobility.)*

Do these look even remotely similar? These popped up in Tucson some 10 years ago, and the police quickly shut that down as literally 100's of them were clogging the bike paths. Tucson as you found basically made them entirely illegal city wide. 

If you want to make that trip legal and eco friendly, buy a bicycle. That's the kind of answer I was searching for, but where is that stated? By "stick it to the man", I mean I'd like to find a way to make my 22 mile trip to work in a legal, timely and semi-eco friendly way that doesn't require a drivers license, registration and insurance so that I can support my family.

I know and you know that a motorized wheelchair is assumed to be one thing and a motorized skateboard is assumed to be another. Law is not assumptions, but language. I'm asking for help with that language to see if there is something that I missed. If I reach a courtroom, I doubt a prosecutor is going to use ToysRUs definition of a scooter as a defense. The seat was hypothetical. I've worked with power chairs for years. Every state/province in NA have the same laws. Look at the tags for various chairs. They say legal in x, x, and x states" [Here's a brochure from Mesa PD](http://www.mesaaz.gov/home/showdocument?id=4594). It has similar pictures. The website is irrelevant. The prosecutor is going to use the definitions you quoted above. A motorized wheelchair is used by one person for mobility. You are not going to be able to seriously argue that you're using a GoPed with a seat because you're physically disabled.

I didn't see anything prohibiting motorized bicycles in Tucson. If you're worried about speeding, why don't you get a [speedometer](https://www.amazon.com/Sunlite-BA002BKX-Speedometer/dp/B000CSKBBS) for your bike and keep it at 15 mph or under? That's a better solution than trying to find some "creative" workaround for legally using a GoPed. If you show up in front of a judge with an argument like that, I seriously doubt you'd win. Why not just go get a 50 cc and a license and insurance? Insurance for those things are cheap. I have a 400cc and for full coverage it's only 300 bucks a year They aren't prohibited, but cops hate em. I was pulled over for literally going 1 mph over. I was riding my bike in a bad neighborhood. They called it a "high enforcement zone". Kinda sucked man. 1 mph over at 21 mph is like sneezing and gaining momentum from it. Suspended drivers license from when I was a teen from unpaid tickets. It's a pretty unrealistic amount. Call the court or DMV and ask if they'll reinstate your license if you get on a payment plan. Tell them you need it for work. There's a term the cyclist use for these situations, I forgot it, but it's funny.
