Disabled Friend Denied Motel Rooms Hello,

I have a friend who uses a wheelchair who needs to stay in a motel room for the next 2 weeks.  Every motel that he has been to in West Sacramento has denied him rooms on the basis of his disability.  They said that they can only rent him rooms specifically designed for people with disabilities.  I have never heard of such a law nor has he ever had problems with other rooms at nicer hotels like the Marriot.  He is in a serious financial situation, so retuning to that hotel is out of the question.  Anyway, isn't this a violation of the ADA?  How can they legally turn him away on the basis of his disability?  Is there a law that I am unaware of?

Thanks 

Edit:  He told me that the motels told him that it would be a liability issue if he were to stay in the rooms.  He was told to his face by one person: I don't allow wheelchairs.

He also has Spinal Muscular Atrophy - not life threatening, just means he needs help with everyday tasks. That's so much horse shit to the point of I think that there is a misunderstanding.

I travel all over the country with my wife in her chin controlled wheelchair.  We've stayed at hundreds of hotels.

It's hard to find rooms with, like roll in showers at time.  Regular ADA rooms are pretty useless to us.  In fact, they are a bigger pain than regular rooms because of the raised seats.

Never have we had anyone come close to suggesting that we HAD to be in an ADA room.  I would sincerely have pity for anyone that would suggest this to my wife, as she would rein her terror and wraith upon them.

Now... it's possible that they may only have rooms with, like stairs that it's impractical for a wheelchair to get to.  But, if he's willing to make his own way there, they need to rent him the room. Not all hotel rooms will be able to fit a wheelchair. Did every hotel cite liability issues? It wouldn't surprise me if many hotel rooms have bathroom doors or walk spaces that are too narrow for wheelchairs.

That said, if you don't want an ADA room, why is the disability coming up at all? If room accessibility is not an issue and the hotels aren't being asked to make any accommodations, then don't mention it and they won't know to discriminate. Late to this, but may be able to shed some light on what’s going on. California is one of the most ADA compliant states because under California law, any violation of the ADA is considered a civil rights violation and therefore any disabled person encountering a violation can sue for a minimum of $4,000 plus attorneys fees. (Only state where person filing complaint gets personal payout AFAIK.)

This American Life did a great piece on this years ago. Basically law of unintended consequences - because so many businesses get sued for minor infractions (estimated that businesses in CA spend $20 million each year on payouts for ADA violations) many hotels—particularly cheaper ones with smaller profit margins—will pretend not to have any rooms available for disabled customers (“all booked up!”) rather than risk having to pay min $4k for a mirror that’s too high, or other small infraction, in a handicap accessible room. It’s super messed up, and don’t have much practical advice on where to go from here (although the episode might; been a while since I’ve listened), just wanted to help explain what might be the source of the problem. Wishing your friend the best of luck!

ETA: if he was directly told that the hotels don’t accept people in wheelchairs (and not that their handicap accessible rooms are all filled already), NAL but he should look into filing a complaint—there’s money in it for him, and that’s not right.  Might want to ask in /r/talesfromthefrontdesk. Less legal experience there, but more hotel experience. This is a violation of the ADA. If their rooms are somehow inaccessible to wheelchairs, then the property is in violation of ADA standards. The ADA contains strict guidelines regarding how spaces need to be structured in order to be in compliance with their guidelines (i.e. width of door, ect) Yolo County is pretty aggressive about ADA violations.  Start by calling the Distrct Attorney. 
https://yoloda.org/contact-us/ IANAL but as a fellow person with a disability, I can attest to how HARD it is to find an accessible room. I needed a room in Flagstaff for a club trip and ended up finding exactly ONE that had an accessible room. It was overpriced, shitty, and customer service was TERRIBLE. They didn't even offer conditioner and when I inquired they suggested I use lotion in my hair.My advice is to seek out hotels/motels that were built after 1993 as that is when the ADA was passed. They also have a federal law stating how many rooms must have roll in showers, ADA tubs, and how many must be accessible in general. I will note for it to be required to have several fully accessible rooms the required number of rooms at the facility must be greater than 51. Even if your hotel had 1 room though, it would be required to be handicapped acessible. Frequently the issue is there are many more disabled people than there are spaces in the hotel. Try calling your local chains and see if they can refer you to a sister location if they do not have a room that is available or suites your friends needs. 

On the issue of legality, if they were specifically turned away from a hotel due to their disability and that hotel happens to have none or not enough rooms that are handicapped accessible based on size, it would be a violation federally and you can file an ada complaibt online. Make sure you have documentation etc to attach. There are many ways people get around the laws by making rooms partially and not completely accessible so it can be very very hard to find a room that suits an individuals needs. 
It also would be illegal if they DID have the proper number of rooms accessible, one was available, and they denied it due to any "impression" they may have about a persons disability. Same recommendation as above, report it to the ADA. 

All in all, call the chains, don't just show up. It will eliminate the likelyhood of being biased. Call and and inquire about the kind of room you need and when you need it. Then show up. If they told you a room was available and then recanted based on anything shady, report that too.  

ADA complaints take time. It may not benefit you or your friend now but in the long run, a ruling in your favor will help others avoid this. I filed one against my first university and didn't receive anything back on it until after I transferred. It resulted in parking lot renovations that help many people now. 

Best of luck. 
  IANAL-

It might not be about denying them rights, but about not having the availability. In the hotel where I used to work, we had wheelchair accessible rooms which had one queen bed instead of a king, or two queens. This was so that the wheelchair could fit between the bed and the wall. If the rooms don't have enough space to fit a wheelchair beside the bed, it's going to limit the ability of the guest to access the bed, and possibly risk harming him/herself. Some people might have argued that they would be fine getting around the room without the chair, but taking their word for it knowing that the space isn't suitable, and that in the event of an emergency the guest might not be able to evacuate appropriately would be negligent.

&#x200B; On your last line. Not at all defending them, more so wondering if they think they'll be responsible as caretakers in any way? You didn't mention it someone if traveling with him, so ignore this if that's the case please. [deleted] I thought it could be some kind of misunderstanding, but every single motel that he asked said the same thing.  It's ridiculous.  I knew this crap was illegal.  I'm so mad right now.   But they are literally seeing him in a chair.  He can't hide it. Exactly this. There was a guy in Sacramento area that went around suing a lot of businesses out of business due to ADA infractions. He later got in som trouble for it along with other things.  >then the property is in violation of ADA standards. 

That's a surprising number of hotels actually. Does that apply to all rooms or just ADA rooms? Actually this isn't accurate. It's based on the age of the facility and the types of historical alterations done to the building. If the building predates the ADA, then there's typically NO requirement for the building to have accommodations unless there's some kind of local ordinances or something in place. Typically if you make a major alteration to the building (e.g. something that typically involves moving walls or something more extensive than just redoing interior finishes), you usually have to bring that section of the building up to the current ADA/code standards.  

So in the case of hotels, if it's an old 1960s roadside motel, then no they don't have to have ADA compliant rooms, unless they did major renovation to the building (e.g. gutted out the building and altered the original floorplans). It also applies to old business and even public buildings. 
 >Maybe they are worried about having someone medically compromised staying there?

Don't care how worried they are.  Some clerk at a hotel can't say:  "Gee... you look too disabled to stay here.  Go away, and find a hotel for disabled people.  We only serve 'normal' people here." We've had one situation... in the same universe as similar.

We went to an outdoor concert, where people, like, sat on the lawn and drank wine and stuff.  There was a height limit for chairs...  And they had a section where wheelchairs "had" to go, because the wheelchair was too high.

She literally told security "fuck you", using her wheelchair mounted communicator typed out with Morse code when they told her she had to sit in the box.  Eventually, we agreed to take her out of the chair, and she would lie on the ground.

She would NOT go in that fucking box where people told her she had to park her wheelchair.

We have stories. Can you rent the room for him? Make the reservation over the phone. Unfortunately an unbelievable number of business are in violation. Some blatantly, others may just have a few things missing. But the sad truth is the case seems to be that none of the business even bother trying to comply until presented with a lawsuit from a person with disabilities, at which point the courts will force them into compliance. I believe I saw another user post a link to an article about businesses being sued for lack of compliance.

Has your friend had any luck with their search? I’m sorry they have to go through this.  Let me check the language of the law - ADA rooms (I assume you’re referring to rooms specially made for a wheelchair user/person with disabilities to access comfortably) should absolutely be in compliance. I’ll look into any specific language about other rooms, although in theory the ADA would require all rooms to be in compliance. Let’s say there is a conference about new research findings about/treatments for cerebral palsy & lots of people have traveled to attend this conference. Let’s say many of these people happen to use a wheelchair. The hotel should not only be able to accommodate 10 people out of the 300 that would like a room (just throwing around numbers here) because they only have 10 rooms in compliance with the ADA. However, I will have to look over the language of the law to see if there is a caveat for hotels/motels (I would hope not - that is inherently discriminatory). A previous commenter had already stated that anything built before 1993 (I believe) had no requirement to be up to standard. I was operating under the assumption that poster had already read that & didn’t repeat it. Apologies if that wasn’t clear - probably is best to be redundant rather than omit information.  [deleted] Good lord.

Oh he just told me that the motels were saying that it was a liability to have him in the rooms.  I'll update that to the original post. Might have to, but even so it's just the principle of the thing, you know?  This shouldn't be happening.   >Can you rent the room for him?

That's going to ping all sorts of alarm bells for the front desk in some hotels and probably won't help. They'd still have to check his ID, so they'll still see him.   > But the sad truth is the case seems to be that none of the business even bother trying to comply until presented with a lawsuit from a person with disabilities,

You're grandfathered in with a lot of protections if your business facilities predate the ADA.

But the first thing you do that hints of renovating, improving or expanding your facility, well now you gotta upgrade to the ADA standards.  

Which is one reason why some old dumpy hotels stay old and dumpy. He has Spinal Muscular Atrophy.  It isn't life threatening, he just needs assistance with things like cooking, dressing, getting into bed, etc... Edit: although I don’t see how it could be a liability, could it be fire code with the room being too small and the chair blocking things? May be far fetched but I’m just trying to think why this would be Not if OP puts both their names on there and just shows up to the front desk alone.  But by then the room will be booked. It's a bigger deal for a person to cancel a reservation that's already been made than it is for them to not make it in the first place. (If not legally, it's a bigger deal to the person.)

Can't guarantee it'll work, and if the rooms can't be accessed by a wheelchair at all then it definitely won't, but it might be worth a shot. I’m sorry if this comes across as rude, NAL, but if he needs help with getting dressed, getting into bed, etc, does he not have a caregiver with him for these nights? Couldn’t the caregiver check in with or even instead of him since they’d (presumably) also be staying in the room?  >You're grandfathered in with a lot of protections if your business facilities predate the ADA.

No such thing as grandfathering in.  If your facility was built before 1991 and complies with the 1991 standards and have made absolutely no changes after 1991, then you're good.  Same thing for 2004.  Anything built after 2004 has to comply with 2018.

If you don't comply with the standards of 1991 or 2004, then you will be facing a lawsuit.  Dumpy hotels stay dumpy because people don't know or don't want to spend money on it and the lawsuits usually settle for so low that it's worth the risk to them.  Almost every hotel and motel is being sued in my area right now, it's frightening  Ok - but who will be providing this assistance for him?  Does he have a carer who is staying with him?
or is he explaining it like the motel staff will have to do this for him?    That’s the only way I can see them using the ‘liability’ line.    Is he travelling with a caretaker or is he expecting the hotel staff to perform these duties for him? If it's the latter they'll understandably refuse, they're not trained for this and it's not their job. The only thing I can think of is that most wheelchair accessible rooms in smaller hotels are on the first floor. You can't use elevators during a fire, and the facility may not have stair chairs or other devices designed to move nonambulatory adults from higher floors. I don't think there's necessarily any real liability there (but IANAL or a Fire Marshall) but I can see someone *thinking* there is. Still, combined with some of the other stuff, I don't think an actual concern for liability is what is going on here.  Hmmm maybe.  I'll suggest that to him.  Thanks. >But by then the room will be booked. It's a bigger deal for a person to cancel a reservation that's already been made than it is for them to not make it in the first place.

As someone who manages a hotel desk: Not really. We do both all the time. You cancel reservations that have already been booked because the person is disabled?!? was about to agree. The only was it would be a bigger deal for us would be if it was a third-party res (like from Expedia or w/e) because we can't cancel it in our system. Because they're disabled? No.  But I'll let somebody know that our cabins don't actually meet ADA requirements and offer to waive the cancellation fee if it's somebody who looks like they might genuinely need the ADA accommodations.  I'll probably call around and find them a room that'll actually work for them too.

&#x200B;

We cancel reservations all the time, on the computer, over the phone, in person.  It's really not a big deal.  9/10 it's less conflict than you expect, so it's just a common, happenstance occurrence that isn't taken seriously.

&#x200B;

No ID? GTFO.

&#x200B;

Local?  Lots of places don't rent to locals. 

&#x200B;

No credit card? GTFO.  

&#x200B;

Credit doesn't authorize for damages? GTFO.  

&#x200B;

Credit card doesn't match the ID of the person?  Possibly GTFO.

&#x200B;

Didn't pay a deposit and it's 1030pm, somebody else wants a room with cash in hand-and you didn't answer or return our phone calls during the day to confirm you were coming? Canceled; GTFO. 

&#x200B;

Pain in the ass and want to extend, and I think I'll sell the room anyway?  Nope. GTFO.

&#x200B;

Hotel is overbooked, and you're the last person to arrive?  Sucks to be you!  

&#x200B;

Super high level rewards member(who has the explicit privilege of a guaranteed room, period) comes in on a sold out night?  Somebody is getting canceled.  

&#x200B;

You're an idiot and booked last weekend, but showed up this weekend?  So sorry, GTFO, no you can't have your money back for the room you didn't use last weekend.

&#x200B;

Gigantic pain in the ass that's upset we gave you exactly what you booked?  I'm delighted to give you the opportunity to look for a place that will better meet your standards, sir. GTFO.

&#x200B;

A sister property to my employer screwed up their inventory and nobody caught it for months.  \~50 room property, they sold \~55 rooms for an 8 month window.  That's not even a super unusual occurrence in hospitality. Telling somebody that they don't ACTUALLY have a room is a completely common, sometimes everyday experience for the front desk staff of a hotel. >I'll let somebody know that our cabins don't actually meet ADA requirements

Get ready for a lawsuit if this is in CA or FL OK, but we were talking about canceling it because they're disabled so none of your paragraphs of examples are relevant here. Nope and nope.  Anyway, the property is owned by a division of the federal government.  Have fun suing them!  


Next renovation they'll be brought up to spec. You said it's harder to cancel a room that was already booked; u/TheBlueSully is giving examples of how common and easy it is to cancel bookings.  No.  You said 

&#x200B;

"   
But by then the room will be booked. It's a bigger deal for a person to cancel a reservation that's already been made than it is for them to not make it in the first place. (If not legally, it's a bigger deal to the person.) 

"

&#x200B;

Which is complete and utter nonsense, and I gave examples why.

&#x200B; Identifying context is crucial to understanding. In context, I was obviously saying that canceling a reservation because someone is disabled is a bigger psychological deal than canceling the reservation of someone right in front of you and telling them it's because they're disabled. None of your examples took context into account, that's why they're moot here. Man are we ever talking right past each other
