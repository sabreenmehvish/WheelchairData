♿️SELF DEFENCE IN A WHEELCHAIR | 8 HACKS TO STAYING SAFE  For this video the actual self defence bit starts at about 8:45 into it and there is not much there, the earlier bits are just tips like stick to well lit areas.  I’m going to be honest, I got a concealed carry handgun permit. CZ Rami tucks perfectly into the side of my chair, in the same motion used to get to my wallet.

An alternative is an ABS punch-knife. They’re made of plastic, and you can slip one down by your cushion or backrest. It’s basically brass knuckles but with a knife blade that comes out between your fingers instead of a knuckle guard. It’s great for disabled people that lack dexterity, or the hand strength to prevent a traditional weapon from being taken from them.

However, the vast majority of situations don’t need a solution like this. 9 times out of 10 just give them your purse/wallet. If you don’t carry cash, you’re only out the cost of the purse/wallet and some time.

I am a pacifist and it will wreck my life to do something like that to someone else, but the one relief I’ll have is knowing that my family is safe. I won’t let someone fuck with my family.
 Thanks for posting. I personally carry a taser for non-lethal self defense.  I’ve been looking for a handy gun that would tuck into my chair. Does that one have a safety? I know NOTHING about guns, but would like to get one for self defense, and to ease my mom’s mind for when I go places alone. She always worries about how easy of a target I am in my chair.  There are a lot of different options that could fit there. Most Compact or SubCompacts would work, though a subcompact might be hard to hold if you have any dexterity issues.

Here’s a really long but super basic primer on the most important aspects: 

**Revolver vs. SemiAuto:** A revolver is an “old west wheelgun.” It has a cylinder that rotates in the middle of the gun to line up bullets with the barrel. A hammer falls on the round and it fires. A downside is that material can get caught in the cylinder or under the hammer and cause a misfire, in addition to the fact that a revolver will only hold 5-6 rounds. A semiautomatic is like the guns you see cops using on TV, where the top of the gun slides backwards to chamber the next round. 

Some people really like revolvers, but I prefer semiautomatics so that’s what I’ll be focusing on.


**Firing Mechanism:** There are two main types of semiautomatic pistols out there: striker fired and hammer fired. A striker uses an in-line “striker” that, when you pull the trigger releases and moves forward in a straight line to set off the bullet. The entirety of this mechanism is contained inside the slide of the gun, so there’s nothing visible on the outside. A Glock is the typical example of a striker fired pistol. It’s a bit more finicky, but people claim that it prevents misfires if you drop your gun, but no modern gun should fire when you drop it, regardless of firing mechanism. 

A hammer fired weapon is one that has an external hammer you can clock. The gun will automatically cock the hammer between each round (that’s where the automatic in “semi-automatic” comes from), but if for some reason it fails to, you can manually cock the hammer by hand, unlike the striker fired. The hammer fired feels like there is less that can go wrong, but the downside is if the hammer falls on something else — for example if it catches your shirt — the gun won’t fire. It’s something to consider. CZ’s ar hammer-fired.


**Material:** Next, there are two main types of material “plastic” and metal. Glocks are plastic, CZ’s are metal. The choice isn’t super important as they are both incredibly durable, but it changes the way the gun feels substantially. Plastics are much lighter and, depending on the brand, can have more recoil (I can’t speak to if the Glock compacts do this well). Metal feels like an “real gun” to me, and has weight to it. The weight absorbs some of the recoil, and, to me, that can be very important in a self-defense situation. It could be the difference between one round on target and two.


**Caliber:** This is a bit of personal choice, since I think you’ll be choosing between 9mm and .45. Either caliber is fine. My personal philosophy is that if I pull my gun, I’m shooting more than one round. 9mm has a lighter recoil, which means more rounds on target. However, once you start looking at hollow point rounds you probably only need 1 round to stop them anyway. A .45 will hold fewer rounds than a 9mm (10 vs. 15), and the rounds are more expensive. 


**Safeties:** Not all guns have a safety, but most do. Some people do not want a safety, because without one your gun is always ready to fire. In a self-defense weapon, there is something to be said for that.

There are two main types of safety: manual, and decocker. A manual safety is one like you’re probably familiar with: a tiny lever on the side of the gun. When you draw your gun, you have to *first* use your thumb to disengage the safety before you can pull the trigger. When the safety is off, the trigger pull will be light (~5lbs) and short.

A decocker on the other hand allows you to “decock” the hammer, so that it lays flat against the gun instead of being “open.” The advantage of this is that it *substantially* increases the weight of the trigger pull (to ~12lbs) and travel distance for the first round you fire. The second (and subsequent) round will set the trigger to the “light” setting, so that it takes a light weight and short distance to get every other round off.  It’s important to note that in a terrifying situation, the extra weight/travel isn’t enough to slow you down.

This is my preferred method. With a manual safety disengaged, that gun is ready to go off. Could be on a bad draw, could be because you’re pulling the trigger, but to me it feels *more* dangerous. Additionally, in your draw training you will drill disengaging the safety together, so that once the gun is pointing at someone it is ready to fire. A decocker has such a heavy/long trigger pull that it ensures you damn well mean to let that first shot loose, and weren’t just being an idiot and trying to threaten someone with your gun. I feel much safer with a decocked weapon.

There are two other types in brief: glocks can have a trigger safety, but that’s sort of just a failure point for me. It doesn’t add much protection, and it’s something that can go wrong. Next are grip safeties, which are depressed by your palm when you grab the gun. These seemed like a good idea to me, until I read stories about them not depressing or being shot in the hand/arm and not being able to squeeze to depress them. I stay away.

The reason all that was important, is because yes, I feel like the CZ Rami is one of the best concealed weapons, and it happens to be small enough that it works well in both my manual and power wheel chairs. I prefer semi-auto to revolver. The weight is enough to dampen recoil and feel solid in your hand, but not too heavy. I think a decocker is the best solution for concealed carry, because it’s an excellent balance of safety and not impeding your ability to fire, and I think 9mm is best for my use-case. The CZ 2075 Rami BD meets all of that criteria. Glock is used by police in the US, but CZ is time worn and battle tested by police and militaries the world over. It takes a lickin’ and keeps on tickin’ so to speak, in any environment this world can offer.

However, there are advantages to a manual safety weapon, especially if there are ever kids around (if there are, you *cannot* be without a safe In either case). Some people only buy glocks, and love the way the plastic feels. They feel finicky to me, but they are much less expensive than a full metal weapon. Some people feel unsafe if they aren’t carrying a .45.

Not everyone will agree with me, and that’s fine. The truth is that you can’t really go wrong if you stick with a major brand. None of that hi-point shit, but Glock, CZ, S&W, H&K, Sig Sauer, etc. will always serve you well

My advice: Start by looking up the next gun-show in your area and going. You’ll get to feel loads of different handguns, and you can decide what *feels* best to you.  Then go to a local gun range. Most places will let you rent a gun — call ahead to ask if they have what you want — so you can try a few different ones to get a feel for what you like. Then go back to the gun show and buy that gun, since you’ll likely get the best deal there. Guys at gun shops will be thrilled to talk to you about everything, and willing to explain anything you need to know. If you have the extra money, it’s nice to buy local and a shop can order you exactly what you want. 

Good luck. I’m happy to clarify or explain anything else if you need. Also, just as a bonus, most pistol shooting sports are happy to have competitors in wheelchairs!
 This is such detailed information, thank you so much! I honestly was overwhelmed trying to start researching own my own. 

The only reason I’m adamant about having a safety is that I’m a TOTAL SPAZZ, and I have dropped more things than I have held, and I don’t want to kill one of my family members or myself because of my clumsiness. 

I have three messed up fingers with limited strength in them, so I’m worried about the “cocking” mechanism (I’m sure that’s probably not the right term for that...) I’ve fired a gun once at a range that was really hard for me to grip the top of to get the round in the chamber. 

I live in a city on the top 10 murder list, so I mostly just need it for peace of mind and to scare off potential carjackers! 

Edited to add: I’m sure the gun shows around me are huge and have tons of options, being in the Deep South!  I would probably suggest a revolver, then. Every semi-automatic is going to require you to grip the top like that and pull it back (“rack the slide”) to chamber a round, but a double-action revolver only requires you to pull the trigger. Of course, you can rack the slide with either hand if one is easier for you than the other. It’s not like you’ll be doing it often outside of the range. Actually, with a semi automatic you can rack the slide back with the gun completely empty, and the slide-lock will engage (which holds the slide back). You can then put a clip in the base, and slide a single bullet into the chamber. Then you just have to push the button to release the slide, and it will pull the bullet in for you. A safe way to load with dexterity issues, since you barely have to handle the weapon once a round is ready to be chambered.

The catch with the revolver is that modern revolvers are made without safeties, instead relying on the DA/SA method similar to a decocker weapon. 

The CZ 2075 Rami is actually drop-safe, meaning that it is virtually guaranteed not to discharge if it is dropped, as there are three separate safety features that would have to all fail simultaneously during the drop in order for it to discharge. You can ready some more about that [here](https://thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=576500). It would still have the issue with racking the slide, though.

The fact is that modern self-defense firearms have so many safety measures in place, a manual/lever safety is becoming a relic. Of course, I would suggest doing your own research rather than taking my word for it. You would want to be completely comfortable with the gun you’re buying and carrying, so if a manual safety is a permanent sticking point for you, that’s fine. You just may have some difficulty finding the right one, so research will be important.

Edit: “scare off potential carjackers!” You’re better off just giving them the car. You never know what they have in their pocket, or what the friend you can’t see might be holding. If you draw a weapon, you need to be committed to murdering the person you’re drawing on, and not hesitate.
