Theme parks and wheelchairs? I have HSD, and lately, because of it I've had a lot of pain in my legs. My family is planning a trip to a theme park, and of course I do want to go. Now usually with a lot of pausing and sitting down enough, I can manage zoo's and theme parks and stuff. So my sister got the idea that we could get a wheelchair. Now, in theory, this would work just fine as I wouldn't have to walk and my legs wouldn't hurt. But there comes my anxiety, doubting everything, and now I'm not sure to go through with it.

So, what are your experiences with wheelchairs in theme parks? Is it even legal to go with one when you technically can walk? Do I need to like, show my diagnosis or anything? Definitely go for it! It's legal - many people in medically prescribed wheelchairs can walk to some extent. Theme parks are great for wheelchairs, in my experience. Some will even let you skip some queues - if the queuing area is tight, they bring wheelchairs straight in through the exit and you get on first.  A lot of people who can walk but find it difficult/draining/painful enough to make the day harder do use wheelchairs for days out. There are no laws or rules about it and you really shouldn’t feel bad because it’s not like you’re an able bodied person using a chair just to get an advantage like skipping ques. Aids like wheelchairs are about quality of life not just a last resort and if that’s the way to enable you to get as much enjoyment out of the day as the rest of your family with being held back by your disability then it’s absolutely a valid choice. 

You will probably find you get some funny looks by some other members of the public if they see you getting out of the chair to stand or walk a short distance (say onto a ride or something) but that’s just because many people are sadly uneducated about disabilities and don’t understand how disabilities that effect mobility without completely paralysingly your legs work. Don’t let their ignorance effect you. I don’t know any statistics on it but I would say a pretty high proportion of wheelchair users can technically stand and/or walk to an extent but are enabled to access many areas of life (anything from any trip outside their house to only longer excursions like you) that they would otherwise not be able to do or struggle a great deal with if they didn’t have the option of a wheelchair. It’s totally 100% valid to use whatever tools help you to live your life to the fullest extent of your capabilities and nobody has the right to gatekeep it. I don’t think they’re going to ask for proof or anything if you show up in a wheel chair. Tons of people (most people, maybe) who use a wheel chair can do some walking so I wouldn’t feel bad or anything. I went to Disney World when in ~2002 in a wheel chair and it was pretty cool actually. Everyone was very nice I dont know what country you are in, but what ever you do don't go to Chessinton in the UK. "wheelsnoheels" on youtube did a vid on it highlighting how bad it is for wheelchair users.

In my experience, you need to go to guest services , and show some form of identification that shows you have a disability, such as a letter from your doctor, or a parking badge,  or benefit award letter. Then they will ask you a few questions about how far you can walk (incase the ride breaks down.)  and then give you some sort of pass. I hope this helps.  I've visited many parks in a wheelchair and it's always been fine. Some places ask you to get a pass so they can give you a return time at peak times.

 You should have zero fear.
It's easy.  I went to Fiesta Texas in San Antonio in 2011 and rented one of their motor chairs.  Made the whole visit possible for me. Without it, I probably would have only been able to do an hour in the park. With it, I was able to stay till late in the evening.  They had different entrances for people in wheelchairs and scooters, which helped a lot. I didn’t ride many rides, but it helped with the ones I was able to do and with the general enjoyment of the park itself. Having this option made my visit wonderful instead of stressful.  Don’t worry about what others might think, only about what is best for you.   Most parks in the US don’t require anything from you. That’s only if you want to get in a special handicap line for the rides.  I've used wheelchairs at theme parks both my own and borrowed/rented from the park themselves. Never been an issue. In the US it's illegal to ask. Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_Drive?wprov=sfti1
