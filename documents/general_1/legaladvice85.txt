[NJ] What would be the charges for assaulting a person in a wheelchair ? In a hypothetical situation , what would be the charges for assaulting someone reliant on a wheelchair who has a physical disability ? Would this automatically be upgraded to a felony since the person is defenseless ? Can the wheelchair bound person defend themselves by hitting the attacker with the power chair?

Please give NC law too.  I got punched in the stomach by a dude in a wheelchair because I accidentally pushed him away from the bar. Bought him a drink and called it a day. I've met many wheelchair-bound people who are far from defenseless.

The criminal charges would be identical to assaulting anyone else. Not necessarily. NC law has a specific statute for assaulting handicapped people. 

ยง 14-32.1.  Assaults on handicapped persons; punishments.
(a)        For purposes of this section, a "handicapped person" is a person who has:
(1)        A physical or mental disability, such as decreased use of arms or legs, blindness, deafness, mental retardation or mental illness; or
(2)        Infirmity
which would substantially impair that person's ability to defend himself.
(b)        through (d) Repealed by Session Laws 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), c. 767, s. 31, effective October 1, 1994.
(e)        Unless his conduct is covered under some other provision of law providing greater punishment, any person who commits any aggravated assault or assault and battery on a handicapped person is guilty of a Class F felony. A person commits an aggravated assault or assault and battery upon a handicapped person if, in the course of the assault or assault and battery, that person:
(1)        Uses a deadly weapon or other means of force likely to inflict serious injury or serious damage to a handicapped person; or
(2)        Inflicts serious injury or serious damage to a handicapped person; or
(3)        Intends to kill a handicapped person.
(f)        Any person who commits a simple assault or battery upon a handicapped person is guilty of a Class A1 misdemeanor. (1981, c. 780, s. 1; 1993, c. 539, ss. 15, 1139; 1994, Ex. Sess., c. 24, s. 14(c); 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), c. 767, s. 31; 2006-179, s. 1.) Didn't even notice the NC at the bottom.
