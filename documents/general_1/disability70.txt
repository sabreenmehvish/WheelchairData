My Scoliosis story  This is my Scoliosis story. Scoliosis is a curve of the spine.  I was born with it. I wore a corset brace for a while, when I was at school. After a while I didn't need to wear it anymore. Years a go, a doctor said it would be too dangerous for me to have surgery so I didn't have it. I am short in stature for my age because of Scoliosis. I can walk but when I go out I use a wheelchair (one that someone pushes me in) because I get tired walking. Every 4 or 8 months, (depends if my results are good) I have lung function appointments at a hospital. My results were good at my appointment in April, so my next appointment is in December. r/https://www.instagram.com/p/BknSJfDA3zi/?taken-by=sarahsscoliosisinsta

Best wishes on your journey!
