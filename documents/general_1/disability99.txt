I'm so happy I found your post, I've been building a workout routine through trial and error for the past few years but I have no one to talk to who shares the limitations brought on by O.I and I haven't been getting very far. Honestly I can't even comprehend how you got this far?!!

What's your routine and how do you deal with the huge setbacks from fractures? And how do you avoid breaking or hurting yourself lifting? Hey ! thanks for the comment, i really appreciate it.

My routine is: Be smart, be caution, know what to train, understand yourself. Work on your weakpoints first. I prevented fractures (still got injured while working out but nowadays, i'm more caution and know what to do/how to do). Improving weak-points will lead to less-injury-prone *makes you stronger too* Go from there, just work out all weak points, build it up as you go on. Eat healthy, be consistent = #key [#delicatenutrition](https://www.delicatenutrition.com/)
