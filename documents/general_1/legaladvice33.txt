Wheelchair stuck in building due to snow Wondering if I have any legal grounds to go after my landlord of my apartment complex. When I moved in there was someone here during normal business hours that would shovel snow. They left the company and were never replaced. Over the last 3 years I have been late to work or missed Work solely because the ramp to get out of the building is just too deep from snow. This has caused me to reach out for help from friends in the building to help by walking my dog, or shoveling the ramp (I usually get them some beer for their troubles). Work has a new attendance policy that is stricter and I am being pinched by Work. I tried to research the topic for the state (OH), and local laws but could use some help. Thanks Ohio does not have mandatory snow removal laws. Your local jurisdiction may, or your lease may have some wording. What county and city/township are you in? Does your lease say the landlord is responsible for snow removal? If so, have you asked them about this?

Cuyahoga, and city of Cleveland This has been a conversation with both the old management company and the new. No one is ever in the office so I can never seem to get my hands on the full lease.

If the LL removed some snow, you could say that he needs to remove the snow from the ramp as well. But if he doesn't remove any, its tough to argue that they are being discriminated against.

I think the best bet here is to:

1. Ask the landlord for an accommodation to remove the snow
2. Make a complaint to the city that the LL is not removing the snow (while this may bite OP in the ass as he is responsible too, I can't see them citing a handicapped person for not)
3. Call the fire department, because not being able to exit the building is definitely a fire hazard

No good, easy, foolproof options here unfortunately  CCO 507.13 is the ordnance you're looking for. It says:

>Every owner, occupant or person having charge of any tenement, building, lot or land fronting on any
avenue, street, alley or other public highway of the City, shall clear the whole sidewalk in front of the
tenement, building, lot or land, of snow and ice, before 9:00 a.m. of each day;

This gives equal responsibility to you and your landlord. Obviously you cannot physically do it yourself, but if there is no wording in your lease you may need to hire someone yourself to do it. 

Have you brought this up to your landlord? The fact that they did it in the past may help you convince them that they should continue to do so.  Getting your lease is key. Another poster says your area doesn't have laws requiring your landlord to remove snow, but your lease might.  I posted a link to a court case describing their requirement under the ADA to remove snow in a timely manner despite Ohio not having laws about removing snow in general. Whether they're being discriminated against or not the landlord still has to remove the snow. IANAL just reading ADA stuff. Interested just because I too am in a wheelchair (short term, couple months).
