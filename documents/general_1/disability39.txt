My neighbor's in a wheelchair, and we'd love to surprise her by having her over. The problem is that every entrance to our home involves a couple of steps, and we're not capable of lifting her past those steps. Could anyone here recommend an affordable, adjustable ramp we could get to have her over for Game of Thrones?

 In general, a ramp should not have a steeper grade than 1/12.  So if you have two 8" steps, then you need a ramp that is 16' long.

Hope that helps? If you're not in a position to purchase a ramp, some places might rent them. Have you asked her if she already has anything like that already? You'd be surprised at what we hold on to! In a pinch, I've used a piece of plywood and / or 2x4 boards That totally helps! Thanks. Honestly you could get away with something less than that. I've used a 7 foot folding aluminum ramp for stairs at least that tall. And she may have her own ramp, just ask her. I have one in my van all the time.  What kind of ramp you're able to fit in your van - can you use it for more than 2 stairs? Any recommendations appreciated! I have a 7 foot folding aluminum ramp like this: https://www.discountramps.com/scooter_ramp/p/WCMF/ And yes, I've used it for 3 or 4 stairs but 4 is getting steep. Obviously the steeper it is the more assistance the chair user might need.
