"Police snatched a phone from a disabled wheelchair-bound veteran who was recording them in front of a VA hospital in Tennessee..."  I tend to side with veterans but this just looks like the guy wants nothing more than to cause trouble.  How much is a muzzle? 10 bucks?  Why not just get one?  I have seen plenty of service dogs around.  I know they are well trained and very normalized to humans (ie they don't bite or attack).  But people get them because dogs make some people nervous.    I can't speak to the guy's previous interactions with the cops but he goes off a little too fast.  What had the cop done up to that point? Asked if it was male or female. And all this was premeditated with the camera and his instant to yelling is not in line with the PTSD I have experienced or had others tell me about.  Not saying he doesn't have it but claiming a hot word like PTSD paints you ill if it used in the wrong context.  I hope the guy gets help but I don't think this video helps his cause. Sharp V. Boston. Memorize it, it was the Supreme Court ruling which says under the First Amendment it is legal to record police officers going about their duties.  You may be correct I really do not know, but I do know that it is against federal law to video on the anywhere on the property of a VA facility without permission. Yeah the VA being Federal property has it's own wankey laws. This is a valid point, just like how that ruling wouldn't matter on base.
