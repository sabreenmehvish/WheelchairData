[Michigan] Disabled brother and mother denied disablity entrance/exit at college and degraded Hi. Sorry for spelling mistakes, i just spent the day calming my brother down, it's really hard as i am the provider for my mother, myself, and my disabled brother. I grew up with him, and he was crying and talking about wanting to kill himself all day. It's really hard, as he's completely disabled and it hurts my heart. He's asleep now and i'm done crying myself.  


Basically, my local college has a wheelchair accessible entrance/exit, where people with disability can catch the Disability Bus / Get dropped off or Picked up. My mom wears a scarf, this important, because the security for some reason always stops my poor old mother and gives her shit constantly. My mom is a frugal little old lady that's been through a lot of shit and doesn't need this, but she always try her best to communicate with her poor English skills.

&#x200B;

Anyways, The security guard denied my mother entrance, although the Van is clearly marked Wheelchair Accessible (It's a very expensive van that i saved up for a long time to get). The same security officer saw my mom drop off my brother earlier, but for some reason he would not let her in and my brother was on the other side of the barrier. He was blocking the enterence with his car. My brother was on the sidewalk, and the sidewalk is a couple inches high, making it impossible to get down, especially that he's on a 400LB electric wheelchair. Meaning my brother can't get off the sidewalk to cross the parking lot (With moving cars) to get to my mother. She needs to park in the designated disability parking and lower the ramp onto the sidewalk. My mother pleaded with the man as my brother asked him to please move the car as he clearly needs my mother to get into the specifically designated wheelchair pickup/drop off area. The officer then proceeded to harass my mother and brother, and used very vulgar language and yelled at them infront of the whole school. Passerbys confronted the security officer and told him my brother is very clearly disabled and can't leave the school. The officer then started threatening action against my mother and brother and my mom told him that he didn't need to be doing this and that all he needs to do is let her in to pick up her son. The rent-a-cop then said pretty rude things and mocked my brother for being disabled with things like "That's his own problem" (Directed at my brother) and "You brought this on yourself when you had him" (Towards my mother). My brother and mother then had to wait for the entire parking lot to clear, then go back into the school, go to the other side, find someone to hold the doors open for him, then leave, and drive on the side walk for a long time until he could find a bike ramp to get off the sidewalk onto the road.

My mother came home crying and my brother shortly after. My mother has spent the entire day in her room. Mind you my mother has attempted to commit suicide before, we haven't exactly had the best life with our dad leaving us and having to care for my disabled brother with her having to tend to his day to day needs whilst i work. My brother has also attempted suicide, and today we had to hold him down and get a knife out of his hand as he was trying to slit his own wrist. We all talked about it and hugged and he's okay now, he's in his bed and i made him laugh a bit. I made my mom laugh and took her out a bit and got her some nice flowers and stuff from the store. To be honest i've just been done crying and my suicidal thoughts have past just now and i was able to bring myself to type this out.

Multiple times have called the schools accessibility counselor and complained that:The ramp is too steep. My brother has fallen face first onto the concrete MULTIPLE times within the past 3 Years. My brother has scraped his hands and skinned his elbows on the ramp because it's too narrow and too steep.Today was a first. Never have i seen such cruelty towards a person with disability. I thought it was just a thing in the movies, but this person was legitimate angry at my brother for being disabled and enjoyed taunting him and making his life worst and showed no remorse. I've made a complaint against the security/rent-a-cop to the school right after the incident but they were basically non-caring and sounded like they weren't going to do anything.

Now my question is, what can i do? I want to make this right. My brother is probably not going to be going back to college, and it's the only thing that is keeping him happy. He told me he felt embarrassed and didn't want to go back during our talks today, i wanted to take him and go to the deans office. My mother is just a wreck. She already hates her life enough, now it's even more and i fear she might actually kill herself. I wont be sleeping tonight and i keep opening the doors and checking if they're okay, i have all the keys and knives next to me and no pills are out of my sight. I'm sure there are multiple  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) violations, and i'm pretty sure there's some law out there that prevents this kind of harsh mis-treatment. It was very discriminatory and they outright denied my brother use of the wheelchair accessible portion of the building. What can i do? Who can i talk to? How do i do it?

Thank you.

Update: This has blown up so much, i just was able to see this and all the love and support from reddit is amazing. I love you all and i hope everyone is having an amazing day, thank you for brightening up mine. I will post a update later tonight as i'm reading through the replies and deciding best course of action, thank you all.  


Update: Ive emailed my states ADA office, as well as forwarded a copy of the complaint to the:  
Dean  
Student Disability Support  
Campus Disability Support  
Accessibility Support  
Assistant Dean  
Vice President

and multiple other high ranking school members.  


I will be calling CoPower tomorrow, as they're closed now.  You should contact an ADA/disability rights attorney. I don’t think you will have any trouble at all finding one to take you on contingency (that means they are paid from the settlement and not before) with the set of facts you describe. Mention to them any other students you know of who have experienced discrimination. The ramp grade thing should be easy to deal with since there is an ADA Standard for it and there have been actual injures, and the security behavior you described is outrageous and clearly illegal.  I'm not a lawyer, but I do work in higher education.  The Dean of  whatever-the-fuck  is not as powerful a person as everyone thinks.  If you have had no luck with similar com0laints send a message to everyone in the provost's office.  If there are any offices with "compliance" in their names message them, too.  If that doesn't stir up a hornets nest fast escalate to the university President and vice presidents.  Unless you're at an ivy league, these people will be accessible and most likely responsive, and happy to fire a contractor who is making them look bad or committing crimes under their authority.

Deans are middle managers in most schools First, you sound like an incredible, kind person and the world should be so lucky if more were like you. 

I am so sorry this happened. Contact the dean office and have your mother write a letter explaining what happened for you to translate and send it to them and the security and parking office. Contact the disability services at the school as well. 

Give these folks a call too. http://www.copower.org 

I am not convinced that it is attorney time just yet as MI does not appear to have a private right of action for a violation, but I could be wrong. In any case, these are MI disability advocacy services and can connect you with whatever resources you need, including attorneys if need be.

In the meantime, please keep doing you. I am so impressed by your nature of wanting to care for your family. I hope you are also caring for yourself as well. 

Don't be afraid to come back and ask us any further questions you have. But I think contacting the dean, disability services at school, and MI alliance for disabled shoukd be a very good start.  As someone who works in higher ed, this is the kind of incident that makes university admins really nervous. The ADA is ramping up actions against schools over things such as missing closed captioning on educational videos and many have a very high awareness of avoiding ADA issues.

However, if you are to get anywhere with this, you'll need good witnesses. Otherwise, it quickly becomes a he-said / she-said thing, because the security guard will never admit it, of course.

Try hanging around the building at the same day/time as the incident and see if your mom/brother recognize anyone so you can get their contact info.

Then, as others have advised, try going through the university disability office with a complaint while also complaining to the police/campus security unit.

Finally, your brother may have to go through the Student Affairs office or whatever the name is at the university to file a formal complaint there. However, the student handbook will spell out exactly how and where to complain.

one other thing, if any campus buses (if you have those) pass by the area in question and happened to do so during the incident, they may have camera footage of the road and part of the altercation. It likely won't be needed, but can help identify the security officer and/or vehicle.

Not a lawyer. If you are having trouble finding a lawyer to take your case, disability advocacy groups should be able to help point you in the right direction (re lawyers). Call the schools disability students group and see what they offer. Also is there a Dean for disabled students



Call the local city’s non-emergency line and ask if they can assist next time 


More generally, is your brother and mother in therpay or on anti-depressants for being suicidal


There is also the suicide prevention hotline- you and your family can call them, please do.  Use this link to get in contact with an ADA advocate.  https://adata.org/find-your-region# 

I am so sorry your brother was treated like that, I myself am a wheelchair user and this is absolutely appalling.  You and your brother are in my thoughts, I am so sorry this happened.   I am not a lawyer.  When you say Your mother wears a scarf do you mean she wears a scarf around her neck for warmth or she wears a scarf for religious purposes? If she wears a scarf for religious purposes perhaps the ACLU would be interested in helping? Asking them isn't going to hurt anything they may not be able to help but they may be able.

 In my non-lawyer personal I'm just a regular American pov I am completely infuriated that your mother and your brother were treated so poorly. I just want to come and wrap your entire family in a hug and let them know that everything will be alright. 

Please don't think everyone feels this way about people with disabilities this is complete and utter bullshit and I wish I could come and help you. This is not how regular Americans think or act. People that act in the way of this guard did do not represent the way most people feel about those who are different than we are. Do you know if this rent-a-cop was from campus security, or which department he was from? You could file a complaint with his superiors (in addition to everything that’s already been suggested).  This is also ripe for false imprIsonment charges. I have seen them brought for far less. I would make a police report. OP, talk to your college's Office of Students with Disabilities about all the incidents that have affected your brother (if you haven't already--I'm assuming you're already affiliated with this office and if you aren't, you should be, that's what it's there for) and file an official complaint with the Public Safety office (or whatever the security Dept is called) regarding that security officer. Getting third parties like an attorney and an ADA advocated involved are great, but people underestimate how important college legislature is and all of this needs to go on record so it never happens again. [removed] [Please consider filing an ADA complaint with the Department of Justice.](https://www.ada.gov/fact_on_complaint.htm) Get multiple small dash cams that will record everything in high quality video and audio from the van and your brother's wheelchair. Test it all to be sure it works well in advance.  Take your time to research the equipment to get exactly what you need.  Dash cams on the vehicle can help you a lot with any traffic incidents anyways. OP, at my universities, the cops were/are actual police. If this is the case at your brother’s school, their chief would probably like to know about this. NAL, but a faculty member in higher education.  While an academic dean might not be helpful, most places have a position something like dean or Vice President of Student Affairs - they’re the person who oversees offices like disability services, the registrar, financial aid, enrollment, etc.  They will be the administrator you’ll want.  

Additionally, you may want to see if the college has some sort of office focused on student retention, and especially student counseling.  Your brother should not have had to have gone through this, and the college should have resources to help him deal with the emotional aftermath of it.  While they may not be able to help your mom directly, they may be able to connect you with resources in your community that can help her (and you).  

Third, document all conversations you have with college administration.  College administration will have no problem throwing the security contractor to the wolves, but when it comes to doing things that involves serious money (like construction), they can make promises they have no intention of following up in and they can and will cover up issues.  If you need a lawyer in the future, you’ll want that documentation. 

One last thing: you and your family are needed in this world.  Please reach out to the NAMI hotline if you need help at all. If this is a marked disability spot, CALL THE COPS. This is illegal. Yes, go through all these other channels, but you don't need to go through all this to potentially get a result in the future. The ADA is federal law, this issue is specifically addressed, and there's a built-in  solution to someone breaking the law...

CALL THE COPS I’m sorry to hear that this happened to you and your family. I’m disabled because of young onset Parkinson’s disease, and I’ve read up a lot on the legality of just this type of situation. I refuse to become a victim of harassment, bullying, or discrimination, so I’ve learned how to fight back. 

You’re doing the right thing. You should also contact your state attorney general and file a complaint and ask them to investigate. If this happens again, call the police and press charges against the security guard. His behavior is harassment, and his words elevate this to a hate crime. Be sure there are witnesses and/or video of the altercation. 

Good luck to you all. I hope your brother decides to continue school and not let this animal win.   [removed] In today's age SOMEONE was recording that happen, find it and then you have solid proof to win. In addition to your list, call and email the school’s compliance officer. It’s most likely going to be an attorney who works to mitigate risk to the university. They do not want the federal Office of Civil Rights to come knocking. 

I would also send a copy of whatever letter you send to compliance to the school’s president and their board of directors. 

This is absolutely reprehensible and I hope the security guard is fired.  The school should have a person in charge of ADA issues who can straighten things out. I know my school has an ADA officer, and that is her whole job. Whenever there were issues, she stepped in. Make sure the school’s ADA Compliance Officer knows what is going on.  [removed] [removed] IANAL but I have multiple disabilities and I faced discrimination in college - I had to file a complaint against a professor & a department of the university. I filed a complaint with the Affirmative Action Officer and the state Office of Civil Rights. Put up some flyers( But as the mod said not social media ). And give them to the people on the college with quotes of the guards words he said to your brother. If the college do nothing show the people there what piece of garbage is working there.

And you also give your brother and family a little power back. The most miserable feeling in this situation is to feel like a victim. Change that and do something.

With mails and nice words it isnt done. Because if this people hear it first time they would have done something if they arent piece of shit. They did nothing so, tell it everybody who is on the college and a few people would do something and the others will maybe follow. But as the mod said not social media. go next to the college and give flyers to the students, and only with quotes or another short message. That should be legal (i do not live in usa, in my country it is ful legal to give flyers out with messages or "quotes etc) Well it's a bit late now but if it ever happens again, stop talking to the stupid ass security guard, pick up the phone and call the real police and let them know that you need an officer on scene ASAP to deal with this as your brother is being denied a reasonable accomodations and is being falsely imprisoned (being prevented from leaving).

Document the hell out of this every time and be filing complaints with the school administration every single time. Next time try to ask witnesses if they would be willing to help you with testimony or a written statement and if you could please have them contact you--not everyone will be willing which is okay but some might and if you end up having to sue the school /file an ADA or accomodation (what's the school specific title number thing? Heh) or something they could come in handy. I have a son with a hidden disability (autism) and we get treated poorly in public often. Most times it's minor and not worth the fight. This in my opinion, is something worth fighting. Your family is very lucky too have you and I am glad you have each other. Life is challenging enough for families like ours and these encounters are not needed. Hang in there and take care of yourself in order to continue helping them.  Thank you. I will do that in 12 hours (2PM. as it's 2AM now). Seconded, I happened into security management as a second profession an I can tell you this man is absolutely operating beyond his mandate and out of personal prejudices. I’d fire him, FWIW. Every university I've attended or worked at, the Deans are near demi-gods of power, able to cut through whatever "policy" or red tape that exists.  

They literally point and people can graduate who didn't have the requirements.  They let people study abroad their final year, for the whole year.  They change grades retroactively and alter transcripts.  

A high-on-his-horse security guard will be looking for work if the Dean of Students hears what is going on. That or donate to the football team. Donor's beat everything. Thank you!  


I will be calling them, i've already emailed entire board and ADA. I will continue to provide updates, thank you so much!  There was 2 buses. I will reach out with emails tonight. Thank you so much.  [removed] Thank you, i will email them right now.  In another post OP mentions they are middle eastern so it seems reasonable to assume the scarf is for religious purposes. I have to wonder if there’s isn’t some racism tied in with the ableism they experienced.  Just so you know, this is not at all something the ACLU would get involved with, even if the acts of the guard were prompted by the mother wearing religious headwear. 

The ACLU fights for people's civil liberties against a policy, or lack thereof, that suppresses people's basic rights. While there is no dispute the brother was discriminated against by this guard, it is almost certainly not the policy of the school for employees to act as he did, or to prohibit disabled people from using disabled parking. 


This could be a matter for an attorney, perhaps, but only if the matter is not rectified- that is, ascertain the brother is able to safely get from his car to classroom and back again. The ACLU gets involved with things like  a school preaching a particular religion or against another, but here it is almost assuredly a matter of one asshole being his asshole self. This is outside the scope of what the ACLU deals with. A local attorney who practices disability law would more than suffice if need be.  He was campus security.  Good point. Others maybe thought of it but it didn’t cross my mind until reading your post. I will email them tonight, many people suggested this.

Ask them to write a letter. Direct them to address it to the president, the general counsel, and the director of the Counseling Center. There are community outreach program for ADA issues.  The one I worked for I helped get slumlords to make their buildings compliant all day.    Dean's have high authority only on academic matters.  They are not normally in chain of command for external contracts or contractors.

If you're a student, they're demigods.  If youre faculty theyre managers.  If you're literally anyone else they don't matter at all. [removed] Racism, and once he was called out, he doubled down in an effort to intimidate the mom and son out of reporting him. I wondered about that I suppose they can't really help every person individually. Thank you for the education You could talk to the head of security, they are likely to take it seriously. They should have an office you can go to. Sorry for the late reply everyone, i couldn't get to it until 3:30 and just got home. 30 Minutes before this office closed. I will write up an update on the matter tonight.  The Dean of Students would certainly have authority over any accessibility-related issues and even if they do not directly oversee the security contract, they would have sway with whoever does. The Provost is a fine place to go since they are basically #2 next to the university President, but their power is much more limited when your concern is outside of the academic realm.

Additionally, the Dean of Students and/or the Vice President of Student Affairs generally report directly to the President and can make them aware of the situation. If that doesn't solve things, contact the President's Office directly. They do larger policy work, which helps many more people in the end. >even if they do not directly oversee the security contract, they would have sway with whoever does.

Or, in the grand tradition of middle-managers, they may see that this is somebody else's problem and see themselves clear of it.

I've witnessed both of these chains of events play out in real life. It makes sense. I only suggested it in the first place because it seemed like it was a school official preventing him from access to education and I wasn't sure if that would translate to their only restricting this one person or guess it would apply to all disabled people as a whole in that area
