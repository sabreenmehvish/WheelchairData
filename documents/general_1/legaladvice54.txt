GA My Principal asked me to get out of my wheelchair and crawl up the stands in front of my entire graduating class. This happened in Georgia. This happened to me 4 years ago when I was seventeen. I did not do anything at the time, and I likely wonâ€™t now, but I am curious if legally they did anything wrong. Sorry if this is kind of long but there are a lot of details. Background info: I was in a wheelchair and on hospital homebound for the entirety of my junior and senior years of high school. Hospital Homebound was a program my school district had for kids who were not allowed in school because of medical reasons. I had 5 ankle surgeries during this time including a complete re-building of my ankle. Long story short, after breaking my ankle the doctors discovered that I was born without the center bone in my ankle. The first surgery did not work and I had to have my ankle replaced at 17. That is not the problem though. During this time my doctor did not want me in school because if someone bumped my ankle it could cause me to have to have the surgery done again. 
This is the part that leads me to the actual legal question. The week of graduation my doctor cleared me to go to the graduation events as long as I was extremely careful. My parents contacted the school and told them this, and the school said they would help keep my ankle safe. I arrived at the school for graduation pictures in my wheelchair. They were supposed to be taken in the football stands. I get there and I am in a dress and my graduation gown. My principal comes up to me and tells me to get out of my wheelchair and crawl up the stands in front my entire graduating class. I did not feel comfortable with this, and I told him that. He insisted, and since I was a shy 17 year old I did what he told me to do. I tried to keep my ankle in the air while doing this to keep it safe but it was almost impossible to do that. I felt completely humiliated and afraid that I had hurt my ankle. It turned out that that my ankle was fine but I still feel like what they did was wrong. 
My question is, was my principal in the right asking me to get out of my wheelchair and crawl up the stands in front my entire graduating class. Even after my doctor had pulled me from school to keep my ankle safe?


Edit: I just wanted to add that going to board of education is pointless because the principals uncle is the head of the board. No, he was obviously not right.  Temporary disabilities are covered under the 2008 amendments to the ADA act and they must provide and allow for you to use wheelchair accessible facilities.  Do you have any video or pictures? Probably to late to do anything about it now.

You could just write a strongly worded letter to the ahole and let him know just how big of an ahole he is.  You could also mail letters to the school board members also letting them know about the incident and how much legal exposure this principal causing the school.

Even if he has changed schools I would still write him and whatever school board he works for to let them know exactly what kind of jerk they hired.  

Just make sure you do have witnesses that heard him tell you to crawl up the stands before writing such a letter to the school board.

Pretty much no excuse for a telling someone to get out of a wheelchair and crawl around. That's really fucked up and I'm sorry you had to go through it. I think you could have pursued something under the ADA especially if you got in contact with a disability advocacy group. Not sure what or if you still could, but he was completely in the wrong.  It certainly sounds inappropriate. Illegal...probably not, unless you had a specific IEP/504 plan that he violated; or perhaps some kind of ADA violation in the construction of the stands. 

Regardless, he didn't "force" you. You could have sat out of the picture, or refused to crawl up and asked for some other type of assistance (like having two of your classmates support you). 

Even then you may be past a statute of limitations; although those can vary based on the state and type of claim.  I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

I just wanted to point out that just because they're related doesn't mean they're going to stick up for one another. You may have more information about whether their relationship gets in the way of doing their job, but in general I don't think you should automatically assume it will be a problem. 

If I was head of the board and one of the principals did this I wouldn't care who the hell they were to me, I would do my job and hold them accountable for being a dick. [removed] [removed] You should have just... not done it?  What's the worst that can happen? [removed] [removed] I have the picture of me in the stands without my wheelchair but that is it. In that picture the cast I was in the protect my new ankle is visible. There was also about 300 witnesses.  >You could just write a strongly worded letter to the ahole and let him know just how big of an ahole he is.

I thought this was standard procedure for anyone graduating high school?

Definitely chew out the board. Their loud embarrassing reputation destruction detector should just be burning through batteries right now. Jerk feels like the wrong word here.


"Monumentally offensive shit stain" feels more accurate. Even if she let a disability advocacy group know about it now, it could still lead to an investigation. I did have an IEP plan, but my parents are the one who made it so I am not sure what it said. I will likely never do anything with this, I have just always felt it was wrong and I wanted to know if I was crazy.  *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

Sure, in retrospect, don't do it. But ... people will do a lot when an authority figure asks them. Sub is called "legal advice" because it's for legal advice.

Trying to shame or blame a teenager for listening to authority in front of all of his peers doesn't constitute as legal advice. I was a shy 17 year old. I had a 50 year old man demanding I do it. I was afraid of him so I did it. Good to know! Thanks for pointing out you have nothing to contribute!

They wouldn't do anything.  That feels like the right way of describing him lol. He honestly was like that the whole time I was on hospital home bound. Another time I had to take a graduation test about a week after one of my largest surgeries. My hospital home bound teacher requested I be allowed to take that graduation test at home with another teacher monitoring the test. He yelled at her that he was tired of making accommodations for me. He was a horrible person.  That and a few more.  lol Yeah that's a good point Well, you're not crazy. He was an ass, and you have every right to feel annoyed and mistreated. He just may not have done anything illegal or sue-worthy. I don't think an IEP would cover that type of disability, only a 504. IEPs are generally for learning disabilities and have goals etc whereas 504s can address purely physical accommodations >parents

I swear to heaven's angels, if this was my child, someone would be getting an earful. 

She didn't mention if her parents were there, but if I saw this happening in real time,  I'd be down there so fast.... In the future.... Stand up for yourself.

It's one thing if the principal is telling you to go to class, stop acting up in the halls, etc.  It's another thing if the principal is humiliating you and risking your health.

I know it's been some time, hopefully you've learned to stand up for yourself. [removed] Boards are made up of a lot more people than just the chair. He can't really prevent this from going forward if the other board members wished to pursue it.  Sorry you went through that it should never happen. Excuse my French but fuck that guy. Would the stands be considered a place of public accommodation and thus legally have to be wheelchair accessible? It may have been a 504. Honestly, I have no idea. My parents went to a meeting to set it up when I started hospital home bound.  My mom had the same reaction. She was not there when it happened. When I told her she tried to go to the school but I was so humiliated that I begged her not too. I realize now I should have let her but at the time I just wanted it to disappear.  I have thanks. I am about to graduate with my bachelors degree and I cannot imagine listening to a person like that again. I was just so afraid he would keep me from graduating.  I didn't presume to try and make any claims to knowing civil law.

It makes me feel good to know I am not crazy In feeling that way about him.  There was a wheelchair area where I asked for my picture to be taken. The principal insisted I crawl to the middle of the stands.   That makes sense. I'm a teacher, not a lawyer, but admin can get in serious trouble for violating the accommodations in a 504 [removed] small town or not, ADA violations are serious business. like federally serious. he can be a cocky dickhole in your small town, but he'll be a cowardly little shit when he's dragging the entire school district through an ADA lawsuit. 

EDIT: you could still complain to the state and have his professional licensed revoked. along with that will be the loss of his job, benefits, and likely pension.  This is most likely illegal, or at the very least a violation of policy. You could report it to your state's Department of Education. Thanks for what you do. If it was not for amazing teachers that helped me with my hospital home bound, I wouldn't have been able to graduate on time.  This. Is the kind of thing that local school boards a redesigned to handle.  Verbal whipping. Is in order, and someone should be fired.  School boards can fire. Dude. Hitting me in the feels <3

Good for you for graduating and getting through that! And for not being crazy bitter about this incident...that takes integrity Aww thank you. Even thought it was only 4 years ago it feels like a lifetime ago.
