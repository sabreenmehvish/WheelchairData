I thought I would share this story about a veteran I met today I go to the local Veterans Center once every other week. As I was leaving after my session, I noticed a big, white Ram truck combat-parked next to me. I immediately noticed the driver side door was open. The driver was getting out. But what I didn't notice was the electric wheelchair behind the open door. As I approached, I saw the wheelchair and the driver who was slowly getting out. That's when I noticed the wheelchair crane in the bed of the truck, over the side. The driver - whom I am assuming was an earlier era veteran - had a Marine Corps cap on. The truck also had multiple USMC decals. He was visibly paralyzed but had some movement.  He saw me and I told him to take his time. I noticed he spoke from the side of his mouth, confirming what I had suspected. He had driven here! A somewhat paralyzed Marine DROVE HIMSELF HERE! I made some small talk about his truck being nice and whatnot. He finally settles into his chair, looks me dead in the eye and thanks me for my service and tells me "Welcome home". For a second I am speechless and return the thanks and the welcome. "You too, man. You, too." For another second I'm in awe and since I feel I can trust this old Marine, I ask him why he parked over here when he could have parked closer in the handicapped spots. He thinks about it and says,"Fuck that. I need to lose weight." I laughed and shook my head and realized in spite of having an obvious disability, this old Marine wasn't going to allow that to get in the way. I figured in his mind he wasn't disabled so why act like it. I mean, I'm assuming this but I could be wrong. His attitude was better than mine would have been.  Only a fucking jarhead. Love it. good on ya! Pure moto. This is a tear-jerker for me... Damn. 

I'm in a multi-generational group at my Vet Center, and it's really awesome. The older guys really give me strength and hope. 

Semper fucking Fi, to that Marine.  YUTYUTYUTYUTYUT
