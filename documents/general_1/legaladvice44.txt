Update! [California] Neighbour constantly blocking my wheelchair access ramp [Here's the link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6dj4qh/california_neighbour_constantly_blocking_my/?st=j8u5lhg8&sh=e0c0b34e)

Hello!

The person who directed me to this legal help forum mentioned that it's customary to give updates once significant progress is made in a case. So, since I'm currently sitting in a car, still a couple hundred miles away from home, this is as good a time as any to tell you guys what's been going on. :)

Following your advice I contacted the authorities to have the area around the ramp marked out as a no-parking spot. They weren't able to help me since the street is owned by my neighbourhood's homeowner association. Now, my house is one of the few in the area that is not part of that organisation, but I decided to contact them anyway. The president turned out to be a wonderful lady who was of immense help to me. She helped resolve the parking situation by designating the area around the ramp as a no-parking spot. I felt bad about inconveniencing my neighbours, but the homeowner association agreed to my idea of extending the street parking zone by a few yards on the other side of my neighbours' house, that way they still have somewhere to park their fifth car. She did all that as a gesture of goodwill without me being a member of their organisation, which made me fall in love with the neighbourhood even more. Also, I'm really glad I didn't have to involve the police.

Since my accessibility issue has been resolved I've decided to pull the trigger and buy the house I live in. I'm currently in the process of finalising the purchase which is taking slightly longer than usual due to a complex ownership situation, still at this point my estate agent is assuring me that there should be no more roadblocks, which makes me really happy. Once I'm the owner of the house I'm planning to join the homeowner association as well. I've also been asked to become their accessibility consultant to help make sure all of their future projects are wheelchair friendly, which is a huge honour to me and makes me confident that this is the right place for me. :)

On top of all that, I've reached an agreement with the homeowner association and two other couples to build a second ramp a little further down the street and split the cost between all of us. Every party, including the homeowner association will be covering a quarter of the price and we have a promise that this time a no-parking spot will be marked out immediatelly. :) The project is set to begin once the purchase of my house is finalised.

Thanks once again for all your help! What started out as a nuisance has become a fantastic adventure that reassured me that I've found a place I can truly call home! Thank you for posting an update!
