Panama City Beach is more than just bad publicity and spring break. Today is the annual veterans baseball game. My grandfather doesn't get out much, but said he wouldn't miss today for anything.  Where was this at? I live on the beach and I totally would have gone if I had known about it. You know they have cleaned up PCB in the past 5 or so years. 
We stayed there a few  years ago and it was nice. Looking to go back this summer with the kids. Would love to spend some time in a condo or something. In no city was I EVER Treated better as an active duty soldier than PC. Forever love this town. I know they're in wheelchairs and all, but do they really need that many infielders? Frank brown park. They have a new field with a special material so it's wheelchair accessible for handicapped players. Apparently they do it every fall for Veterans Day and every spring. This is before they played, before they presented the colors and the national anthem.
