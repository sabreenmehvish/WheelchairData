Recommend a good seating service in SE Michigan? Hi folks, can anyone recommend a good wheelchair seating service in the Detroit area?

My wife can barely walk due to multiple issues with joints and spinal nerves, and has gotten progressively worse over the 10 years she has been on crutches. The University of Michigan has continued their years of a lot of 'non-help' by declaring that she doesn't qualify for a chair when multiple doctors have written documentation stating that she needs one.

Thanks for any suggestions! Your best bet would be to go to www.resna.org and checking out the "Find A Professional" box.

Look for a ATP that works for a company with a few locations. Avoid providers that only have one store as they usually have a hard time getting custom parts. Also avoid the national companies like NuMotion or NSM. They are profit driven and limit what the ATPs can get.  

Any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks! We will check that out!
