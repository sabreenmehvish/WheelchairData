21 [M4F] Illinois -Disabled M Looking 4 Chair-Bound F- Forgive me, I know this isn't exactly a place for personal ads, but I've had zero luck in the r4r Sub willing to give me a chance, due to my disability.

Basically, I'm just looking for someone to chill with, and get to know (hopefully romantically). I'm disabled myself ( mild CP), and find it hard to relate to non-disabled people online, as they're too cosmetically obsessed for my taste...

I'm not in a wheelchair personally, but have been at multiple points in my life for long periods of time. I guess you could say I have a "thing" for Fs in wheelchairs. 

I'm a chill person, honestly. Into Music, Anime, Video Games, and Paranormal/Supernatural stuff.

I don't really expect any real replies, but I'm hoping!

Shoot me a message if you're possibly interested! If not, that's cool, too!

I'm very open! If you have something you're curious about, feel free to ask!
