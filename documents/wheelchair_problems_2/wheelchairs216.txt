Rain jackets designed for wheelchair users Hey friends. So I'm wondering if any of you have had any luck finding a raincoat that has a flap to protect your back from getting all soggy and your legs from getting moist but doesn't look like a trash bag? HMU.  In a similar vein to the head umbrella, I've seen umbrellas specifically made for wheelchairs, they clip on to one of the back bars! But as far as a rain jacket goes, they're ugly as sin but I feel like a rain poncho is usually roomy enough you could fit it over the back. I've worn an [Adaptations by Adrian rain cape](http://adaptationsbyadrian.com/winter-or-rain-cape-custom-made/) for 12 years. They're waterproof-breathable so it's not TOO boggy in there. I get no reimbursement, I just think they're awesome. I've worn them in thunderstorms so hard that the streets flood and I'm fine. I got mine made in hideously bright lime and pink and cars can see me quite well. Thank you so much <3
