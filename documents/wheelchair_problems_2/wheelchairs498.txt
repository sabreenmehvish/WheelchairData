Help with Mobility equipment Hi again. I originally submitted a post to see if I could help anyone with their issues they are having with their manual/power mobility. I deleted that post because it was a personal account and while im not shady, there was some things id like to keep private. I'm very experienced with the DME industry and would like to give advice to anyone that would like a second opinion. i started on the insurance end and eventually worked my way into coming into contact with patients and helping them achieve their acts of daily living through the use of durable medical equipment. i would like to offer suggestions for both insurance and equipment. Not looking to make a sale or anything just want to make sure you guys are aware of possible equipment issues or equipment your eligible for. if you'd like to know the company i work for please PM me i would like to keep that separate from this post. I was the person who asked about swapping out the seat pan in the previous thread. I wanted to ask--if Medicaid has paid for repairs on a chair it didn't originally cover, is it still true that it will cover a new chair? in my experience they will. you will need to go through the whole process again, because the documentation that justified the chair u currently have will not be enough for a chair with a solid seat pan most likely
