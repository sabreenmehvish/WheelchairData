GoBOT! - THE game changing mobility aid (xpost from r/technology) To anyone that spends, or knows someone who spends a significant amount of time in a wheelchair:

My friend Erik Kondo has spent 30 years of his life in a chair following an accident where he lost the use of his legs. He has decided to change the fact that mobility devices marketed to wheelchair users are slow and boring. He has taken the initiative to make a line of assistive devices that offer the opportunity to move in a agile, fun, and versatile manner. If you have not heard, may I introduce you to the GoBOT line!

Using a gyroscopically stabilized motor, some elbow grease, and a passion for pushing the envelope, Erik and his team have created these incredibly versatile mobility aids. The GoBOT line will dramatically improve performance and accessibility for a wide variety of wheelchair users at a modest price point. Currently, we are competing in the Toyota Mobility Unlimited Challenge to make these affordable, fun, and versatile GoBOTs available to the public.
