Seeking Wheelchair Users to Participate in Georgia Tech Research Study The Rehabilitation Engineering and Applied Research (REAR) Lab at Georgia Tech is looking for participants to help us with one of our ongoing studies! Our lab focuses on the research and development of technologies aimed at helping those with disabilities. For this project, we are using pressure mats to measure information about the participant's posture while they are seated on a wheelchair cushion.

Eligible participants must be:

1. A current wheelchair user
2. Aged 18 years or older
3. Able to transfer on and off their      chair independently

Participating in this study involves a single 30-120 minute visit to our lab at Georgia Tech's campus. We would have the participant transfer off their chair, attach the weight shift sensor underneath their cushion, place a pressure mat on top of the cushion, and have them transfer back to their chair. During the study, the participant may be asked to move in their chair and shift their weight at various times. As a thank-you for participating, we will send every participant a $20 gift card.
