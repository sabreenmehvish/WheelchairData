wheelchair issues for my engineering project we are addressing pressure sore issues people have in wheelchairs and building a product that can solve the issue. part of the project is showing it is a issue so i am opening a reddit for people to reply to if they or someone they know has this issue  I supply wheelchairs so I have a different perspective.  The biggest issue I see is people forgetting to weight shift and offload the pressure. A cheap pressure mat that can sense how long out has been since the last shift and send a reminder would be the best item I can think of.  omg thank you that is a great idea
