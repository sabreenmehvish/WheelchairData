Only a matter of time before we can get out of our chairs.  Very cool! I wonder if he's got a new spine in his bag for me :) This kind of thing makes me wonder if they'd ever be able to help me.

I have a connective tissue disorder. I don't make the glue that holds every cell together properly. Every single organ, bone, muscle, tendon, ligament, artery, vein etc is so stupidly weak. I dislocate everything, including spine/neck and ribs.

Exoskeletons as they are still wouldn't help me as the act of moving is part of the problem when the disorder it's gone as far as mine has.

The only exercise I can currently do is in the water and that requires 2 physiotherapists to hold me up, my personal assistant and a lot of equipment.

It made me cry to see her dance again. I miss dancing so much, I truly hope that one day I'll have that chance again.
