Best place/way to purchase an ultra lightweight wheelchair without insurance? Payment plans? New to the wheelchair world, and in need for part time use. My neurologist recommended it to me, and I will be seeking a referral to PT for evaluation soon. A connective tissue disease and an 11.5cm cyst from S1-L4/L5 causes me to need assistance, but it has to be lightweight. I’d like to have a solid ride, and more seat-like than hammock-like.  I also wish power assist options came at a price point of 1-2K or less. 

Here’s the thing: I’m poor as heck, in between filing for SSDI, and been denied state coverage so far. I do have minimal but good credit, though. Any suggestions, tips, or model suggestions would be great! First, Canadian here so I can't help much with insurance stuff, but I do know you are unlikely to get something with a power-assist for under 2k. All power assists that I know of that attach to ultralights are in the 3k-5k range alone.

I'd recommend looking on eBay for something used, especially if you don't need something to your exact measurements. there are often used (and quite nice) TiLites for the $1500 range. Hmm. Well suggestion number 1 is that if at all possible you should get fitted for a chair by a professional. Fit is extremely important and the options can be overwhelming if you don’t know what you’re doing.

As for paying or setting up a payment plan...I wonder if Sportaid.com might be a resource. They sell lightweight chairs directly (without going through a DME distributor which adds on a lot of money). They’re a good way to peruse lightweight chair brands. They mention payment options and they also have a list of funding resources by state.

Power assists are, unfortunately, expensive. They’re actually 2-3x times more expensive than the chair itself. You can probably find a decent lightweight chair in the $2000 range. But power assists are more like 5-6K. pharmacy supply stores often have a few options. my wheelchair only cost me about $150 i think. which i know is still a lot when you're broke. good luck with your journey Sometimes there are even demo or display models for sale at a reduced price I second this EBay suggestion!  Thank you for the info! I’ve found spinlife.com already and it sounds like a similar structure at sport aid so I will check it out and compare.  Glad to have my thoughts confirmed about spending the effort on how to get professionally fitted.  I think I’ll have to go without power assist and have my partner be my power assist for now, unless I could find a grant, but I’m finding that I’m “not disabled enough” for a lot of wheelchair funding grants.  Those wouldn’t be lightweight though... Yes! Forgot about it in the moment, but Spinlife also great!

From my experience (as a life long manual wheelchair user), I would do exactly what it sounds like you’re doing—focus on getting a decent lightweight chair first. And then, if you can, a power assist. The first though is so crucial. Daily activities, it turns out, take up sooo much more of the day than distance moving, as aided by power assist. And the difference between the lightweight chairs and the crap medical chairs is just...they’re not even the same devices. Cars vs golf carts. Bikes vs a scooter with rusty bearings. A computer vs an old calculator. Idk! Just...they’re unbelievably dysfunctional in comparison. And that dysfunction all day long is so disheartening. It makes one think that wheelchairs aren’t functional, when in fact the good ones are very functional. 

So yeah...I’d vote make that the priority. As to fitting, maybe I spoke too strongly there. Fitting can be important. But not as important as a decent chair.  mine weighed like 10 or 15 lbs Thank you for all your help! I have 2 different doctors appointments this week, so I’m hoping they can refer me to a pt place I am already established with. 

I’ve only tried the medical chairs in big stores, and was pleasantly humbled when I realized how much energy and pain I saved, it truly made me giddy at the thought of having something I could push myself. My limitations have been steadily increasing this past year, but I don’t want to be so restricted in my activity level. So your comment on getting a decent lightweight is helpful. I unfortunately don’t have a lump sum of $500 or so to go on eBay and look, so new on a payment program will probably be the route I go down. 

Thank you again! You’re charmingly helpful! 15.0 lbs ≈ 6.8 kilograms ^(1 pound ≈ 0.45kg)
