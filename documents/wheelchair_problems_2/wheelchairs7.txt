Paraplegic man who drug himself across airport floor decides against lawsuit.  Good for him. Travel is really awful in a wheelchair and more of us need to put up a public fuss when we're given horrible customer service. 

I routinely have to wait 15-30 min at security to get frisked by TSA because apparently there are very few women working that job and I have to sit there until one of them is free. Infuriating.  I was in a similar situation back in 2014 in Chicago. It was my last day in the city and I had to catch my train. Well they pulled the train car forward too far and the door was right in front of a Pillar and they couldn’t get the ramp out for me to wheel myself into the train car. I had to physically get out of my wheelchair and crawl up the ramp in front of about 40 people in this train car. About lost my pants from scooting I was so embarrassed. If it makes you feel better it’s no better for guys. :-/ Sorry for your blocked access.

Don't ever feel embarrassed about a reality that cannot be changed.  Props for making it work in the absence of other solutions.

This is the daily reality for hundreds of thousands of people around the world.  Yeah I didn’t let it bother me too much. Got help from some of the people in the train car too so that made me feel a little better about the situation. I'm glad. Lassiez'l les bon temps roulet.
