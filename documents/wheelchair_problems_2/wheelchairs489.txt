Cushion recommendations So, a few months after a car accident, which resulted in my left arm and leg being amputated, infection set in in my right leg, and an emergency amputation was done.  Now that it looks like I will be in a chair more long term, I'm looking to make some improvements..one of those is a nice cushion.  Does anyone have any good recommendations?  Thanks! Roho has set the standard Roho cushions are the best with 4 different air chambers that helps prevent getting clots. I personally like [Verilite](http://www.varilite.com/products_category.aspx?catID=1) more than Roho, but it really depends on your needs. If you're at risk for pressure sores, go with Roho. If not, I'd go for Verilite. Ride Designs has a few different options, all of which give you a bit more stability as it positions your pelvis in a "well". Also great for pressure sores.  Thanks! Thanks! Hmm..ill definitely look into that. Thank you!
