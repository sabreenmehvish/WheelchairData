Wheelchair recommendations? I am looking to get a more rugged wheelchair for my grandmother. One that I can push but is not the flimsy foldable kind she has from her nursing home.

She **loves** going on walks around the lake (paved footpath) and we routinely go for 2-3mile jaunts with her. I would appreciate any feedback...

I do not have any experience with shopping for wheelchairs. My gma was given one when she entered the nursing home as she cannot walk without getting winded/wobbly...I want her to be able to still experience the outdoors that she loves!

I am ok with used, as she does not have much money..

Thanks for your help! I know the [Whirlwind Wheelchairs](http://www.whirlwindwheelchair.org/) are tough and easy to ride. Also the [Grit Freedom Chair](http://www.gogrit.us/) is another one to look at. I bought a used Breezy chair, older model, for about $140. It's a nice chair, comfortable seating (a foam cushion is like $10 on Amazon for additional support), with swing away foot rests. I don't know exactly how old it is but I would say at least 4 and it has held up well. It was retail like $600.  Thanks! I also recommend the GRIT Freedom Chair. They have some refurb models sometimes. If you have any questions, contact the company. They are very responsive. To kind of piggyback off of /u/squiiints comment, a cushion can go a long way for comfort.  I'm currently using a generic folding wheelchair that I bought on Amazon for $135 ([this one](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=drive+blue+streak+wheelchair&sprefix=drive+blue%2Caps%2C673)), and a gel cushion for $25 ([this guy](http://www.amazon.com/NOVA-Medical-Products-Cushion-Wheelchair/dp/B0052JME58?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s01)), and they're holding me over just fine until I can afford my custom chair this fall.  I take my chair on all kinds of terrain and the gel cushion is a great shock absorber. Thanks!

The one she has from the nursing home is the typical folding hospital kind. It is so heavy and difficult to push...whenever we go out I know she feels all the bumps. I do tell her to clench her asshole and to brace for impact. At least we can have a laugh about how shit the chair is :P

That being said, I am **super grateful** to even have one to take her out with! I just want to make it easier for her, her butt, and obviously the chair...I don't want to destroy it by putting too much hard mileage on it :P
