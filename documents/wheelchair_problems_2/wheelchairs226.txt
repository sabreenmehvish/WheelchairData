Power chair users, any suggestions on rain canopies or umbrellas for when I'm out in the rain? I haven't been able to find an easy rain umbrella or canopy solution. Preferably a canopy that can fold away when not in use. Any suggestions? I don't.  I've been looking at something like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FH6CS2/

But haven't tried it out yet.  Wouldn't be good for general mobility, more for being still w/ rain (side of sporting event, etc). I have one of these and it works pretty good.

First one lasted ~8 years, then my chair dimensions changed so it wasn't safe (cape in wheels = death by Isadora). Second one has lasted 10 years. I didn't get wet in downpour that closed some city streets due to flooding. Got second one is super bright (ugly) colors and haven't been hit by a car since. Yeah, that plus wind is going to be bad. You can get windproof umbrellas, they let air through when it gets too strong, but still. 

A simple canopy thing would be cool
