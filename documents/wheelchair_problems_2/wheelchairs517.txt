Luggage suggestions My brothers and I will be going to Europe this summer for 2-3 weeks and we have started to slowly prepare. I just bought them travel backpacks for Christmas (Osprey Farpoint 70L). I was curious so I tried to put one on the back of my wheelchair, and it actually fit quite well. I normally travel with a duffel bag (just on my lap), but I need to a new one get one for this trip anyways.

I'm just wondering if anyone has traveled with a huge backpack. Was it a headache, or was it convenient? I can imagine it will be nice for when I'm in the airport, but taking it off and on my wheelchair might get annoying.

If I should just stick with a duffel bag, is there a 50L-65L duffel bag you would suggest? Yes the Eagle Creek duffle bag I got fits over the back of my chair. It is an ultralight bag. Link here. http://shop.eaglecreek.com/cargo-hauler-duffel-120l-xl/d/1529C1696?CategoryId=339

Have a great vacation. Thanks. I was actually looking at these in the 60L size yesterday.
