We are a group of engineers conducting research for a project to create a concept wheelchair. This form will be used to give us an insight on what users currently use and what aspects of a wheelchair could be improved. Any response is much appreciated!  I wish companies, students etc would stop treating the disability subs as their personal information pools and test subjects. I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
