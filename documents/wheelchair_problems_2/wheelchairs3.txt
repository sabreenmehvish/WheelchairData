My new whip, TiLite TRA  Love it. ZRA here. I really like the slim padding on yours. I want those rims too, I got a huge deal on mine as I was the exact measurements for one he had sitting around for a year that was never picked up. Only downside was I didn't get your rim set. That backrest looks comfy as shit! nice!  I need a new one BADLY!
 Looks great! I'm sure you're enjoying it ðŸ˜Š  Thanks! I love how light it is, and I actually got my rims from my old chair they are just an extra I got right out of the hospital. Also yeah a deal would be great, it's pretty expensive hah, but I got DVR to cover the whole cost for me! it is! its an ADI, wish it was a tad bit smaller though
 Medicaid got mine, but there was a good chance I would have had to pay for it. Have you seen the Freewheel? Which back is it? Really Medicaid got you a TRA!? That's awesome. No but I have now ha, as a quad this would be great and not so great because pushing on grass and stuff is hard but if I were to travel to other country's or if I ever have kids I would definitely scoop one up. It looks like the 13" Carbon fiber series, thought I ordered a 10", I do know it's a 4" deep though. A ZRA, I was very happy with it :) I want to grab a set of off road tires and the wheel. Cool.  I'm looking for a seat back that's really deep vertically (like top to bottom, a big hump), but not at all deep side-to-side.  Haven't found one yet.  But this one does look really comfortable/padded. Nice I had a aero z befor this chair, was just over the open frame, didn't need it. I got some off rode tires, they go flat easy :( lot of upkeep but pretty bad ass.
 As from what I've seen, most people here in CO who use a fixed solid back and can afford it go with ADI, I personally really like it. Really comfy compared to my old Jay and super light weight. As for a hump I'm not sure what you mean.
