Wheelchair Design Survey - Please help! Hello, I am part of a Biomedical Engineering Senior Design Team at the University of Texas at San Antonio. For our project, we want to create an attachment for a wheelchair to improve stability. 

I am posting here to find people who would be willing to answer some anonymous survey questions to help us design the best device we possibly can. If you have the time, please fill out the survey below. 

No personal information will be recorded (unless you want to be a part of our future surveys). If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If you know anyone else who uses a wheelchair and would be willing to fill out this survey, please forward it along. 
Thank you for your time!

Breaks on wheelchairs are for parking , wouldn't last a week if you used them to break . 

Good luck Thank you so much!
