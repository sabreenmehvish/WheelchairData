I'm a part of a university group trying to reduce wrist/arm injuries from wheelchair use. Please help by taking our quick survey! We are students from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside that are currently working with a company trying to reduce wrist, arm, and shoulder injuries from prolonged wheelchair use.


We are just looking for some general information at this point, and the survey will only take 5 minutes of your time. Thank you!
