1st Time Flat Tire Inquiry Hello fellow humans. I've been disabled for about 2 years, but I've only had this Catalyst wheelchair for like 3 months. I got a flat tire taking it out for the day and upon attempting to refill it with a bike pump, it seems to lose air the second I sit back down. Any easy way to see if there's a spot on the wheel to patch somehow? I can't hear any air coming out, so I assume the problem is closer to the wheel well. I've thought about trying a bike-shop, but I don't know any in Denver really, or if that idea has any merit if anyone else has tried that before?

Figured I'd ask online to save me getting a prescription for a new wheel from Medicaid, since as you can imagine it's significantly harder to get around at the moment :)

https://i.redd.it/3xfp1cvmzoh11.jpg Bike shop for sure. They'll be able to determine the issue, and possibly patch the tube/tire if it's fixable. Depending on the size of your wheels, they may even have tubes and tires to replace whatever is needed. The 2 bike shops I visit don't stock 25" tires like I need, but they've been able to determine a slightly oversized 24" tube that fits my setup wheel and get me squared away with new tubes at least. 1. Check the valve. Put some soapy water (or spit) in the valve and see if it blows bubbles. Can be an easy fix.
2. Take the inner tube out and listen with the tube compressed.
3. Put the tube in water and look for bubbles.

A bike shop will do all these things for you. Take the tyre off, put the inner under water and fill it a bit, you should be able to see the air coming out where the puncture is. I tend to just replace the inner instead of patching as the patches don't tend to last very long. A bike shop will definitely be able to help you out if you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself. I suggest you get a patch kit.

* Patches - Buy in bulk on amazon/eBay etc

* Levers for removing the tire from the rim

* Buffer - For buffing the tube surface

* Rubber cement - I prefer the large tubes of it from the auto store not the tiny once you usually see in bike patch kits.

* Pump Thanks for the confirmation suggestion! I'll have to remember that sizing diff. To be completely honest, I get confused about the tire sizing. I just read that 25" wheelchair tires are 559 size, which is the same as what bike shops sell as 26" tires. Who knows.... regardless, they should be able to help. In Florida, at least, there are mobile bike repair guys that will come to your house and change tubes. If you communicate using the Erto size designations, rather than inches, they'll know what you need.  (E.g.  540, 559, 590, 700c instead of 24", 25", 26", 27", etc) 559 is to the "bead" of the tire. Your 25x1 tire will fit the same rim as a 26x2 mountain bike tire.  


This should help:

I just wish the bike shops would actually try to fit a tire in the past when I said it's a 25", but it's not a bicycle 25". 

It's been a year or so, I realized I probably had it wrong after I posted. Thanks for the link!
