Question wheelchair customization spoke guards specifically? Has anyone used air release vinyl decals on wheelchairs, specifically spoke guards?   Do they stay looking nice?   

I am considering ordering [this or similar] (http://www.ebay.com/itm/Wheelchair-Spoke-Guard-protector-SKINS-Mickey-Mouse-Custom-Designs-Personalised-/251851186454)  from Ebay for ds's new wheelchair.   I am looking for something that will appeal to a 10 year old who still functions mentally as a 2 year old but won't make him stand out as too childish.   I'm not crazy about the idea of advertising his name to every stranger (due to his trusting naive nature) so may put something generic like "Believe in Magic."
