Man hit and killed while crossing street in a wheelchair in Phoenix  Hi I live in the UK. Wheelchairs, and especially mobility scooters are now very popular. Unfortunately some of the users get themselves into very dangerous positions. Such as crossing busy highways. So, i am reading more and more stories about disabled and elderly people being involved in accidents!! very sad . Accidents involving rollers happen almost 2-3 times a day in the US. 
Be safe wheeling Usually I notice that accidents involve powerchairs although there are many more manual chair users. I wonder why?
