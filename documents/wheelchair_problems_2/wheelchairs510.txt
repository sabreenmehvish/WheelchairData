Wheelchair Tray Padding Solutions I have a clear polycarbonate tray for my wheelchair that I have to lean against in order to sit forward. I have always had a problem with finding a good padding option. Currently, I use two layers of padding, a dense layer of foam for support and a pool noodle on top. Unfortunately, the pool noodle has become unusable and I cant find a decent pool noodle as a replacement. So, my question is can anyone suggest a good padding alternative?

Example of what my tray looks like: [Link](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71720dDZ3dL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg) pipe insulation ...   wheel around home depot or Menards What about a wheelchair pad? Could be cut down to fit the tray and is made to sit on constantly so the foam holds up well.  Custom roho cell arrangement?  I've thought about trying that, I just hope it doesn't break down too quickly.
