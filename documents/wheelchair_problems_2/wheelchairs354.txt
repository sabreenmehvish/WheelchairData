I made a video on the SmartDrive MX2 power assist.  [deleted] This is awesome my triceps only twitch, only one wrist bends so I wonder if I'd get good use with it. I need to strengthen my core, was just in the hospital awhile. Thanks! No I haven't, is it good?  It's pretty sensitive, a clapping motion can turn it off.  Wow that's so cool  Yeah! So if you can push a wheelchair and move your forearm as if you were slapping your hip you should be able to get good use of it.  Another advantage is unlimited choice of pushrims. The only ones I've succeeded with so far are Natural Fit lts with supergrip. So much much better for those with more complex/severe disabilities than things which only work with basic rims.
