Modifying Modular Home to Accommodate Wheelchair I have no idea where to ask this, but does anyone know if it is possible to widen inside doorways in manufactured homes? The only ones we can find are 28 inch and we need 33. Thank you!! By manufactured home, you mean basically a mobile home, right? This question was asked and answered here:
