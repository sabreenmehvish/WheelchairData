WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY?  I usually call ahead and asks most of these questions for my girlfriend. You’d be surprised on how little attention people pay to some of these details when they tell you about a place and you only realize it when you get there.


Like for instance, it’s happened that we heard the place had totally even floors, big enough restrooms for her to go by herself with her chair...only to arrive and find out that there was a six to eight inch step at the entrance.  we had to argue with a hotel in switzerland (international chain, 4 stars - so not a small one) that they can’t sell a room as “wheelchair accessible” (on booking and their own website) if their entrance has 5 steps and no ramp or anything else.

their argument: “but if you’re inside the hotel, you can reach the room and everything inside with a wheelchair”. i mean: wtf?
