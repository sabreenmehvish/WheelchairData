Wheelchair skills program. Because, somethings we need pointed out to us.  Well people with Down's syndrome do need things pointed out to them. It's interesting that "Descends stairs" is on the Manual Wheelchair User training/testing list.  I was *never* taught to do this, and I have been in a wheelchair for over 20 years.

I have seen many people pull it off successfully, but have never been able to take it on myself. Does descend mean fall down? It's not like it matters if you break your legs or lose the use of them. My physiotherapist just tells me to bum shuffle on my own stairs, and not to bother with public ones. Haha fag. You've never had a push down stairs? No. > bum shuffle

I love this term. > Haha fag.

Not sure why that's necessary... Ha. Ha. Ha. It's accurate :p
