How a guy in a wheelchair went from never dating to several dates per week  It's interesting that I find this tonight.  Recently, I realized that I have a deep-seated fear of not ever being good enough for someone else.  I'm divorced, and all of my relationships since then have run aground badly.

Admittedly, I've been pretty morose about it, and wondering if I'll ever be able to pull myself out of this funk.

Thanks for the inspiration. Of course, thanks for reading! Sorry to hear about your relationships - if it helps, I still have that fear come up sometimes. I've been meditating lately and it has worked wonders on my mental state, perhaps it will help you? http://youtu.be/waYNEDZxEPY
