Question regarding Ramp Ease of Access Hello,
I am a college student in Colorado and I noticed that my university, in an attempt to make locations more accessible, has replaced many short stairways with steep ramps (approx. 15 degrees). Because of this I was wondering if there are simply ramps too steep to ascend and what people do to circumvent this potential problem. Thanks! There are definitely ramps too steep to ascend, and ramps too steep to descend. For me, I can actually ascend slightly steeper ramps then I can safely descend, because the coefficient of friction fails me more easily on descent. 

The two limiting factors, I think, are force and friction. Force--how hard can you push up a hill, and friction--how much can your tires grip to prevent you from sliding down an incline. Another relevant factor, especially when descending, is just geometry--can you go down that angle without flipping over at the intersection with flat ground.

The ADA standard ramps have a 1:8 ratio of height:length, so around half the angle of these steep ramps. Personally, I wouldn't be able to use the ramps you describe on my own, and they definitely don't satisfy legal ADA requirements for providing ramps (in the USA that is). 

However, hey, better than nothing I suppose--they're still better than stairs! They probably enable people to be helped up and down more easily, if needed. My university has the same problem.  And yes it's frustrating.     My work around is to go up them backwards.   I have a much lower chance of slipping back down the ramp if my big wheels go first--and if I do go back down at least I'm facing forward rather than backwards.
