Mobility Couldn't be Easier  mobility ***could*** be easier, i promise. it's not just about poorly made, cheap mobility devices (like the ones listed in the article) either. the physical environment plays a huge role and a lot of the chairs in this article can get the user outside but try them in the grass or at a family member's house that has 4 inch threshold...    
    sorry to be a downer but i must vent. this article is bullshit and this sub doesn't seem to notice the amount of ableism accidentally poured all over it. People notice, right now this post is sitting at 0 points. I feel like there's a lot of spam here from people who aren't disabled or who are just trying to sell their product. It's a shame really.  Well alot of people can't afford much more than these "cheap mobility devices"  I appreciate the feedback.   I realize that everyone that is in a wheelchair is not a senior citizen, but some are,  and there are many helpful resources for such on the website.   Do you recommend an all round chair, that the average person could possibly afford?   average people cannot afford power chairs... it is insurance or medicare that *allow* chairs to be bought, many times ignoring or brushing off pieces of equipment that would be helpful to the individual because of costs. i'd recommend seeking help from a primary care physician or a physical therapist. i'd never recommend an individual or family member to try and buy a chair without help. Thanks
