Help! Buying a custom, lightweight WC I just found out Medicare will only cover me buying a basic lightweight WC. I'm willing to buy myself a custom, heavy duty chair. I'm looking at the website spinlife.com and model aero z series 2. 

Any advice on buying a heavy duty chair?  Are you obese? Heavy duty chairs are, typically, built for folks weighing over 250lbs.

That said, TiLite has really great geometry and some really great welders. I'm over the moon with my TiLite so I think the Aero Z would also be a solid chair. Get TI-Light! It's great me and my chair go through it all!  What exactly are your concerns? I have the titanium version of the aero z (the ZRA) and I love it.

What exactly do you mean by "heavy duty". Are you over the recommended weight limit? If so I'd contact the company and see if they can custom make one.   By heavy duty I mean better quality. Will last for 5 years sort of thing. I'm under 140lbs. 

I found the aero z and was talking to the sales rep when my bf got home. I was really upset about Medicare bullshit. My bf suggested I ask the ppl of Reddit before committing to something so expensive. 

I feel like I'm investing into myself and my happiness/mobility. 

The aero z looks like the awesome WC I desire :) Glad to heard y'all like yours :)
 In that case, yeah, you generally can't go wrong with a TiLite. I'm almost on year 4 with mine and although I am eyeing a new one (I want to change the back and the wheels) I'm sure it will last another 4, at least.
