Why are wheelchair prices so jacked?  This blog is only partially correct. It uses MSRP numbers instead of actual billed allowables. Wheelchairs are expensive because of the regulatory certifications and testing they are put through. Take high end power wheelchairs. Each configuration of a single model has to be put through transit testing at $50,000 per test. So base model with captains chair,  base with solid seat pan and captains back, base with solid seat and sling back, base with rehab seat, base with rehab seat and tilt, base with rehab seat and recline, base with rehab seat with tilt and recline,  etc.   Each configuration requires its own $50,000 test and that is just one model of chair.  That is just one test that a chair must go through send there are several tests needed to certify a chair.   

Now back to MSRP/retail price.  I don't know any company that sells based on MSRP for any chair beyond the standard hospital chair.   If you want a custom chair and want to pay out of pocket, DME companies will offer a steep discount.  Self pay costs a LOT less than billing insurance so we offer discounts.  yeah same, general price for a group 3 from permobil can sometimes be 40-50k, but we sell them self pay from anywhere betwen 20-30k. 

insurance companies and medicare also dictate how much a piece of equipment will cost.
