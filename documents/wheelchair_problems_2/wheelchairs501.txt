Question about changing the space in rims. Greetings guys,

I'm considering changing the spacing on my basketball wheels. I wanted to know from you what it will entail and roughly how long it will take. I know I'll have to take off the main tyre and the inner tubes but what I don't know is how the rim is installed. Is it just a simple nut and bolt set up or something more annoying?


Thanks so much.



 If you are talking about moving the rims in closer or farther from the wheel it is just a bolt and nut. Longest part of the job is removing and replacing the tubes and tires.  You might have to decide whether to cut the tabs off too if they stick out on the other side of your wheel rims (if you're moving your push rims closer in to the wheel rim) Thank you so much! I'll attempt it today then. :)
