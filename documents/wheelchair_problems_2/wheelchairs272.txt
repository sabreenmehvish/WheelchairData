When four wheels aren't enough  I absolutely love seeing wheelchairs like this but it still kills me at the same time. I once had one like this come into our shop for a simple tire replacement.  Turns out you needed an actual automotive tire machine to get the job done.  Also, more wheels means more money; each wheel has its own electric motor that will generally require replacement after two years. For a normal wheelchair this comes out to approximately $1,000.00 for each motor if done by a decent DME provider.  I can only imagine how much it would cost to replace a specialized/custom motor like this and not to mention the labor cost associated with it. 

What I want to see is a chair like this, made with relatively cheap/available parts.  In the wheelchair world, simpler design and construction usually leads to better reliability. That's just my opinion though.   I couldn't agree with you more on the cost and complexity of the design of this and other chairs on the market, but I believe it was Gandhi who said "Be the change you want to see in the world"
