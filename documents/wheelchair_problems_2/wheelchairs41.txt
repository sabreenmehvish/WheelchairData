'End The Awkward' Bending Over To A Wheelchair User - Scope's campaign w/a sense of humor  I find it hilarious how many people do this when you'd expect them to know better.

I've even had rehab nurses and audiologists who spend all day around wheelchair users and/or deaf people that do the awkward "bend down and get in my face" thing. 

It's bad enough when they see the powerchair, I find it's even worse if I mention that I'm deaf too. 

Bending down and shouting in my face or being patronising by talking reaaaaaalllyyy sloooooowwwyyy is really not helping folks!!! 

Shouting or slowing down just distorts mouth movements making lipreading harder. Bending down to me just puts us both at an awkward angle where I'll struggle to see your face and you don't really know what to do with yourself! I don't mind the bend vs. stand point, I'm indifferent towards it. What you really need to do is back up so I can look at you. Don't get in my face, or loom over me.  Some people are taught that eye-to-eye contact is best. I really don't like it when people 'bend over', but I don't care if someone kneels.   Great post. Thanks for sharing
