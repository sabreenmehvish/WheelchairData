A Question for Individuals with Service Dogs Hi everyone! I am developing a project in school that that will assist wheelchair users play with their service dogs. It is a tennis ball launcher that can be easily attached and detached from the wheelchair’s handle. I was wondering if you guys could give me any advice on it, or maybe just tell me whether it’s a good idea or not. 
Thanks! I’m not sure what advice you need, but it’s definitely a product I would buy! Like a gun style of ball launcher, or more like a lacrosse stick's style? I don’t have a service dog, just a regular companion dog, but I too would be interested in this. We wheel to the dog park, but I definitely can’t throw the ball as far as I could when I was more mobile, and he gives me the sad judgey look.  Yeah sort of like a cannon
