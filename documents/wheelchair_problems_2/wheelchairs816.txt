Why complicate a simple design, add moving parts and make it heavier???  I know this is just a prototype but it looks heavy.  I saw something similar a few years back, same idea, but it was basically just a lever that attached to the wheels. I just did a quick google search and it looks like a couple companies so make just a lever-controlled wheel.

But I agree, I know it's just a prototype, but it looks much more bulky - sorta in between a manual and an electric... but they already have those in much nicer, more compact designs.
