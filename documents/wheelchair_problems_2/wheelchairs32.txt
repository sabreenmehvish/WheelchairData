My New Wheelchair Electric Bicycle Attachment! | Power Assist  Im looking at getting one of these! I'm going to save up for a cheaper one however. Thanks for this video it really gives me an idea of what to expect :) I’m looking into getting something like this. Do you have trouble navigating in it? I’m worried I’d crash into stuff or it’d take up too much space to use in public.  Do you have any clear videos of how to attach?  Also, where did you buy (aliexpress?) I hope you get one! :) Mine was 600€, the brand ones are over 4k :/ No trouble navigating, super easy! Controllable, feels safe. I wouldn’t use it in a shop maybe, since it is an extension and harder to get around in small spaces and indoors! No, I don’t have an attaching video, it’s not too hard, but help is necessary. 
I bought from alibaba, just search cne bikes and research a bit to locate the addon! :)
