A nice day in my wheelchair! Documented video  I am in a wheelchair as well and the honesty and beauty of that film made me honestly start to tear up. I think you did a wonderful job with it and I am very interested in seeing what the rest of your channel is like.  Great job. That is the sweetest thing I've heard in a while! I had no idea it'd be as touching, but I loved making it! Thank you.  Yes, it is a great video. I felt I was there with you. 

What was that you put in your coffee? :)
  It's a caramel syrup (instead of sugar) :)
