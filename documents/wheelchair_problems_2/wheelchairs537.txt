Any folks in Seattle? I am a volunteer builder for Magic Wheelchair. We build EPIC Halloween costumes for kids in wheelchairs. We are currently looking for kids in the Seattle area. If you know if any kids who might be interested send them to the website below and submit a request.

If you are in Seattle and might be interested in helping build, PM me.

 Not a kiddo but a teacher who uses a wheelchair and teaches in elementary school. Fun idea!! Are you in Seattle? Yes, The north end of the Seattle area. And now that I'm thinking I have a 6 year old who uses a walker in the school. Do you pimp those out? Cool, We are in NE Seattle. I think a walker would be in our scope. Please direct his/her parents to the website.
