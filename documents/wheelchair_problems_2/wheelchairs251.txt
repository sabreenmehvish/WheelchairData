Cheap wheelchair casters get stuck in small care center rooms - suggestions? My mom has a Medicare-provided standard self-propelled wheelchair and the front casters get sideways when she is moving about her room causing her to get stuck. They have been lubricated and the wheelchair company looked at it and said things were ok but she is still having trouble making it work. She doesn't want a power chair. Please help me figure out a good solution for this. You can ask for a smaller (narrow) caster. Usually when they stick it is because the person in the chair does not have enough strength to overcome the friction on the foot print off the caster. If she is already using a narrow (1" or less) then it may be time to talk about a PWC a little more seriously. As a provider there is only so much we can do before limitation in strength forces our direction.  Do you mean that the front casters go sideways (90 degrees), and then won't turn, so her chair can't go forward since the front wheels are not in line w/ her direction?

Easiest problem would be a bad bearing in the caster fork; not the wheel itself, but the fork that turns (left/right/etc).  But if the wheelchair company looked at it and said it was ok, that shouldn't be it.

One problem that's hard to find is if the caster fork is rubbing against the wheelchair, but only for certain angles & directions.  Usually happens when the bearing is a little worn, so the fork can turn a little.  The fork will "bind" and get stuck, but only in certain directions and circumstances.  Going forward, fine.  Going backward, but wheel turns to the left, bad.

Pull off the fork & pull it off... is it worn only in one spot or one side?  That's probably the problem.
