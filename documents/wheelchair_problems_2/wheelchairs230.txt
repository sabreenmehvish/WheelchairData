Anyone know of an affordable adjustable height wheelchair that will facilitate transfer between the wheelchair and a bed? My dads mother is having issues with mobility and we are trying to help her by getting her a wheelchair so she can get around the house. My dad is from north africa but we live in the US now, but his mother still lives there. Doing a quick google search, it looks like a lot of adjustable height wheelchairs are very expensive and heavy. Being heavy will make it difficult to ship. Some that I've seen are $2000+ and weigh over 200lbs. Can anyone recommend a reasonably priced wheelchair that is sturdy and height adjustable and easy to ship and assemble? Attacking the problem from another angle, is the bed too high? You can get low profile box springs to lower the bed, it dropped mine 6 inches.  Yeah, we were just thinking that after I posted this lol. I was just looking around on google and didn't see anything that wasn't exorbitantly expensive. I thought there would be plenty of wheelchairs out there that had a similar mechanism to a desk chair and could move up and down similarly. Was thinking that something like that could be in the $2-$300 range. It would be nice for the wheelchair to be adjustable though so that it would be easier to get in and out of different places like chairs, couches, bed, toilet, etc. you wouldn't have to worry about adjusting everything to fit the chair's height.
