Side guards Got new side guards, and the tech told me that they're supposed to be placed with the screws facing inwards. Is this guy wrong, or have I been doing it incorrectly for years? Seems to me it could go either way. Did the tech mean that the heads of the screws should be on the inside? That makes sense to me, because your clothes would be less likely to get caught on them. Can you post a photo? He said that the heads of the screws should go on the inside. Not sure why. Perhaps if the screws are the other way, they might catch your clothes ?
