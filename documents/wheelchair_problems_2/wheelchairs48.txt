Wheelchair accessible mini-taxis provided in Indonesia  I want one. It would have to be scooter based so I could use hand throttle and brakes, but I would go everywhere with that.  This is a cool thing to hear from the region. Not just the taxis, but the article mentions quite a bit more. Granted, itâ€™s all for a one-time event. But hopefully one-time events of this magnitude can have long term effects. A definite argument for the Paralympics!  once the mind of community is exposed to what is possible, it could remain open to solutions for accessibility.
