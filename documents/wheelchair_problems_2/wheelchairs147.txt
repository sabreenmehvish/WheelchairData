Posture and Pressure Management for Wheelchair Users Survey  Just took this, but there were a lot of errors with the wording of some questions and available answers. For instance, the selections for several questions didn't seem to make a lot of sense, and from my point of view, the idea of an average wheelchair user is difficult to pin. Hope this is useful Hi. Thank you ever so much for your feedback, it is really useful to improve this survey so that it makes sense to every participant. Could you please provide me with further details as what exactly did not make sense so that I can make amendments. 
Would you be interested in being interviewed? I can arrange a Skype call. Please let me know your thoughts on this. Thanks, Leigh 
 Sounds good to me! Feel free to shoot me a pm. I'm not always great at getting back quickly, but I'll try
