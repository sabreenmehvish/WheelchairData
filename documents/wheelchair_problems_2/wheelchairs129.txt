Testing a Panthera wheelchair!  From someone who has a Panthera, they really are incredible. They can be super easy to tip backwards. I notice mine has a razor thin line between balance and falling where my heavier chairs are much more forgiving. Still the fact it weighs like 11lbs with wheels and cushion is awesome.  thanks for sharing  ♥︎
