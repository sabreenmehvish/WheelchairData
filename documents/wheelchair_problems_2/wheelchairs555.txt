Seeking your wheelchair experience I'm a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and I'm looking for wheelchair users to answer some questions I have about wheelchair cushions for a class project. Your input will help guide the development of a new cushion technology and really help me out. Please let me know if you can help by answering a few questions. What're your questions?  I am a wheelchair user for 22 years ask me anything  What kind of cushion do you currently use? Are there any issues that you experience or things that you would like to improve? What was the process like to select and pay for your current cushion? Thanks. Same questions to start: What kind of cushion do you currently use? Are there any issues that you experience or things that you would like to improve? What was the process like to select and pay for your current cushion? Thanks. I use a Java cushion, and I've only been in a wheelchair for a little over four months, so I haven't had any issues with it yet. One thing I might want to change is the thickness of the cushion, I think I thinner one might be nice. The process of selecting it was interesting, at the rehab hospital they had me try out two different types, and they used a pressure mapping mat that I sat on to compare them. Insurance paid for it for the most part I believe.  I use a four inch Roho. It's an air cushion that has a bunch of little cells that hold the air. The staff at rehab suggested the cushion due to me having a desk job. I was also pressure mapped by the representative of a DME provider . Insurance covered a great deal of the cost.

I like the cushion just fine. Don't know that there is anything i would change.
