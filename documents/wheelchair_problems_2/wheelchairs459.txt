Need help choosing power chair rack with ramp that folds up when not in use. Honda Odyssey minivan.  Bariatric power chair. Prefer ability to fold rack up against van when not carrying chair. 

Rack user has limited strength so ease of use is essential. 

Also, how is the wheelchair secured? Are there kits or diagrammed suggestions?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. My father is very ill and wheelchair van rental starts at 100 per day.  I don't know a lot about these, but I do have to say to make sure that you get one that will handle the size/weight of your chair properly...if your chair is 325 lbs, I think I would error on the side of caution and get one that is rated for 400+ instead of the 350 lbs rating.  Unfortunately, the fold up variety with ramps don't seem quite as heavy duty as the non-folding (in my limited experience).  


You will need some kind of tie down strap kit for the chair.  Every chair is different, so most wheelchair carrier is not going to come with any detailed instructions...probably just say to make sure you fully secure your load.  You will want some kind of ratcheting tie down straps...I would suggest trying several varieties at your local hardware store because some are easier to use than others (and you want this to be quick and easy).  The straps will need to hook to the lift and then to (or around) the wheelchair.


You can also go with an electric folding platform [similar to this](https://www.discountramps.com/silver-spring-electric-power-chair-scooter-lift-carrier/p/DR-300) which are nice, but expensive.  These usually have built in straps though. Thank you so much for the info. Iâ€™ll make sure the carrier can handle the weight and I would never have thought of ratcheting straps. This was a lot of help.
