Happy travels! I would perhaps mention that the Meiji shrine is, very beautiful, but can be difficult to push through the gravel while using the wheelchair. Almost everything else though as easy to get around in a wheelchair. Also, protip: very commonly, the yellow strips meant to help vision impaired folks through the subway or common outdoor areas will also bring you to the accessible entrance/lift. :) Thank you for this guide, I wish I had it (and your incredible map) when I went to Tokyo last March. :) Thank you for that added detail. It's super important. You're also right about the yellow guides. That's a super pro tip, thank you!

I'm sorry I didn't get this out early enough to help you! I hope you come back in the future though! Also - I credited you on my post for the protip. Thank-you! You are so sweet! Thank you so much. I had an amazing time there.  I'm glad to hear that! ^^ Happy travels in the future too!
