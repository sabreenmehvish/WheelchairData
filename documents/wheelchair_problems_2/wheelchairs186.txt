Spinergy wheels question Hello,

My question to those who have/had these wheelset: do you think it worth money you paid?
Is there any chance to get it through the insurance?
Are there any other brands, similar by a quality/look, but more cheap?

Thank you for advise!

 I think they're worth it, they look cooler and they're easier to load in/out of a car by myself. I couldn't get insurance to pay for them though, but I assume that varies by insurance provider I love mine! Insurance did not pay. Overall it isn’t the weight for me but the spacing of the spokes that’s the big difference. Regular spacing gets my fingers caught taking it apart and putting it on the car. So if you can’t swing Spinergies there may be an option to at least reduce spoke count or something.  Mine weigh nearly 2/3 less than my previous ones, over all its not a buge weight reduction when you add in the chair BUT every bit helps. Plus they look really cool! I like mine a lot. So much lighter than all the other wheels I’ve had. Plus they look so darn nice. Insurance did pay for mine, but I have unusually good insurance through my employer. Honestly not sure if there are other competitive options! I’d be interested to know if you find any.  Science says they perform better. I agree. They are stronger, lighter and much more rigid in lateral stiffnes. The are also way longer lasting.

You get more options for tires and let's not forget the color options.

I run my own mobility company and can get you therm at near cost. PM me for details.  Thanks everybody for great help and explanations!

Just learned about Sun Components Fusion wheelset, it has 12 spokes option too, as the Spinergy, however price is in 3(!) times cheaper.

Does anybody know what the animal is it? One difference I found is that Fusion has no color options...

 Love my spinergy wheels.
