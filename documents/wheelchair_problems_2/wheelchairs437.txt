Help Me Design a better Manual and Electric Wheel Chair! Hello Everyone! I need your help with an engineering design project for my senior engineering thesis. My group is looking to build a device that will help people with mobility issues, and we have a few questions for your consideration. Please feel free to give me any other feedback that you may have. The survey is a google form linked below and should only take a few minutes of your time. Thanks!

The responses in here will be taken into consideration when designing our senior design projects. No personal identifying information is asked for in the survey, and replies are completely anonymous. Data from multiple choices may be included in figures and short answer replies may be quoted in the final thesis paper. I feel its way too broad a topic. There are very specific wheelchairs these days that are custom made for people that suit there specific needs. Wheelchairs that benefit off road and cheap off road versions that help in third world countries. Ones built for sport and everyday life. ones that turn your everyday chair into off an road (freewheel) or a scooter ([https://uk.redbrain.shop/search?q=36V+250W+e-Wheelchair+Tractor&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIivTy0JD53QIVqLXtCh3EVAymEAQYBCABEgI\_DvD\_BwE](https://uk.redbrain.shop/search?q=36V+250W+e-Wheelchair+Tractor&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIivTy0JD53QIVqLXtCh3EVAymEAQYBCABEgI_DvD_BwE)). The issue is, its too expensive. i want a free wheel. i want a wheelchair suitcase. i cant fork out a couple grand for stuff that may actually break on me and then im screwed.

I say, research the social and medical model of disability as i am honestly sick and tired of wheelchairs that go down stairs. that doesnt benefit me and is stupid. Its stupid to get a disabled person to buy a super expensive chair rather than change the environment so its accessible for everyone.   


&#x200B; You have to understand that every week or two a student comes here and asks for a survey to be filled out, People are not exactly standing in line to fill out yet another one. Hey, i also need help in the same category.

Well, i have a subject about product development, and the project is about how can we improve the wheelchair.

We were asked to do surveys and interviews with people who use or know anyone who uses a wheelchair. But i couldn't find anyone. :/

Had some few ideas.. But they weren't enough.. And my lack of knowledge about them couldn't inspire me to think of anything.

Hope you can help me with my project with any basic ideas i can use..

Here are my ideas..

\-For elders, most of them have bad blood pressure and increased risk of strokes or a heart attacks.

>So we'll add blood pressure sensor, and if the blood pressure of the patient goes to a danger level. An SOS message is sent to emergency, to help save the patient.

  


\-Sitting in the same place without movement will cause back pain.

>Moving chair (massage chair) to help prevent it from happening.

  


\-These devices needs power to work.

>The power needed to power up the devices is generated by a battery, the battery can be charged by a power outlet and by the motion of the wheel.

  


\-leather seats causes sweating.

>change leather into a breathable fabric covering a comfortable memory foam. I understand if you don't want to fill it out. Thanks I understand if you don't want to fill it out. Thanks
