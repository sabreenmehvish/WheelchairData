Alternative to using a wheelchair? I have muscular dystrophy and it's getting worse over time, I'm about to reach the point where I won't be able to walk anymore. Are there any other kinds of chairs that I can use to get around in the house besides a traditional wheelchair? I already have a traditional wheelchair in storage (haven't used it yet) but my house has narrow hallways and such, I'm wondering if there is something more compact that I could sit in to move about the house? Maybe something like an office chair that is built for something like this? [deleted] I have one of these: https://www.travelscoot.com/ It does very well indoors (although I don't use it inside my house as I can still walk around there). I go into shops, offices, church etc with this and it does well. Small turning circle. I've had wheelchairs at other times in my life and may get one again soon as an alternative for bad days, but this is a good mid-stage compromise if you're not quite at a wheelchair stage yet. Expensive but worth it. I'm not sure of the name, but I see lots of people using the walker/chair combo. It's basically a 4 wheeled walker with a seat, so you can sit down if you get tired of walking. Is it a custom built one? Or a behemoth that doesnt even take you actual body width into account? I agree about needing to make your home accessible. You may be able to get financial help with this, contact your local Center for Independent Living for advice. Also, get that chair out of the closet and start driving it around a couple of hours a day. You'll probably realize it needs some tweaking, and it's a lot easier to do that when you're not completely dependent on it.
