Video: Accessibility fails in Russia  Sweet Jesus, that's awful. 

Anyone on this sub who lives there or has visited and can share their experiences? I wonder how frequent the accessibility problems are in Russia.  We live in the USA and I know of three places off the top of my head that don't offer accessibility just within 10 miles.   One is my son's old school which by the way has an entire wing dedicated to those with various special needs so quite a few wheelchair users (lack of ramps and vehicles constantly blocked handicap parking spots),  the county courthouse (only ramp is in a construction zone with danger signs posted everywhere) and a local compounding pharmacy (no ramps but they did have steps).   nice user name This one of yours? http://i.imgur.com/iudRopB.jpg DO NOT CLICK LINKS. GORE!!
