Old Invacare Repair/Tech experts? (TDX5, GB, TT-EX, Tarsys 2GTR) I've got a 2003 Invacare TDX5 with GB motors and Tarsys 2GTR seating. I'm keeping it alive, spare parts, rebuilding it. I'm having a few issues with motors and electronics, actuators, etc. Are there any old school experts on here I can connect with for advice/input? Msg me if so!
