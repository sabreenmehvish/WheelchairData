New user advice? I have fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and bad balance problems. I'm looking into getting an electric wheel chair. I've found two that I like the look of and I'm not sure what one to go for. One has 4 wheels and the other has 6. 

Is there much difference apart from the wheel number? I don't know if one of them is easier to maneuver for a new user or anything like that.

Thank you very much. Yes, there is a difference. But it mostly depends on the difference in the drive wheel. Rear wheel drive handles differently than, for example, middle wheel drive, which is probably what the 6 wheel chair has. Read more at this link:

You should try to test drive a rear wheel, mid wheel and front wheel drive chair to see which is best for you. [deleted] One thing to keep in mind is that power chairs should have internal settings that makes them drive differently. Things like setting the acceleration speed or turning speed or sensitivity of the joystick. If a chair feels like it drives funny but you like it otherwise, ask your dealer if they (or you - I'm the sort of person who wants to see the settings for myself! :P) can change these settings before making a decision.  Thank you very much! Thank you very much for the reply. I scheme I'd be getting it through will send a person to let me demo a few chairs, then I get to test a chair for 7 days before I decide if I like it or not.

Hopefully that will be long enough for me to figure out if it's good for me or not.
