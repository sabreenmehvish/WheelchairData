Travel to Japan My brother has a big wish to visit Japan. We have been informed that Kyoto is the place to visit.
We normally travel with Enable holidays as they check the hotels out and grade them on adaptability, supply disabled transfer and check hotels can supply special equipment. They do not go to Japan though.

We have looked at Virgin etc but the standard for help is not as good. Does anyone out there know of a good travel agency that can help us that cater well for people with disabilities? We live in the UK.

Many thanks [deleted] ill give it a try thx
