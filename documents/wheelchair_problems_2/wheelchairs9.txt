Kindhearted Walmart cashier paints a wheelchair-bound woman's nails after salon turned her away because her hands 'move too much' due to her cerebral palsy.  It’s completely fucked up that the viral focus of this story is “awww” instead of the nail salon’s appalling discrimination.  I'm sick of "abled person does good thing for disabled person" stories being fetishised to this extent. Yes the woman did a really nice thing. No it shouldn't be posted in r/aww.  The story should be "Ableist salon contravenes ADA".  This is totally inspiration porn Being disabled myself, I can’t get enough of these stories to counterbalance all the a*holes who treat us like 2nd rate citizens
