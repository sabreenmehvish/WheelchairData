Thank you for helping me decide on a chair! I posted a couple weeks ago about choosing between a used Quickie 2 or a new Nova and you all really helped me figure out what to do.

The Quickie 2 I was looking at sold before I could get it, but it was meant to be, because a few days ago I found a brand new "used" Quickie 2 for much cheaper ($200). It's in mint condition and fits my daughter really well!

Thank you! Quickies are nice. Parts are cheap and easy to find. I use stroller accessories if I need a cup holder or something.  Good to know about parts. Initially when I went to a wheelchair servicing place they said Quickie parts were  really expensive. I wasn't too worried about it, because this one is in new condition but I'm glad to hear they aren't necessarily right on that. I found third party sites. Quickie official, yes, going to be pricy. I got new larger casters, arm rests, tires, for pretty cheap. And the quality Is fine. Just have to be willing to search beyond official stuff.  Makes sense. Thanks! Got any specific sites you use? I’ve ordered from http://enableyourlife.com and been happy with them. I’m sure there’s others too.  Thanks for the link! I've ordered from one or two other places that had nice parts fiches, but this looks to be a bit cheaper.
