Getting a Quickie QRi, Feedback? I am limited between a Kimobility Tsunani and Quickie QRI due to insurance. I found positive result for the QRi and wanted your opinions. Qri is chill, I use it. They are very similar from the looks of them, but I've tried out the QRI and have a friend who uses one. Very solid, basic, all around a nice option.
