I totally get the fear for the cats safety, but there is a pretty simple solution, bring the wheelchair in and then say the wheelchair has to remain stationary. I mean, if the kid was in a huge power chair and crashing into things, then yeah, that would be justifiable, but flat out denial without any attempt to make a situation work is crushing.  What a shithole. Reading the comments on their Facebook page I kinda blame this parents to take the boy to that awful place. You can’t pet the cats? WTF   Exactly right!  Accommodate the visit. Seems easy enough to me. After looking at the cafe's Facebook page, it seems as though people with disabilities aren't the only potential customers being treated rudely. Some people should just not own businesses. If they don't get into hot water over this discrimination, the bad press will likely shut them down.
