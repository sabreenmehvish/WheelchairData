Disability Within Large Outdoor Music Events in the UK: A Case Study of Reading Festival. Hello everyone,

I'm currently attending the University of Brighton and was wondering if anyone one on here would be willing to answer some of my questions for my dissertation.

I'm researching into how people with a disability might experience live music events (such as festivals and concerts) - specifically Reading Festival.

If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me on here or my email: P.Radhakrishnan1@uni.brighton.ac.uk

Here is the link to the survey: https://goo.gl/forms/n4AXiouXc2t4L4Ds2

Thank you in advance! I havenâ€™t been to a festival since starting to use my wheelchair, and have not been to Reading Festival but would be very interested in the results of your study :)
