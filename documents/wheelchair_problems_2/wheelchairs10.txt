Anyone else dislike that companies post advertisements in r/wheelchairs ? While I enjoy actual wheelchair user's posting about products/services, the companies directly advertising here are like nails on a chalkboard to me. Was curious if I'm alone in this. They can be helpful, but they should have a special flair or make it obvious in the title, and they should be limited in number. Yes. Very. I wouldn’t mind so much if they were higher quality posts. If, for example, some manufacturer wanted to find here to share details and do an AMA is something, that would be great. But instead it’s just a bunch of spam garbage. I wonder if there’s an active mod here and if we can perhaps make a move to ban such posts... You're not alone.  Sorry, started a new job last month and I am getting ready for finals. I will make sure to keep up on removing and banning the spam better.
