Travelling to Victoria, BC - July/September Hi everyone,
I've already posted on /r/canada, /r/victoriabc and /r/britishcolumbia. I'm trying to find accessible accommodation in Victoria, BC from July to September this year. 

My one lead, AccessVictoria, have just let me know they have nothing available. 

Does anyone know any other options or any other people or associations I could contact?

Thanks in advance I don't know if you've gotten any answers yet, but you might check with the University of Victoria residences.  Try contacting the Disability Resource Centre, they may be able to help: www.drcvictoria.com

And perhaps this place:
