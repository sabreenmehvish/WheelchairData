WHEELCHAIR USERS WANTED FOR INTERVIEW Hi everybody! I am looking to interview powered wheelchair users for a study at the University of South Wales. I can arrange skype interviews, or if you are located in the South of Wales, I can meet you in person to be interviewed. If you are interested, please email me at leighrabbott@outlook.com Will you give us a few more details? What is the focus/goal? I'm in the US but I'd be happy to help if you could use me. Yes, of course. 
We are researching opinions about the features of your wheelchair and how you are using these as well as seeking information about how you are helping to prevent issues such as pressure ulcers and to manage your posture with/without any features that have been prescribed by a clinician. We are also interested in how you see yourself in comparison to other wheelchair users and what sort of friendship and social groups you consider yourself to be part of.  
I hope that makes sense. Please let me know if you would like any further information.  Oh great! Thank you! Do you use/previously used a powered wheelchair? ðŸ˜Š  Time commitment?  I too would be interested given a time commitment. Grad school is rather unforgiving in its distribution of free time D: Yes I have had many and have one right now It depends on how much details you would like to give, but I would say max 1 hour :)  I feel you! I would say max 1 hour :)  Okay. Could you email me please? We can schedule a date from there ðŸ˜Š Okay, I'm in. Okay, great! Thank you! If you could email me to schedule when you are free, that would be great!
