i love you all, but something that really bothers me... you guys are skipping leg days way too much. I decided it was easier to get rid of 'em I keep trying leg day, but my legs just flop everywhere.


WHAT AM I DOING WRONG, OP!? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even skip. i lost my legs yesterday dude give me a break... looks like you already got a (leg) break.

JK. We invite humor here. No offense intended to anyone. Sorry to hear about you loosing your legs. Hope you pain subsides quickly and your minds accepts your new body just as fast.Know that this place is full of experienced rollers, industry professionals and lots of newbs.  there is never an excuse not to squat. nobody likes chicken legs. i came to this subreddit for composure and this is the first thing i see... Composure or compassion?  I mean... it is kinda funny...
