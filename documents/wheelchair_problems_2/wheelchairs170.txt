Our Uncle built a race truck from scratch so he could fulfill his dream of finishing the Baja 500. He doing it all from a wheelchair, and we need your help to make it happen. Our uncle, Javier "Jav" Avila, runs his own construction business, designed his own house, and created his Off-Road racing truck from scratch. He has done all of this as a paraplegic, and we think it's a pretty amazing story. We are trying to make a documentary in the hopes that we can help Jav complete his life dream of finishing the Baja 500, and spread his story to others that might be inspired by someone who doesn't know the meaning of "adversity".

We're simply asking that people help us complete our mission by watching the trailer for the movie and if you're interested, pitch in $7 bucks to see the finished documentary, as well as get your name in the credits!

If nothing else, please spread the word. We feel like not enough people are aware that "disabled" doesn't mean you stop living. It just means you learn new ways to do it well.
