Dissertation: Disability and Live Music Experience Hello everyone,

I'm currently attending the University of Brighton and was wondering if anyone one on here would be willing to answer some of my questions for my dissertation.

I'm researching into how people with a disability might experience live music events (such as festivals and concerts) - specifically Reading Festival.

If anyone is interested please contact me on here or my email (provided below). I am open to answering any questions and explain the ins and outs of the research.

Thank you.
 For me any festival or lawn seating venue is a bust for me. For one everyone is always taller than me blocking my view when in the pit or having no stadium style seating.  Because of this I have to sit farther from the stage than I would like but Iâ€™d rather see the concert.  For outside/lawn, you gotta get there really early to have any hope of a spot were you can see the stage, normally right behind the muddiest shithole you can find where people won't stand. Once you're there, you're not moving till it's over, so pack a bag with anything you want to drink/eat. You better have a strong friend, cause that ground is going to turn to a bog.  
  
The upsides: Comfiest chair for miles. You can take a piss in place a lot more discretly than everyone else, and you don't have to stand in it or everyone elses' body fluids afterwords. Medical bags let you sneak a whole lot more goodies in at certain places. Dealers never think you're a cop.   
  
Most of all, I miss the freedom of roaming around while the action is going on. Echoing others who have mentioned GA/Standing Room only shows to be a total bust. Unless you want to risk being pushed around up front all night, you're not going to be seeing anything. I much prefer reserved seating. Sure I'm farther away than I'd like, but 9/10 times, I can actually see what's going on on the stage.
