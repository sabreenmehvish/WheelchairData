Wheelchair Photo shoot My friend is a amateur/hobbyist photographer and wants to do a photo shoot with me in my wheelchair. We both agree we want it to be unique and a little badass, but we have very few ideas on what to do - indoors vs outdoors, what positions, ect. Does anyone here have any ideas? Try looking at old pin up photos for positions and ideas!!! Dress up as a mermaid!!!
