Painting Your Wheelchair I was talking with my sister about how my next wheelchair needs to be orange and white (I'm a huge Star Wars fan), but I was complaining that I don't really need a new wheelchair for another 2-3 years. So she suggested we paint it. She works at a paint shop and claims if we the right primer, we could spray paint my titanium frame. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any experience with painting their wheelchair. Will it turn out like crap? Will it void the warranty in any way? I'm curious, since I'd like to paint a chair too.  What kind of paint shop does she work at?  Do you know what kind of paints she'd use?

I'm not sure if titanium needs special prep, otherwise I think it'd be strip old paint, sand/scuff, clean, etching primer, base, clear.  Ideally 2k clear.  Or avoid painting and do powder coat.

I think the two main things to worry about are peeling & durability.  

Good luck.  I might break out an old chair and try it out. Strip it and find someone to powder coat it. 
 TiLite recommends doing "touch-up" painting with Rustoleum

So, since they are telling you HOW to paint, I doubt it would void your warranty. But I would ask them before going ahead just to make sure. I would use plastidip. Comes off easily later, so you can change colors of you want. Shouldn't ruin anything either.
