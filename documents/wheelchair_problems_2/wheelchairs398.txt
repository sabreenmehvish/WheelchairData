Moderator here, back on the scene after months. Hello everyone, I apologize for being in-active for the past several  months. I was out of the country and had very limited web access. Since my return my computer crashed and I Just got it running this past week. I'm looking forward to seeing your posts and comments. 
I have scores of articles I want to put up here so be prepared for a barrage of posts. 

See you in cyber-space.
 Welcome back!
