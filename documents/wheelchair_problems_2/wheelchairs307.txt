Anyone use a Tankchair? These things look awesome for outdoors  Good for a day at the beach. looks super unpracatical, good luck getting that monster through a door I have longstanding fantasies about SOME kind of badass motorized beach chair. Tank chair, or off road Segway...something! But the fantasies always get derailed when I try to figure out how I would transport them to the beach. How in the world?? These things don’t even look like they’d fit on a big ol’ van wheelchair lift! Dude is apparently shady. If you want an actual working version, go with http://actiontrackchair.com instead Tank chairs are capable no doubt. but probably operator error, and possibly equipment failure would get me stuck out in the middle of nowhere... great point about doorways. i was going to bring up the huge pricetag...  My friend has one. It is not for indoor use at all. You have to trailer it to go places. It’s wildly impractical for a daily use situation, but highly practical on outdoor terrain.  I'm trying to figure out how on earth you can solo transfer into it. They don’t. You have to trailer them places. But it’s not insane to get in and out yourself so long as you can get it off the trailer. Source: friend has one.  In my case i would use it at the beach or in the woods. But i wouldn't be able to go get an ice cream at the beack for example. I can see it's use, but i think i'm just too used to my permobil chair You can do it. Lift up the footplate and pull right to the front.  I wonder too! These are like four feet wide so unless it’s a stand you’re not going inside. If you hunt or go to the beach often you never really have to worry about getting stuck, but on the off chance you do, good luck getting it out. They are super heavy.
