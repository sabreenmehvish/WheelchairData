What do you do when you're stranded? My power chair is not very durable and as such, I've had two incidents of getting completely stranded and three or so of thinking I was going to get stranded and inching my way home with a malfunctioning chair. I wonder though, what most people do when their equipment starts having problems. 

Same-day paratransit is highly unlikely even if the chair is still moving and there aren't accessible taxis or uberWAV in my town. I called up the fire department the first time (after trying to find an accessible taxi service I could ask for help) because I couldn't think of anyone else, and they called the cops, who got a truck and lifted it. The second time, I called the cops again and they did the same thing but I was reprimanded and told they wouldn't help a third time and I should use uber. I've been *extremely* anxious about what might happen if I get stuck again. So what do people normally do in this situation? I would have a local church's phone number. they may have a wheel chair access van. I would call and explain your situation to them and see if they have the means to help you out, if need be.
