Woman Paralyzed In Car Accident Creates Jeans For People In Wheelchairs  My favorite jean company went out of business but just announced they’re coming back. It’s hard to find good jeans that don’t irritate my pressure points. I’ll give this a look! Tommy Hilfiger has a special adaptive clothing line. However price is pretty much high and you won't have a chance to found this clothes in outlet store  This is an old article. Sorry I didn't look into their current status. It's an old article, but the company is still around, though they sadly have a very limited selection of jeans (like 1 style for women and 1 for men). I bought a pair back when they were doing the kickstarter and they are just  kinda okay. Definitely size up if you are between sizes (which I did not do so they were always super tight) and I found the hole in the crotch annoying as I don't need to cath (I was always hoping they'd come out with an option without the hole, but they never did).
