Thanks going out to National Seating and Mobility, Memphis Tennessee. Having a spare Permobil C 500 standing power chair is relief beyond measure. 

Powerchairs are very dependable, until the power module decides to go bad. $1,600

Medicaid won't pay for us to maintain a spare Powerchair, Federal  BC/BS won't either.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH NATIONAL SEATING for sending us a used power module. 

I installed it and breathed a sigh of relief, one less thing to have to be concerned with in an already stressful life.
