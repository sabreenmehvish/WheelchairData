Powerchair maintenance suggestions? I've had my first chair, a Pride Quantum 600 for 5 years and need to do maintenance on it. A handy friend will help, to save the cost of a service center. 
I'm thinking to get new brushes for the motors, new batteries (looking at MightyMaxBattery ML55-12MP2?) and checking the wiring as the tilt function sometimes get stuck until cables are prodded.

Is there anything else we need to be aware of or check? Any parts need lube? Bearings? Tilt mechanism? I need this chair to live forever... Skip the mighty max batteries. If you are going to pay out of pocket, go right for the best. MK battey M22NF SLD G, 2 of them. There is a reason that I sell only MKs. 

Also,   NEVER USE GREASE OR WD-40.  They both will ruin chairs. Only use dry lubricants like PTFE or dry moly.  Any brass parts on your tilt system could use looking at and lubing. Pride (Quantum parent company) uses brass specifically because it will wear before the steel does. It never hurts to help the brass love longer by reducing friction. If they look deformed (anything other than round) replace them. 

Check the connections on ALL of your wiring. Most can handle a little dielectric grease to help keep out moisture. Just use tiny amounts. Less than what you think you would need. 

Changing the brushes should be fine. While you have them out, spray a little electronics cleaner in. Do not try to use compressed air. Just spray a little cleaner and let it dry. 

Last note, in the US you can get a new chair every 5 years through insurance, why are you not doing that and keeping your 600 as a back up?  Don't forget to take care of the cushion! Depending on what typw you have, this may be increasingly important. Cushions are often overlooked but need to be kept clean and well-maintained to last as long as possible :) Great Idea !!! Have you started to use Loctite Blue 242 ? Use it liberally. It will save you losing screws on long street trips.
Also look at replacing the bearings and lube in the motors, as well as a hard look at the non-drive wheels for breaks, chunks missing and so forth. 
I have a Quantum 600 also, with the "big" chair. Drive Safe ! I'm a Dane living in Vancouver, my 6 yr old son was born here so I won't leave. I get "early disability pension" from Denmark, which is better than Canadian but they don't pay for medical supplies. 

In Canada you get get supplies covered but only if on Canadian disability, so I get nothing because I can't get Canadian disability when on Danish disability (and they know). This also means I can't get things like transport passes, etc. all the disability stuff...

So, when chair dies I'm in dire straits... I don't have a backup power/manual. I need it to live long and buy parts cheap in the US. Ok, I see MK mentioned a lot, so got a local quote for MK GEL here in Vancouver, CAD$421.88 (==335.81USD) for a set of two. I was researching motors on EBay. I was wondering do you know if 4-pole motors are a drop in replacement for 2-pole? They have a small yellow handle/knob at the back, I was wondering if that's the clutch. My motors don't have that but instead a large handle on the side, for clutch. So that made me wonder about compatibility... Thank you! One of my front wheels popped off once on that account..

Do you use GEL or AGM batteries?  Ouch. Are there any local groups that would refurbish and sell chairs cheap?   I live in Utah and here we have CREATE that will sell chairs at cost of refurbishment or charities like B in Motion for those will no insurance and low income.   

And your other reply mentioned the cost of MKs. That is a normal price from a medical supply store.   Don't forget to check regular battery companies too.  Here we have a Batteries Plus franchise that carries MKs for a lower price than what I can sell them for.  They sound like they are not compatible. The four pole are the modern set up.   Unfortunately the electronics are different so they might fit but the brains of your chair won't run them correctly. 

The yellow handle on the 4 pole is a brake release. Clutch release levers go directly into the gear box.  Any time you have to replace those be prepared to cuss.  I was issued (by the VA) the AGM (Glass Mat) Batteries. Because of the "contract" I **must** let the Durable Medical Goods supplier change them out. If I was to *choose*, I would go for a duplex solution with 2 AGM batteries. You can expect to pay between $120 and $150 *each*, but they do last a long time.
Also, remember **ABC**
Always Be Charging, that 5 mins. of "top-off" will be helpful time and time again. Denmark and Canada; two countries with excellent healthcare and social care systems and I expertly manage to fall in the only crack. I could probably take a drive in a 9,000,000 kmÂ² desert and hit the only tree.

I'll look for alternative channels, have also sent query to MK Battery for online or brick retail locations in BC. Hey! Checking in to see how you made out? If you need anything for your power chair shoot me a message and I can look up part numbers and pricing. I am a tech in SK however I can set you up with a contact in Vancouver to order parts through if you like. 

I hope you went with the MK batteries, there's nothing that can compete with their quality. 

Everything the other guy said was spot on! 

Depending on your income the Kinsmen foundation might be able to work something out for a new power chair. It might be worth looking into however all maintenance and repairs would still be on your dime.  Hiya, I got a pair of Mk batteries installed from the local powerchair shop. However they were unbalanced so for weeks they were performing poorly and showing unreliable level until I got them balanced properly. They're OK now, though seem a bit weaker than the old ones when they were new. Next time I'd like to buy them myself and have a friend put them in, if I can find a place to buy them. A contact for batteries or parts might come in handy in the future, I had armrests shipped from US last year...

Odd thing, the invoice shows "8G22NF GEL 50.6 Amp", whereas the ones I looked up online were 55Amp. I had a friend look in my chair - they're grey and have  a Mk Battery sticker on the side.
My friend also put in a 24v to 5v USB charger. It's great to charge my phone when out ;)
