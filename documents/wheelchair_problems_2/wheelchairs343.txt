Getting a new chair when insurance rolls over? I've been covered by a private HMO (through a parent) as my primary insurance and Medi-Cal as my secondary for about a year now. I received a power chair in June, covered at 100% through my primary, but it's pretty low-quality and keeps needing extensive repairs every few months that take me out of my daily life. I just turned 26 and in a month Medi-Cal will be my only insurance.

I know Medicaid only does wheelchairs every five years, but if they've never covered a wheelchair themselves, will they cover another, different one? Or will they start counting from when my current primary covered one? Insurance switch glitch.  If medi-cal did not pay for any part of your current chair or any repairs, they will cover a new one.

Oddly enough the steps to get a new insurance to recognise a old chair are the exact same to get a new chair so I advise people to just get a new one.  I'm in a similar pickle. My chair is breaking down constantly and the answer I get is they will help you get a new one only when the cost of repairs exceeds the cost of a new chair. I'm in MD tho. thank god.
