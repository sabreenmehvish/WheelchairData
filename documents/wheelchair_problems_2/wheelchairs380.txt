Push to lock brake problem, any help in solving? I have recently had to replace my brakes for my wheelchair. However my new breaks flip up too easily. They are great when they are on but when transferring they are coming off far to easily. Is there a way to strengthen the brake so it doesn't flip back off at the slightest knock? 

They are similar to these http://www.epc-wheelchairs.co.uk/image/cache/catalog/EPC%20Images/Products/kuschall-high-mount-push-to-lock-brake,-left-875x1000.JPG [deleted] My wife had similar on one of her chairs...had to play with the 3 bolts on the brake to find the correct distance and pressure.  Took a while to find the perfect spot and tightness, but eventually did and they work great. The other posts are accurate but they are forgetting one part, lightly tighten the bolts that go from the mounting bat to the brake itself. If they are lose your brake will snap back easily.  Yea there inflatable, I will look into moving the breaks a bit more cheers.  Thanks for that will do try that in a moment
