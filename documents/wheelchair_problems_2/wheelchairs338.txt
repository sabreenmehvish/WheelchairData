Share your experiences receiving and using assistive devices/equipment of all types. (research survey : approved by mods) I'm part of a group researching ways to improve the ways folks get their assistive devices/equipment. Would greatly appreciate your input.

Ever used assistive or adaptive equipment/devices? Let your voice be heard. Wheelchairs and mobility aides of all types absolutely included.

Researchers affiliated with the City University of New York would love to hear what you think about your equipment experiences and how providers can make your experience better. What role would you like to play in the process?

Anonymous participation is OK unless you'd like to be considered for additional questions/a paid interview in the future. Survey has been cleared by the City University of NY Graduate Center IRB.

Happy to answer any and all questions about the project. Many thanks for your help.

Please share with anyone you think has thoughtful things to say about their experiences receiving equipment over the years. No adaptation too small. Thank you!
 Great feedback. Please keep it coming. Thanks again. :) Survey still open. Not too late to contribute your experiences with adaptive devices. So many wonderful responses thus far.
