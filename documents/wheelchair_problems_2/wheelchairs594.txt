I'm considering off road tires for my wheelchair and came across this enlightening post. Any more tips?  I always prefer to start newer users with a medium v-trak tire. Aggressive enough to get through most terrain (usually all with experience) but not so aggressive that it eats hands, tracks mud/snow inside, and makes lots of noise. I preferred to try and keep tires to the same size as a slight change has a huge difference in handling and feel of the chair. I would like to my favorites but I can't from mobile.  I started with a set of normal tires then switched to big knobbys after a year or so.  In my opinion the only thing they are good for is jacking your arms up a little bit lol.  Dont get me wrong there is a difference but its not much of one.  And they are messy.  The more tread on the tire the bigger mess you leave behind.  I started using regular mountain bike tires.  They are more of an all terrain type tread and kind of give the user the best of both worlds.  Hope this helps. Regular casters or do you use something else?  The bigger the casters the better for off roading.  Usually what holds you back while off roading is your front casters getting stuck on every little rock/bump/grass.  Its hard to have the best of both worlds when talking about on/off roading in a wheelchair without making a ton of adjustments to your chair.  I found a device called a FreeWheel.  It is a larger wheel that clamps onto your foot plate that picks your front wheels off the ground giving you tons of freedom while off roading.  The best part is it takes about 10 seconds to put on and take off so you get the best of both worlds without having to make a ton of adjustments....check it out its awesome. Yeah I've actually got one, it gets the job done most of the time
