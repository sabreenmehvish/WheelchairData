If you have a moment, please take this 1-minute long survey about mobility devices! More details in the comments.  I am a grad student that is evaluating the market potential for a robotic device that is worn on the outside of the legs.  The device provides support for individuals who would normally use a wheelchair (parplegics, individuals with muscular diseases, broken bones, etc.).  The device is actually able to "walk," even in the case of parplegic individuals.  This is a very exciting invention, which will most likely be more prominent in the next few years.

We are conducting this survey to better understand the mindset of individuals who use wheelchairs. I think you should consider adding a comment section to your survey for those that state "no" when you ask if they'd use an exoskeleton over a wheelchair.

There are many, many disabilities where exoskeletons in their current form just cannot viably replace a wheelchair. (For some disabilities, an exoskeleton will *never* be viable, regardless of future improvements). It could be helpful though for you to understand the reasons that people would refuse an exoskeleton and stick with a chair. 

It may even allow you to come up with some amazing new technology that removes the barriers some people currently face when considering an exoskeleton over a wheelchair.

I was going to take your survey but having looked at it, I don't think my answers would be of any use to you as exoskeletons just wouldn't work for me. Thank you for your input.

You are correct, the survey should have a section for comments.  This was an oversight due to our inexperience.
