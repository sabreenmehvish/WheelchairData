Fundraising? Can anyone recommend a better way to fundraise for a new wheelchair? 

My cousins wheelchair was stolen again for a second time, and he is currently on go fund me with little result, he needs a custom fit wheelchair which is quite expensive 

Any suggestions would be appreciated, he's in the uk if that makes a difference  youcaring.com is another good fundraising site that deals mostly (from what I've seen on there) with medical expenses. That's really awful that your cousin has had two wheelchairs stolen. I can't imagine how anyone could bring themselves to do something that terrible. 


Not saying you or your cousin was at fault, but have you looked into ways to secure the chair? I know how expensive the custom ones are, I've looked into them myself, so it might be a good idea to find some sort of wheel lock to prevent it from being taken as well. Yes he has, with his disability it's hard for him to put it in the trunk of his car, so they are going to start to bolt it to the wall.... He has lived there for almost three years and never had an issue, he usually leaves it behind the gate when he drops his son off at grandmas or preschool, but two chairs in a span of a few months is just horrible.... 

Thanks I'll look into that as well, he's raising money for a new chair as well as security system
