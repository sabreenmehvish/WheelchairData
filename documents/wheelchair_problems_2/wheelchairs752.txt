How do I stop my family to abuse my blue parking placard??? This is a prevalent problem nationwide.  It's **your** placard. Keep it with you if you're not in the vehicle. Report them if they take it off you and use it. 

It's really simple. If you don't have the guts to stick up for your own rights and those of other disabled people, who will? Tell them to obey the law and stop being scumbags.  If you drive and have your own vehicle, get disabled plates and ditch the hangtag. 
I like the "keep the placard on person" idea best
I do have plates on my vehicle...the placard is the issue Take it and lock it your car? Tell your family to stop being shitheads.  Smash their lower spine with a hammer, problemo solvo! One gimp in a family is enough.  Hahaha, good one ðŸ˜„
