Emergency contact information and short diagnostic summary on wheelchair? I have a 10 year old with multiple medical issues and functions as a toddler mentally.   I  have completed a 2 page emergency form for the glove compartment of our car for him and am thinking I should include a copy on his wheelchair as well in case of accident on the way to school.  He has significant sensory issues so I am wary of using a medical bracelet.  I am told the shoe medical tags are often overlooked in a real emergency.  Is there someway I could attach a bright orange pouch to his chair that he can't reach but would still be visible to emergency crews?   Hmm...  thinking I should find a way to attach to his car seat also.    I actually don't know what the standard way of handling a concern like yours is, but I would getÂ him a survival/tactical first aid kit. They're designed to fit on plate carriers (like body armor, things you see soldierrs wearing), so they usually have velcro on them, and can be a bright, catchy red. Any decent first responder will see that, and most likely check it. You can have his info on a card inside, or in an ID slot if it has one. 

Something like [this](http://www.shop.skinnymedic.com/Red-First-Aid-Medical-Kit-MOLLE-Pouch-redsmall.htm), attached to the back of his chair with simple velcro would be sturdy, and you could even put a big medic cross patch on the front of it to make sure they see. What about something like a bright orange luggage tag attached to the handle (or another visible place)? You could write something like MEDICAL INFO on one side and put the papers within and write the basic info on a card. You could also attach one to his car seat.   I think something like [this](http://www.bdmleather.com.au/pvc/DOCUMENT-POUCH) with the back velcroed up might work, water proof, high visibility
