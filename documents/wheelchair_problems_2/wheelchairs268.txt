Adventure Group Travel for Wheelchair Users Hello r/wheelchairs!  As an experienced Tour Leader, I’d like to put together adventure tours that include (but aren’t exclusive to) people that use wheelchairs.  Your honest input would be much appreciated and extremely helpful in creating fun and exciting trips for everyone.

**Would you consider Group Travel thru the USA as an option for your next vacation?**  
**Your ideal trip:**  
* What are some places you’d like to visit?  
* How many days/weeks would it be?  
* What activities would you like to do? (Whitewater rafting, zip lining, skydiving, ATVs, go carts, live music, etc.)  
* Considering the price difference, would you prefer camping or budget lodging? (Note: lodging would be roughly $40/day more.)  
**What would be a fair price that you’d be willing to pay for this ideal trip of yours?**  
**Would you prefer to travel alone or take friends?**  
**Seating:**  
* Do you prefer standard seating or wheelchair spots?  
* Would you be willing to use standard seating?  
**Can you think of any additional necessary accommodations other than what is listed below?**  
* All activities must accommodate.  
* All lodging must accommodate.  
* Accessible bathroom stops along route.  
* Must assist with wheelchairs while loading and unloading the vehicle.  
* Must help with luggage.  
**What resources and forums would be helpful for research?**  
**What’s the best way for letting people know when these trips are available?**  

Thanks to everyone in advance for your input! Here is one consideration that most tour groups don't think of.   Before you travel, contact local wheelchair companies to make sure they can do repairs or rent chairs in the event of a breakdown. 

I used to live in a major tourist area and would get calls for repairs all the time. I would do what I could but was not able to take care of everyone.  I would say that should be true for all medical equipment and rx's.   I can't tell you how many times a parent comes on one of the groups to beg a local parent to let them borrow something because there's broke or was left behind.   I know of one Mom who traveled to India and her child's enteral pump broke.   According to her they couldn't find a replacement and had to convert all the child's feed sets to gravity bags.

To be honest, I rarely travel because the stress is so much that vacation feels more like torture although to be fair my son is technology dependent so there are severe consequences if something doesn't go right.   

If you are in better health I would suggest just making back up plans for the wheelchair, If you are dependent on a bunch of equipment and/or medicine plan carefully and run through contingency plans for every worse case scenario and make lists and triple check them, Once before packing to make sure everything is listed, once after packing to make sure everything got packed and once when you load the car to confirm everything made it into your vehicle.
