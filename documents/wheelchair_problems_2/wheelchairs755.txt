I'm a relatively new wheelchair user and need advice on UK funding Needing advice on funding for sports chairs mainly, but I need to find a custom everyday chair too due to my skewed proportions (Ehlers Danlos Arthrochalasia type). Being pointed in the right direction would be much appreciated, thanks. The NHS only supply basic models but if you wish for something more specialised there is a voucher scheme available, info [here](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/social-care-services/Pages/nhs-wheelchair-services.aspx) Yep, applied for NHS funding, but as I can still walk (albeit extremely badly) for very short distances my local CCG don't class me as a full time user despite the fact that without one I cannot even leave the house.

edit: I already have a kuschall airlite on loan from a friend, which I love but can't keep for much longer. Or the train tracks are a call in' wooo wooo! what? Lol What's wrong? Is that a reference? If so, what to? Think op means you should roll out onto the train tracks. Don't shoot the messenger. well isn't that just charming eh? No this is charm. http://m.newsfilter.org/58965
