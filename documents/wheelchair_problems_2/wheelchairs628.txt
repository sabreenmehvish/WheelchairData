Survey for Capstone project Hi everyone. I posted a link to a survey my group is doing for our Capstone project. This is purely for educational purposes only. Any of you who can go through these questions will be great. It should only take a couple  minutes to complete. Appreciated.

 r/https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NXWWJ39  I got stuck on the electric question and closed the tab because it wouldnâ€™t get past that without an answer. If you want people to take your survey you should make sure you don't make optional questions mandatory.  Thank you everyone for commenting. I let the creator of the survey know. Everything should now be fixed.  Done
