hey there sports fans on wheels! your input would be greatly appreciated. hey all, new reddit user here. I'm a designer working on a project with an arena in Boston to help improve the wheelchair user's experience of attending a live sporting event. These questions are for any wheelchair users anywhere (not just in Boston or the US): if you attend live games regularly, what are some problems you face and what frustrates you most about the experience? and if you don't attend games regularly (but have an interest), what is it that's keeping you from doing so?
Thanks in advance for your help!!! One problem that I have with my wife, she is quadriplegic and in a powerchair...the wheelchair accessible seats in our local arena are at the top of the main concourse, looking down on rows A-V to the main floor.  This is actually a pretty decent setup...until the arena starts hanging banners on the railing in front of the wheelchair rows.  My wife can't get close enough to see complete over the banner, so now about a quarter of the floor area is partially blocked.
Here is the arena, note the folding chairs and rails in the bottom corners...these are the rails that they hang banners on (sometimes the arena, sometimes the local sports team).  It can be pretty annoying for her.

 I'm quadriplegic too & what I hate at sportevents is that we aren't around "normal people". [like here!](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PVsgqPyZ-W8/S3AzlouPsWI/AAAAAAAAZr0/QhyCkCxeu1A/s400/Cape+Town+Stadium+wheelchair+access.jpg) I'd love to be surrounded & be part of the euphoria or sadness with others when we win or lose! Are you still after more feedback?
