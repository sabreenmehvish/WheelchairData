Whill Ci Test Drive Report I had the chance to spend four days trying out the new-in-2018 Whill Ci "ultra-portable personal electric vehicle." The manufacturer is not seeking FDA approval, so in the U.S., it's not a "power wheelchair." It is a customizable seat atop four wheels controlled by a joystick. A lithium-ion battery powers the two rear-wheel drive motors. 

[Whill Model Ci is a sleek, Z-form-factor device with padded seat & back cushions. The center of the Z is formed from left and right side seating supports, rising from the back wheel to the front of the seat at a 45° angle. The base of the Z connects the front and drive wheels. Triangular arms that adjust on the support members form the top of the Z.](https://mltshp-cdn.com/r/1DCJM)

This is the Japanese company Whill's third version of "let's reinvent the power wheelchair." [More at their site about two other devices: the it’s-actually-FDA-approved Model M power wheelchair and the initial Model A “personal mobility device.”](http://whill.us) All of them have won design awards, and it's clear they've consulted with actual wheelchair users in some of the excellent details.

##### Quick Specs

* 115 lbs with Li-Ion battery
* Disassembles into three parts
* 10.5 in rear wheel drive with two motors
* Joystick control on one side. On/off, speed, horn, battery charge display on other.
* 9.8 in front omni wheels replace casters
* large fold-up footplate
* available now $4000; arrange test drive at site
* 2.5in ground clearance, 30in turning radius *with footplate*
* [User Manual](go.whill.us/ModelCiUserManual)

##### Nifty Things

* Nice build quality. Metal where it counts, high-quality plastic elsewhere
* Truly portable. The three parts stand on their own. The heaviest is 43 lbs. 
* Omni wheels are mind-blowing. They roll **sideways**, unlike casters that spin on a swivel. Omni wheels increase maneuverability almost to the level of a center-wheel drive chair. For those of us die-hard rear-wheel drivers, it eliminates realigning casters (when you need to back up to go forward).
* Front wheel fenders form side walls for feet to rest against, minimizing effort to keep feet on footplate
* Entire arm rest assembly swivels back to permit access to tables
* Useful adjustability if you're an average person under 250lbs: more than a basic Medicare chair, less than a rehab chair, see the full details on their site. 
* Claimed maximum incline is 10°. I was able to motor it up 8 ft folding ramps into back of minivan (at least 30°), although the chair complained verbally! "caution: outside specifications"
* Handled well on cross slope
* Solid seat pan for my Roho cushion
* Handled uneven ground well, including (dead) grass, cracked sidewalks and screened gravel.

[Hexagonal omni wheel comprises six pairs of spool-like resilient wheels. Six smaller spools nestle between each set of larger ones. All these wheels spin perpendicular to path of travel. Each spool has six contact surfaces: one thick outer ring and two thinner rings bridging a metal spoke.](https://mltshp-cdn.com/r/1DCJD)

##### Things I Didn't Like

* Max speed 5.0 mph
* Non-proportional joystick
* Not truly programmable: they offer 3 profiles (slow, medium, fast) and four speeds within each profile. Can't adjust for tremors, can't set acceleration/deceleration or torque
* Rear wheels are narrow and rigid
* Single seat post, like a scooter
* Operating temp 5° to 104°. Not great for a Wisconsin winter.
* Swivel-back armrests mean that the joystick/power controls out of reach. Getting under a table is tricky: swivel back power side armrest, then maneuver that side under table, then release joystick side and swivel up just enough to get joystick over table and you under table, then finally swivel joystick all the way back.
* Not crash-tested, so doesn't have "WC19" transit tie-downs. There *are* integral loops in back frame, but an "accessory bar" with no loops under front seat. (I guess they eliminated front loops to avoid liability issues.) You could definitely attach tether straps to front accessory bar
* Slid backwards on sheet ice when attempting to go up a shallow incline. (Didn't happen with my current chair because it's at least 100lbs heavier, with wider tires.)
* Problems rolling over grooved surfaces. Could be because the narrow ridges of the omni wheel roller fits into the groove, so that the rest of the wheel had to skew against this micro barrier. Happened inside on floor with large tiles--slightly lower mortar channels grabbed the wheel and I had to fight it. More problematic when exiting the bus turning right from anti slip flooring over the low metal threshold of the bus ramp. I coped, but it was surprising and annoying. 

##### Wow, Intriguing.

* Professor Xavier esthetic
* Omni wheels
* Spoken alerts
* No push handles, but easy to put in neutral and can push metal back
* Metal back neatly holds any tote bag with more than 20" drop
* Under-seat box for your stuff
* Peep hole in seat pan to simplify installing seating assembly back on seat post
* USB port to charge your phone
* Charging port is on the lightweight battery--under 7 lbs. Can grab battery handle to bring battery inside to charge and leave the rest in the car
* iOS app communicates with controller via Bluetooth. You can choose among three profiles; see battery status and odometer. App also has a virtual joystick, so you can drive the chair when you're not sitting in it
* Electronic lock, using app or keyfob
* Very low profile, palm size joystick is easy to operate and is not a toddler magnet

##### Final Thoughts

* I am the target market: part-time wheelchair user, likes Apple products & appreciates nifty design, needs a joystick not a scooter with tiller
* if I had to pay out of pocket, this $4000 would be better than a comparable basic chair
* Whill's doing good marketing: you can rent it via Scootaround, buy it online on many DME sites (Spinlife, 1800Wheelchair), or test drive from National Seating and Mobility, which is all about customizing high-end seating and meeting individual needs
* My trial came from NSM, and they said they could get an 18" back on it, which I'd need
 Hey, cool product review! Thanks! I’d never encountered that product, and your review was really helpful.

Interesting step for them to avoid FDA approval. I hope they succeed for that reason alone, because I’d love too see that emerge as a viable economic slot. More affordable, less bulky safety additions. Especially like the way they have an approved counterpart—more options all around! We have the same experience when the Ci is traversing grooves, even including grooves between concrete slabs in sidewalks. We have also had instances of sudden sideways skidding when the Ci is being driven down wet and sloped sidewalks or roads. Hopefully, Whill engineers will  address these issues. I saw the Whill folks in person last month when I went to the Abilities Expo near Chicago, and I spoke with one of the engineers about this behavior. He sounded surprised, which is disappointing. I'd messaged them about it already.  


It was the dealbreaker for me re: purchasing the Whill. I do hope they improve it!
