Wheelchair accessible app My name is AJ. My team and I are currently in the process of developing an android application for our AP CS class. The idea is making an app for people in wheelchairs find the closest wheelchair ramp using google maps. We have a base idea but need help with more suggestions, any response is appreciated! https://goo.gl/forms/34oDph4qrloP6C3R2 Having which buildings have ramps would be good.  Often you get to one that is supposedly flat and it has one step.  Curbs too, you'd be surprised how many footpaths have a step down.  An overall suggestion could be to make a wheelchair accessible directions, google maps unfortunately will tell you the quickest way to your destination - but makes no mention of whether it is accessible.   Good luck! Try posting over in r/disability too for more response. This isn't a super active sub unfortunately. I do wheelchair accessible taxi service and this would be good for our business... e.g. knowing where to drop someone off at a building I'm interested in this, but I'm not sure what you mean by a 'wheelchair ramp'. Does this include all the dropped curbs/kerbs? What about buildings that have a level entry and therefore don't need ramps? 

As others have said, it would be truly useful to know how to get in to buildings, and where dropped curbs are (although there are thousands per city), and also to know which buildings I can't get into due to there being steps at all entrances.
