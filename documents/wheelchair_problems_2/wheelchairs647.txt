Going to be in a wheelchair for a week due to surgery, any crash courses? I am undergoing orthopedic surgery on both of my meniscuses and will be in a wheelchair for a few days to a little over a week after it due to the combination of swelling and weakness. You’ll no longer be at eye level so people will not see you. They will walk right in front of you, even climb over you in busy places. Elevators are the worst be prepared for them to cram in and you will have butts and crotches in your face. You’ll have to call ahead and see if the places you want to go are accessible. I feel like there should be more, but I’m tired and nothing’s coming to me right now. Good luck with the surgeries.

It will help you find accessible places I may be too late, but if you haven't had the surgery yet, something you should know is that cars will absolutely not see you. It sounds weird I know, but you have to imagine you're actually invisible when crossing streets and plan accordingly.  [deleted] I see where you're coming from. Yes that will be a big change for you. I’m sure short people ask you to get things from up high all the time, now’s your chance to reverse that. Think of some friends that have done that to you. Or the good old “how’s the weather up there”, you can throw that back to anyone who’s done it to you. 15 is young for double meniscus surgery, I hope they find the cause too so you can prevent further damage.  Your user name fits.
