Hi! I am part of an Senior Engineering team working on developing an electric wheel chair that is up to date with modern technology. The wheel chair will utilize the type of motors that are found in the electric skateboards and street scooters. WE NEED YOUR HELP! For our project we want information and opinions directly from real life users to improve our designs and perspectives.

If you are interested in helping us please fill out this short survey!


[Survey Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbZv0zsYLE5wf3LMoOgPbg-kwlbJXOsXhsbRTK5dg7f5RieQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)  I would like to wheelchair over rough terrain. The wheels would be square with a rubber belt rolling over the square. When the wheel falls into a hole, or encounters an obstacle, the track would stop rolling and the power transferred to the wheel’s driving axle, the square wheel would then flop over. The proportion of track/axle torque would be electronically controlled. I’ve completed the survey, but it might be helpful if you were to provide more information about the design. It’s impossible to judge a product I know virtually nothing about. I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/disability] [Please help us design a better electric wheelchair by filling out this quick survey! Any information helps!](https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/9dcmoz/please_help_us_design_a_better_electric/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* Done! All filled out and happy to help! My brother uses a pushable wheelchair and we've had powered ones before, but the battery never lasts and they never included a spare!

A second battery that you can charge up when the other is in it use.

I would also say it needs to be hardy. If a wheelchair breaks or needs repaired, it's more than an annoyance, it means my brother is stuck in bed until it's repaired. I'm not sure how expensive it is in countries where you pay for healthcare, but I bet it's not cheap. It needs to be lightweight so it can easily be taken out of a car trunk. Do scooter/skateboard motors actually have enough power and particularly torque to propel a wheelchair? Starting from zero on a steep uphill slope takes a lot of power and keep in mind that a wheelchair plus user can weigh substantially more than a kid on a scooter. Thank you for the input! If you haven't already, we greatly appreciate any more information shared through the google survey! Thank you Lilac!
