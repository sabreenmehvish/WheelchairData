Wheelchair/Assistance Survey (Everyone) Hello, we are a team of seniors from Jamesville-Dewitt High School in New York, and are working on solving difficulties that wheelchair users face daily. We would appreciate any response to our survey so we may gather data and gain direction towards a suitable solution. Thank you for your help.

 Honestly I didn't finish the survey. You need to narrow the scope of the last two questions into maybe 10-15 multiple choice plus one "anything you'd like to add".
