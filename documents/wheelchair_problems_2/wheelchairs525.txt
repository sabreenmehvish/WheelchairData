An Odd Request, Hope You Can Help! =] Hi guys!

First off, just wanted to introduce myself and as to why I'm posting in your sub. I'm a 3D artist and have been tasked with making a wheelchair, specifically an active wheelchair, so before I begin bashing away at making a wheelchair I'd like some decent source material. I'm not a wheelchair user and don't know anybody who actually has one or uses one themselves and there is only so much Google can do.

So, I'm here to ask you lot if you could share with me any images of your own wheelchairs, active or not. I want to be able to see where the chair gets most of its wear and tear. Also I would like to know the basic structure of an active wheelchair. THey seem to be a bit more complex in their build in opposition to your standard wheelchair.

If any of you guys can help it would greatly appreciated!

Cheers guys! I don't use a manual chair, but from what I've read here, http://www.tilite.com/ is a very popular brand/style. I have a TiLite ZRA - from my experiences around here, it's a fairly common manual chair. http://www.tilite.com/chairs_zra.php

Here's a image of mine (from an photo project my friend and I did, so I'd prefer it not to be around the internet, so I will take it off imgur in a few days, so save it if you want it for the future) http://imgur.com/a/GbURo you can see plenty of scuffmarks on the handrims, where most of the wear and tear is.  3D artist as in drawings or 3D printing? Thank you for the link =] This is great! Thank you! Yeah, if it's ok I'd like to save the image as reference.

Cheers for the help =] As in 3D artist for games =] Yeah, go ahead and save it. Tell me when you have so I can take it down.  Hey there,!

Sorry I've only just seen your message! I have saved it, thank you again!
