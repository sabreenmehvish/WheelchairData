Comfortable wheel chairs? So 8mo ago i became unable to walk due to a back surgery gone wrong. I lost alot of sensation throughout my body. But not enough for my back to stop hurting ðŸ˜€

Avoiding a long story, these "hammoc" seats destroy my back, ive tried every cushion in the world. Do they make more supportive wheelchairs that are more like a seat? Csn anyone provide links? Ive looked on amazon but csnt find what im looking for. Many chairs have an available option of a "solid seat pan", usually a plate of sturdy aluminum, steel, or carbon fiber. I know for my chair they run around $300 out of pocket, [here's an example of one](https://www.southwestmedical.com/replacement-parts/tilite/tilite-zra/upholstery/seat-slings/solid-seat-pan/solid-seat-pan-aluminum).

I also suspect a solid back would help out, but that's a question for your whoever does your chair assessment. sorry for the botched surgery. have you heard of roho air cushions? you can pump up the cushion to firm or soft feel as you choose. 

if you are expecting to use a wheelchair to move around the house, you may consider a custom frame. you will need to contact a local seating professional (ATP) in your area as custom wheelchairs fall under medical devices and you will need a prescription to get one. Be forewarned, they can get expensive, but will guaranteed get you comfortable. 
custom backs, both contoured and body hugging are available as well.  Yes, my son had fusion surgery a year ago that left him in a lot of pain.   The DME made him a custom molded seat (his spine still isn't fully straight) designed to prevent skin breakdown and it is super comfortable.    He has a ZRA Tilite.   Insurance covered it all but we had medical documentation about the complications of just using a foam seat caused.    His wheelchair back cushion.

His bottom wheelchair bottom cushion  [https://www.shopwheelchair.com/p-invacare-matrx-ps-cushion.html?msclkid=71bfac15a7e81b00ce62f7044764a5cd&utm\_source=bing&utm\_medium=cpc&utm\_campaign=Wheelchair%20Cushions%20Shopping%20new&utm\_term=4579328490984269&utm\_content=Invacare%20Cushions](https://www.shopwheelchair.com/p-invacare-matrx-ps-cushion.html?msclkid=71bfac15a7e81b00ce62f7044764a5cd&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Wheelchair%20Cushions%20Shopping%20new&utm_term=4579328490984269&utm_content=Invacare%20Cushions)

Admittedly insurance cheeped out quite a bit on the bottom cushion but we didn't have the medical justification to warrant a more expensive bottom cushion because all his documented wound care issues were on his back not his bottom but they did a least upgrade from a crappier version due to the risk of skin breakdown.   If you pay out of pocket then you can bypass the whole insurance game where you have to justify everything.

Just a warning when you go to custom seating it does block your ability to fold up the wheelchair frame for travel.    Unfortunately the more support you need the heavier and bulkier things get so there are trade offs beyond just price.    My son is still in a lot of pain and the major cause seems to be from having to sit upright putting too much pressure on his lower spine and rods.   Due to this we may eventually have to switch over to a power chair with tilt in space seating and at that point we will have to have a larger vehicle with some type of lift since these chairs are bulky and weight 100lbs plus.    Find a reputable DME dealer and ask to trial some supportive rigid backrests. There are some great modular ones. It will depend if your chair can accommodate them (ie if itâ€™s the right size for you. Often people who just buy a chair off the shelf without it being prescribed pick a folding hospital type chair that is much too wide). Thereâ€™s also one from Roho called a corback thatâ€™s good and a bit less expensive. 

I agree with another comment who recommended a solid seat pan - the flex and angle that upholstered seats can create can be very sore. Then Iâ€™d suggest you get a moderate pressure relieving cushion, like a Supracor Stimulite or a Varilite Evolution. Ride makes a very soft one called the Java. If your sensation is impaired you are still at risk for pressure ulcers which can really mess you up.

Have you had any rehab? If you are unable to walk and have pain and sensation loss it sounds like youâ€™d benefit from it, even as an outpatient. As the commenters here pretty much coveredâ€”there are great rigid back options, and you probably want to go through a local DME distributor (DME= durable medical equipment; they work through most insurance, often need referrals from occupational therapists or rehab therapist, sometimes just primary doctor suffices).

I just wanted to add a bit about online options, since you mentioned amazon. Sadly, as a regular amazon user for nearly everything else, I have to report that amazon is basically useless for any of this equipment. It just doesnâ€™t carry any wheelchair equipment, except the most rudimentary for-your-grandma-or-broken-leg junk. Sportaid.com is good, carries way more than amazon. 

Unfortunately, most equipment is hugely over priced, because the assumption is itâ€™s going through insurance. So while you can get most of the suggested backs on sportaid, if you can go through insurance...do that. Plus the fitting correctly through a DME specialist is invaluable  I went through many cushions until I found the right one. Are you using SCI-intended cushions? Iâ€™ve found those work the best for me and my situation is similar, a damaged spinal cord due to surgery. I have reduced sensation but am not paralyzed.  if you're in the UK, go see a wheelchair clinic for a long term solution where you will get proper expertise on exactly what your body needs.if you want to avoid experts then i have a bitus projects cushion, which just sits on top of the fabric seat of my chair. i also have a quickie argon 2 chair which did have many different back options. its comfy as hell.

you can get seats perfectly moulded to your body too: [https://www.specialisedorthoticservices.co.uk/product/moulded-seat-insert-msi/](https://www.specialisedorthoticservices.co.uk/product/moulded-seat-insert-msi/)

I would really advice if you can, to see experts in mobility care as buying a chair isnt the same as furniture. you may be using this chair 24/7 and this means you need it to fit you perfectly to avoid pressure sores, back pain, supporting all your limbs at the correct angle etc. If you just use a standard chair then you will end up damaging your body more
