Looking to share a new device with musicians in wheelchairs Looking for individuals with physical handicaps that are musicians.  I am helping a friend with a device he developed that replaces the sip-and-puff.  I'll post a video of the demo he did last week as soon as I get the OK.  There are applications for music, gaming, and home  and more once its open sourced. He wants to give a few devices to people around the world to test it out.  He did it to play double bass drums.  Sorry I can't share more about the technology here (respecting my friends wishes to keep it stealthy).
