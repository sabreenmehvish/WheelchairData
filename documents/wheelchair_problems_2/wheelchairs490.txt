Quick 5 question survey for my Masters Dissertation. Starting a construction company that focuses on wheelchair accessibility. Please fill out!  I took your survey.  29 year old wheelchair user here (13 years in chair) 

Best of luck on the dissertation and your construction company - need more folks with cool ambition and care for others.  I'd be happy to fill out your survey, but I'm from the UK, do you want US only or worldwide? thank you for taking the time to respond, I really appreciate it.
