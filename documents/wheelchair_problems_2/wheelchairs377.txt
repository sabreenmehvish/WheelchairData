Where to buy iPad mount for wheelchair on a Sunday in Montreal? Hi everyone,
I'm in Montreal for today and my manager asked me to get an iPad mount that connects to the tubing of a wheelchair for our big boss. 
I'm wondering if there's any possible place that would be open today that would have that sort of thing? I was thinking medical supply stores but I don't imagine any are open on the weekend, especially Sunday.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I bought an cool one on amazon.  works well.  I don't use it on my chair but I can imagine it would work if needed.   Your best bet is a good bicycle shop. But check it out before you buy. If it works on a bicycle, you have a better than 50% chance it will work on a wheelchair. But try it before you buy it. Most versatile mount is Velcro!
