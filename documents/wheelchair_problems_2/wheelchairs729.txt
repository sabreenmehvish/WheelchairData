Minivan Transfers - Any Advice? Hi all,

I'm looking for any and all advice on how to transfer into the passenger seat of my Honda Odyssey minivan. My chair is at 21" and the minivan is at 29" with a large gap from chair to car seat.

Any tips, tricks, links, and any other information is most appreciated! A transfer board will help bridge to gap. You will still need to lift yourself with your upper body strength. First few time you will break a sweat. it will easier after that.
