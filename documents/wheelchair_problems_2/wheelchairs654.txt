Wheelchair Users: Questions Hello, I am sophomore industrial design student working on solving the difficulties that wheelchair users face daily. One of my ideas was to create a backpack that can hold everything you need while keeping you organized but is also easy to access while sitting in your wheelchair. It would also be versatile for both wheelchair users and non-wheelchair users. I would really appreciate any response to my survey. I am open to any other ideas, so please feel free to message me.

They work way better than any backpack as far as one handed reach and go. And can just be left on the chair when I flip it upside-down to take it apart to get in a vehicle. If I was ever going to use any kind of large pack I would only use it one under my seat. Everyone's different I guess but that's what I've grown to prefer Another time, you need to work on your questions before sending them out.

 So a normal backpack? 

 Is it supposed to be original or can you remake an old concept?   Reason I ask is because they already make wheelchair backpacks. All sorts of wheelchair organizers to be completely truthful.
