Quadriplegics: any review of the head array? To anyone who has experienced using a head array to control the wheelchair: how did it go?  I have Secondary Progressive MS and am a quad. I'm worried about how to use it. Any advice or anecdotes would be helpful. Thank you! Hi my boyfriend works in the wheelchair industry. He does a lot with headrests/backrests. He said he would be happy to answer any particular questions you may have. He works for Stealth/ADI if that means anything to you. He also knows a ton of information about competitor brands.
