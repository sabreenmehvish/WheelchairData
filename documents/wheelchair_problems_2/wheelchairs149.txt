Add safety to your wheelchair  Another great solution is [reflective stickers](http://www.pogu.co.uk/shop/pogu-3m-scotchlite-high-visibility-buggy-reflector-stickers) , originally for strollers. I use the black ones, which are pretty stealthy on my black chair.  Great feedback! Fit Grips are an option rather than a coated push rim, and your idea of reflective stickers is a great, cost effective solution.
