Wheelchair/Powerchair recommendation I currently have a Golden Compass Sport from Medicare (i have had it for about six months) and while it works alright for me its destroying my house (scraping paint, dents, etc) and isnt really portable (my  mom has a lift and the bus system does too, but no friends or family members do) making me seek out a new chair.

I previously had a Pride Z chair that was bought out of pocket by family since I dint have medicaid then. It worked well and could be broken down easily by friends and family for transportation purposes. While it did cause a few dents and scrapes here and there, nowhere near as many as the golden compass sport (I've had the z chair for 6 years and it was previously used when i bought, I've only had the golden for 6 months)

I've been looking at those fordable power chairs such as the kd smartchair, ez lite cruiser, foldawheel etc but dont know if they would meet my needs (stroke victim,, cant walk but can transfer by myself and pretty independent) and dont really want to spend the money if I dont need to.

I thought about fixing up my z chair but it would probably cost as much  as getting one of those fordable powerchairs.


Has anyone tried or use one of those foldable powerchairs? Is it easy to manuever, easy to transport? 

Does anybody have any recommendations pr input on a chair that woukd fit my needs (easy maneuverability in house, portable)


 Curious, if you can easily transfer yourself, why are you going with power over manual? Because I have hemiparesis on the left side and can only use the right arm and when I try to push myself in a manual chair I just spin in circles half the time. I also have to depend on other people to push me while with a powerchair I can be more independent.

Also manual wheelchairs tend to be wider due to the large wheels which makes it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.
