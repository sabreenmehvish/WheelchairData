How do you inflate this type of tire? (Rear tires off of a power wheelchair) Details inside... Is the orange plug a one way valve that we can insert the pump needle in to inflate them or will that damage the valve OR are they foam filled rather than pneumatic hense the orange plug where the valve stem would be? [Pictures of tire.](https://imgur.com/a/ODgQM2g) Hopefully someone else can verify this, but if there is not a small hole (like on a basketball), those sure look like they are foam filled to me. We supply this item of [power wheelchair](https://www.yattll.com/a/Products/Electric_Wheelchair/2018/0822/lightweight-wheelchair-YE245C.html) built with the pneumatic tires, not needed to inflate. 

Any interesting about power wheelchair sourcing, just visit the website: www.yattll.com. That is what we are thinking. It seems they have been filled with foam from where the valve stem should be & then snipped to sit flush(ish). I wanted to confirm that prior to bothering with them. Thanks for the input.  I can confirm that they are foam filled. Looking at the rim, it would be best to order an entire wheel assembly (tire and rim) when you want to replace them.
