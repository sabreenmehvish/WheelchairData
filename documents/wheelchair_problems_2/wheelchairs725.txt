Any techs around? Hey folks!

I just started a job as a service tech for a fairly large accessibility company. Everything from manual wheel chairs to stair lifts and ceiling mount lifts. 

Any tricks of the trade? Secrets? Not a tech but wheelchair user 

When we come to y'all we usually have been through it all fighting for the earliest appointment so we can get our life back and sometimes we are beyond frustrated with the hole process.be patient with us  I can only imagine the frustration that takes place when your wheels are down. I personally take pride in making sure customers are satisfied and the job is complete. I've always been that way and always will be. 

The downside to service centers is its a business and unfortunately we sometimes get swamped. I would love nothing more to have the failed part on hand at all times so I can repair it that day. 

I'm currently working on a power chair that another tech missed the caster stem bearings on, one week for delivery of those. Fortunately the client has a couple spare chairs. I can't fathom the anger and frustration the client would have if it was his only.
