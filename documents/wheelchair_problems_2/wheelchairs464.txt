Drive Powerstroll wheelchair power assist Does anybody use or have knowledge of the Drive Medical Products Powerstall power assist device? It is a motor and wheel that fits under a manual wheelchair to reduce or eliminate the force needed to push the chair.

Does anybody have or know about similar devices that attach to manual wheelchairs for power assistance? I don't know anyone that uses that Powerstroll, but have met many people that use [SmartDrive MX2 Power Assist](http://www.max-mobility.com/)...and they love it.

I have also met a couple people who use [Tailwind](https://www.clintonrivermedical.com/tailwind-features)...which they liked but was more of a permanent install vs the smartdrive. Look at the total weight. I don't know many people that will want to strap 43 lbs to their chair. I would rather go with a Alber E-motion set up or the Smart Drive. I have a SmartDriveâ€”I love it  The Powerstroll is a lot like the SmartDrive, but at under $600 it is much cheaper. Wow, yeah that is much cheaper.
