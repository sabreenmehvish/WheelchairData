United Destroys $40K Custom Wheelchair  Holy shit. I hope she sues for not only the wheelchair but the cost of the trip as well. 

The trip was ruined not only for that person but for everyone. 

They should pay back all the tickets, the cost of a new wheelchair, the expenses of the trip for the group and if you ask me, they should pay for pain and suffering for both the trip and every day gone without a wheelchair after it as well, plus any related injuries or hospital bills or bills for assistance  oh man this sucks!!!  I built a custom mobility scooter to help me deal with crowds (I have a brain tumor that causes my neurology to get freaked out by environments and the chair helps me feel in control).  I put a little mini-mustang body on it and the web-show Roadkill helped fly me out so I could attend their event as sort of a magic make-a-wish trip kind of thing and Delta CRUSHED it!  Thankfully the racetrack lent me a golf-cart so I actually got an upgrade and the trip turned out awesome.  Sadly I'm still working to get the thing repaired.  I got it working with my own wiring bypasses and whatnot but they are supposedly going to actually fix it for me eventually I'm glad that they were able to continue the trip despite this horrific incident. I would cry my eyes out if my chair was ruined and I'm a part-time chair user!
