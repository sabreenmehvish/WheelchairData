I had started a thread about gloves last year.  Can I add a suggestion? One of my customers recommended [these during the summer](http://ironclad.com/products/gloves/bhg-box-handler) and [these during the winter](http://ironclad.com/products/gloves/ccg-cold-condition)

He liked the grip and the fit. I have passed his recommendations on any time I am asked.
