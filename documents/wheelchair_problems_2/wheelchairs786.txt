Research Survey Hi I'm doing a school project and I have chosen to create a product that assists wheelchair users when getting in and out of vehicles. I just have a few questions to ask so I could get a better understanding into how my product should be made. Your answers and any additional info will be appreciated.

Would you be interested in a product that made it easier to enter and exit a vehicle?

What is the most difficult part of getting into a vehicle?

Aesthetically what would you prefer the product to look like?

Would you prefer the product to be electric or manual, or does it matter?

What specific things or features would you want such a product to have? Have a look at this subreddit. Every 2 days someone asks a similar research question. Usually not much comes out of it. 

But I did see a device that helped wheelchair users transfer into cars. It might be of interest to you. He is a photo of it
