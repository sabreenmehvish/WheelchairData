ADAPTIVE CLOTHING LINE IZ COLLECTION SHOWS HOW INCLUSIVE FASHION CAN BE  I purchased a pair of their $100 jeans and my wife has had to fix seams and hems at least 4 times. I like the fit but they need to pay a lot more attention to QA before I spend another $100 on their jeans.

ABL is a much better brand with a pair of jeans at Wal-Mart being $40. I have two pair of their jeans and I love them.
