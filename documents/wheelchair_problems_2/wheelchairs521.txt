Lightest backrest possible Looking to get a new chair. What are some super light backrest options. I've got a Jay back currently and hate the bulkiness of the thing . 

Thanks for the help! I use a Jay Carbon, but it depends what level of support you need really. ADI carbon fiber. If you have any questions let me know.
