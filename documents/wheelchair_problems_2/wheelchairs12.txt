♿️11 WHEELCHAIR PET PEEVES WE HATE!  Do they mention being cigarette-in-hand level to most people smoking? Maybe it's not a problem in some places, but very annoying in Europe. So many feels. The one that really bugs me is the person pushing me (aside from the part that they’re being amazing and helping me) assumes that my foot plates are about a foot further back than they actually are. Sorry to everyone walking in front of me.  How did she not mention people assuming you need/want help and start pushing you without asking first? That bothers me more than anything else.  Scares the bejesus out of me when ppl start pushing you, when you havent heard or realised they're gonna do it. Mind your fingers.... I love the illustrated examples! Leaners make me rage, and the folks who pat my shoulders or head make steam comes out of my ears.

&#x200B; Absolutely.  It’s downright frightening and has lead me to absolutely hating being pushed by anyone This!
