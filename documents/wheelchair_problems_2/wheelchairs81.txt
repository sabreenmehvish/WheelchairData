Maybe this is the next big thing?  For the 12 people who can afford it, maybe.  Not without acceptance from insurers. The other self-balancing two wheeled Segway chair starts at CDN$26,000 AND you can't take it on a plane. Basically it's for Larry Flynt.

Lovely innovation but clearly they are overestimating the willingness of insurers to reimburse. 30% of Americans have trouble even getting a folding hospital style wheelchair covered.  Very cool stuff.  I wonder how it handle static position (on the bus, at a table, etc).  I'm guessing it has a mode where it settles to the ground or something. This is awesome! Hopefully the technology will become more readily available so this can start to become cheaper.

Also, the guy's smile in the video just killed me!
