Wheelchair Golf Project Input Request Hi everyone, 

I'm a college student currently working on a project that involves potentially adapting a wheelchair in order for individuals to hopefully swing a golf club! With the project being in the very early stages, I was hoping to get some input from this community. The basics of the idea is to lift the user slightly to move the knees, and have a swiveling mechanism in the chair to create a rotating motion. 

Is the idea of adaptive golf interesting to any of you? 
What challenges do you see with this project? 
What are your current experiences with adaptive sports? 

Any input or information would be greatly appreciated and hopefully lets get this project rolling! 


Thanks so much.

This is the cart I have experience with. I like that you have easy access to your clubs, and that it is easy enough to swing the seat to the side. 

The main trouble is the belt around the chest restricts my swing. If not set up correctly, your legs tend to dangle more than they are planted. 

A better design in my mind would be one where your feet are flat on the ground and minimal restriction to your swing. PM me if you would like to ask me any questions. I was a golfer for 5 years before my car accident 6 years ago, and I have played a couple of rounds each year since.
