Another quadriplegic racer, who is building his own racecar!  that's awesome... I'm glad more wheelchair users are doing this, I've been racing for 3 year and  have a car for asphalt and dirt in the Houston area as well as a championship season under my belt ... I have CP and use a chair to daily get around..

It takes a lot of work but to be behind the wheel racing is the best payoff
