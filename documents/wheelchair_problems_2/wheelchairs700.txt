Length of caster forks on manual chair Hi professionals,

I'm wondering how the length of forks makes a difference in manual wheelchairs. Are durability (of bearings) maneuvering,or other ride qualities affected?

Getting ready for a new chair and weighing options. This is a good question. Fork length should really be a function of caster wheel size. Caster wheel size can drastically change ride quality.  Larger casters make rolling over cracks and bumps easy and smoother. Softer casters can also yield a smoother ride. Larger casters may interfere  with turning in tight quarters or may reduce foot space. Small casters are often used for sports where there is a surface with a smooth surface. The caster arm should be sized for the caster you will be using. A short arm will not allow for larger casters, but a longer arm with small casters   is a waste.
