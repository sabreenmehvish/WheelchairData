Why aren't there more wheelchair accessories to buy? There are millions of people who use a wheelchair to get around, so why is it so difficult to find high-quality accessories for such simple things as protection from the weather and safety features like head and tail lights?

I've resorted to making a lot of my own accessories and using the help of a very creative friend who sews.  

I have two wrapping leg blankets...one for rain and the other for the rain but is also insulated...but the small Canadian company has not sold them for years. 

Are there other stores I am just not coming across or is there a serious lack of decent wheelchair accessory options available to buy? Baby stroller accessories work great. I have a stroller cup holder on mine and it works perfectly. 

Problem is there aren’t “millions” of wheelchair users. Many are temporary. Those of us that are permanently in one number very few. The market is very small, so why bother with people who only need a chair short term? They don’t want or care about accessories. However, look at those “as seen on tv” products and late night infomercials. They’re mobility products, but they have to have silly commercials to market to a larger audience.

Substitute for IV pole if your equipment has portable bags to be carried \- [Think King Stroller hooks](https://www.amazon.com/Think-King-Stroller-Wheelchair-Rollator/dp/B002MXP3SM/ref=sr_1_8_s_it?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1527828110&sr=1-8&keywords=stroller+hooks)   I personally use these for my son and they are the only stroller hooks I have found strong enough to hold his pump and enteral pump set without breaking under the weight.    

Adaptive clothing \- [Adaptions by Adrian](https://www.adaptationsbyadrian.com/)I don't shop there anymore because my son turned into a teenager and decided their wheelchair capes weren't cool and he only wanted to wear hoodies from here on out.     It was nice to have something warm to throw over him that didn't have to be maneuvered around cushions and straps.     The capes are waterproof and made out of very warm heavy fleece.   I haven't tried their other products but their sewing quality is professional level sewing.      My company will launch a rain protection product in August just in time for Autumn weather. For more information go[ **here**](http://rehadesign.com/products/wheelchair-umbrella-system) There are accessories available, but often times if they are made specifically for wheelchair users they are very expensive (because a group of users) or are very specialized and only work with a certain chair.  Or the companies that make the products are small and don't have the promotional budget to advertise.

Bicycle accessories often work pretty good, especially cheap lights.

If you want a rain cover for your legs, [Rehadesign](http://rehadesign.com/products/wheelchair-umbrella-system) is coming out with one called Rayne Sheild Leg Protectors.  My wife was a product testor for this product and it worked pretty great...should be available publicly any time.

We also like [Ram Mount] (https://www.rammount.com/industry/healthcare) products for cup, phone, and tablet holders.

 I would really love a bag, for shopping. SOmetimes I run out of milk or bread and have to go to the shop on my own, it's such a pain to get the items back. 
I really panic if I have to put things on the handles on the back as someone could easily swipe my shopping and run off, also it drags against my wheels.  Even the websites for major mobility providers are often poorly laid out with information hard to find or out of date. There is exactly one company I can find who makes fingerless gloves with a full thumb, and the prices for that set vary wildly depending on where you find them ([Hatch PWC200[(https://www.safariland.com/products/holsters-and-gear/gear/gloves/medical-and-safety/leather-wheelchair-para-push-gloves-half-finger-12635.html), if you wanted to know). It doesn't help that like so many other small companies who start making such things that they were bought up by a larger company.

I end up making most of what I need as well, either from scratch or cobbled out of bicycle and motorcycle parts. Accessories specifically for wheelchairs seem to be pricier simply because they can claim the product is for a medical device. They also seem to be a bit lower quality than most products I'd normally want. Weak stitching, brittle plastic pieces, and a general "beta tester" feel seem to accompany so many products... Half the time I make it myself just because if it's shit, I have no one to blame but me XD I hadn't thought about using baby stroller accessories...thanks! 

Any idea on how many are non-temp users?  Maybe it just seems like more to me since there are a fair number in my average-looking community that isn't very accessible and wouldn't seem like a draw. A lot of the stroller accessories are just plain black without a bunch of colors so no one will know it was for a stroller. I have a cup holder, bag, and some stroller bag hooks.  It's a bit pricey, but I've found success using my set of Phoenix Instinct luggage for solo shopping trips. The duffel and carry-on bags both clip securely to the towel bar, have omni-wheels so they glide with the chair, and are weighted so they don't change your balance point. I don’t have hard data, I’m going off what I’ve seen at hospitals and just around. I see many more basic wheelchairs than custom ones. Custom chairs tell me long term. Maybe they’re waiting for a custom? Dunno. But I’ve had to get creative, and sometimes that’s part of the fun. Sometimes it works, often it doesn’t. My house and garage are filled with good intentions.  Thanks for you reply I'll have to look into them, I don't know what a towel bar is though, I can't have foot rests on my chair because of spasms. But if it isn't then I might look into buying one, thanks so much! No worries, I hope it helps! The towel bar is the bar on the back of rigid chairs, but it should be noted that they also make adapters for folding chairs. Additionally, I think their new carry-on size actually uses a different adapter which makes it more universal, but info on that one is a little harder to come by as it's still in it's kickstarter stage. Thanks so much for the reply and the information :)
