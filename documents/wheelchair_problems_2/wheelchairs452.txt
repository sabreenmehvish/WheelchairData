Spare Wheelchair Racing Wheel Hubs Does anyone know if the individual hubs can be bought for either the the Corima C+ 2D disc wheels or the Zipp 900 Tubular Disc wheels.

The current hubs are not broken but I like to see how the hubs are assembled therefore I would like a spare set for each wheel to cut open. I'd assume they can, do you have pictures of the hubs at all to get brand information off? Usually it can be read off the side of the hub when taken off the chair, if the hub itself isn't branded. They're just the same as any other hub though.
