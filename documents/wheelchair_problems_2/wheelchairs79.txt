New mod Hello everyone! I just took over as mod of /r/wheelchairs and hope I can help bring a little life into this sub. I have been on Reddit for a few years and have occasionally commented here for most of that time.   I don't plan on changing much here because the standard layout works with many different reading platforms. Instead, I plan on just keeping up with cleaning out the spam and helping us grow.  You seem like you'll be great :)  Thanks for volunteering. I appreciate this space exists. Thank you! If you have any feedback, please let me know.
