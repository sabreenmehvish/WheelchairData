Attendant/Transport wheelchair for vacation Hello! Was going to go on vacation to Japan with my daughter next year, and I was looking into getting a wheelchair that can be light, 'foldable', and easy to move around in for mostly metropolitan areas.

My daughter has mild cerebral palsy, and can walk for very short distances, so we usually use a wheelchair for her when walking longer distances. I was looking into an 'Attendant/transport' wheelchair, but does anyone have any other suggestions?

Thanks! Drive medical has a light weight transport chair,  they are ok nothing great but nothing bad about them. Karman healthcare makes lightweight equipment as well. I bought Ezlitecruizer for myself so I can travel easy. It is a one piece foldable wheelchair and works great. I went on a trip to New Orleans and my partner would fold and open it, it is about 53 lbs with battery. For air travel smaller battery is approved so be careful what you buy. My cost delivered was about US $2,500. Make sure they know you need delivery by a certain time or you will cancel. Health insurers in the US do not approve this chair, not because the chair is bad.
