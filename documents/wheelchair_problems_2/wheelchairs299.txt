Breezy Elegance Parts? When I was having a long stretch with very little pain I made the mistake of lending my wheelchair to a friend whose husband had been in a car accident. She returned the chair to me without the legs. They had moved during this time and left the legs at their old apartment. By the time it was discovered, the legs had disappeared. 

My pain level has increased significantly and I now need the chair for longer trips. I tried to replace the legs and discovered that the chair has been discontinued and I can’t find replacements anywhere. Does anyone have advice on how to find legs that work? According to the medical supply store near me, I have no options except buying a new chair because the legs attach in a unique way so only Breezy parts will work. You might still be able to get replacement parts at ([Quickie Wheelchairs](https://www.quickie-wheelchairs.com/replacement-parts/sunrise-medical/breezy-elegance/seating-positioning/hangers/swing-away-legrest)) & ([Southwest Medical](https://www.southwestmedical.com/replacement-parts/sunrise-medical/breezy-elegance/seating-positioning/hangers/swing-away-legrest)). Looks like replacing the legs ([parts](http://www.sportaid.com/upload/products/19797/19797_1465322967_9209_parts.pdf) \# 064804-050) & footplate (#064871-101/2) will be about $190 for the pair including shipping.   
Have your friends offered to pay to replace the parts they failed to return? Perhaps a silly question but have you contacted Sunrise directly rather than through your medical supply store? They may be able to direct you to a distributor which still stocks your discontinued chair or even get you the parts directly. 

I'm sorry your friends didn't take good care of your chair and all its parts. They're important bits of kit and I don't think everyone appreciates how much. You're a nicer person than me, I'd never lend out my spare chair.   She said she would pay, but I know that I won’t have any luck collecting. She owes me far more money than this. It took me a while to learn that paying for her poor decisions was just enabling her instead of helping. 

Thank you so much for finding these links. I have ordered the parts and now have to cross my fingers. I actually ordered them once from somewhere else, only to fine their electronic inventory was incorrect and they didn’t actually have them in stock. I have certainly learned my lesson. No luck. Southwest medical just informed me they don’t have the parts, despite what the website says.
