Questions regarding wheelchairs and hotels Hi. Not sure if im allowed to post this here, let me know if not. 

I am an interior design student, who needs to design hotel rooms that must be accessible for wheelchairs. I was just wondering if you could help me out a little bit for my research. What do u expect from a hotel room? What do i miss in a lot of them/what would u like to see? What are the “annoying” things u experiance? 

I would appreciate u guys imput :) The worst thing is plush carpets. This includes convention rooms, the deep luxury carpets are impossible to navigate on wheels. I'm making a list for ease; if others could add their ideas in a reply I think it would be easier for OP. 

1. Lower beds! 20-26" is, I think, ADA. 
2. Thin carpets/linoleum. The plushness has got to go. 
3. Vanity access. I need to reach the whole vanity, see my beautiful face in the mirror, and brush my teeth in the sink. 
4. Door weight. Opening a door should not take more than 5 lbs of force. 
5. Bolt things down. Transferring onto a moving object is hard. 
6. Outlets by the bed. Some disabilities require oxygen, cpap, etc. 
7. Doorbells so the hearing impaired can see when someone is at the door.  Make the bed way lower and the toilet way higher. Oh also, bolt the toilet seat on with industrial strength bolts and make sure that thing doesn’t move. I don’t know why we have reached a point in society where we are basically ok with the toilet seat and the plastic screws that hold it on coming off whenever, but a loose or broken toilet seat can make transferring immeasurably harder. Where do I begin?!

-Lower beds
-Higher toilet seats
-No carpets
-Higher electrical outlets
-Lower door handles 
-A wetroom with a roll-in shower Pocket/barn/sliding doors. 

Enough space on all sides of the bed to navigate (I hate having to roll backwards to exit because I can't turn around.) 

Enough room under the sink to roll right up to it. 

Storage at a seated height.  - **TWO BEDS.** I'm tired of every room having this massive king sized bed, as if that helps. (Admittedly, I need to travel with others, and I don't fancy sleeping with all, or even most, of them.) I mean, there's no reason you can't have some with two queens and some with a king, to accommodate everyone.

- Many people need "cutouts" under the beds, as well, for Hoyers and whatnot. And stop making them so high that I need to use a step-stool / my wheelchair footplate.

- If there is anything with drawers in the room, *please* include handles of some sort. And don't make them "auto-close" or "stick closed"... I just want simple, easy-to-pull drawers.

- Cutout under the sink. Everything within reach of a chair. Easy-to-use faucets (I like [these](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/fetch/Category_Pages/Bath/Sinks/moen-single-faucet.jpg) types, the [one-handled](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/952e9ae6-43f3-4434-a7bb-47bd1ea9828d/svn/stainless-steel-glacier-bay-pull-out-faucets-67737-0008d2-64_1000.jpg) style, but that's just me).

- More, and more accessible, outlets. Three-pronged (US). I need them on the side of the bed (which everyone has their own preferred side), and probably across the room (for like, laptops), so basically put them *everywhere*.

- A bathroom that won't flood/leak when you take a shower. More easy-to-use faucets. A showerhead that will move down on the wall, or mount somewhere lower (most say "handheld," but I/many need a mounted one). "Shelves" close to a shower seat, appropriate height, of course.

- A door I can actually open. (I got told this was "fire safety," yet some places have fine doors, so... idk what to believe.) Light(er) weight, close slowly, and don't "stick" when closed.

- Kinda minor, but... Preferably, I like having a desk in the room. Sometimes accessible rooms don't have these to "save space," but it assumes we don't have "normal wants or activities" in a way. We're mostly like you, just need a bit more room and outlets sometimes :)

- Also minor: if the hotel itself offers a refrigerator in rooms, have it do all temps. I'm prone to muscle aches and try to keep an ice pack with me, but not every fridge will get cold enough. Other people travel with medications that need to be kept cold. And I'm sure there's other uses. A lot of the hotels I go to seem to stay at like 40F, which... well, certainly isn't preferable for me, idk about meds.

- (Edit) I like the suggestions of higher toilets. They could be higher in all rooms, even the non-accessible ones :P If the bathroom door is going to open up, make it open in such a way that it can be closed without obstructing the chair rolling in or out of the room. More of an issue in public stalls, but it can happen around hotels, too. My first thought was that beds need to be lower. The beds in most of the more expensive hotels are usually so high they are either extremely difficult or impossible to transfer into and getting back into your wheelchair usually involves basically falling out of bed and hoping for the best!

I understand that doors have those arms that make them automatically shut for fire safety, but at least set them so they don't require so much strength to open. Getting through them while using a wheelchair is hard enough, but trying to get luggage through them too is on a whole other level. We are paying the same amount as other guests, but if there is no one with us that can help up in or out of those high beds often times we have to end up sleeping on a couch or cot. Also, instead of just lowering the peephole, add a second one that is at sitting height. If a non wheelchair user is with us they don't want to crouch down to see who's at the door and sometimes these rooms are occupied by guests who are not wheelchair users.

Flimsy little plastic shower benches that don't have a back and are designed to sit inside the tub are especially useless for a lot of wheelchair users. If there is a tub instead of a roll in shower we are somehow expected to transfer over a huge gap and onto an unstable tiny bench. This is even more dangerous when everything is wet! Ideally there would be a roll in shower (that is designed so water actually flows towards a drain and doesn't flood the entire bathroom) with a large enough bench. At the bare minimum if there is a bath tub there should at least be a tub transfer bench that comes out over the side of the tub (and leaves enough room for a wheelchair using guest to turn around) and with a back. A lot of us don't have the best balance and need something to lean against. Also, make sure the shower head is within reach when sitting on the bench.

Light switches. outlets etc should all be within reach and not too high or low along with other common items (hair dryers, irons, coffeepots, towel racks etc).

Closets should have real hangers that are not attached to the rod by a ring! Hanging clothes on these can be infuriating when you can't quite get into the right position. Also, mirrors should be lowered.

I'd highly recommend the next time you are in a hotel to take a chair and sit in the middle of the room and have a close look around. Imagine that is your height all of the time and I bet you will notice things that wouldn't have even crossed your mind before!

Edit: I forgot to add if a fancy 'sit on top of the countertop sink' is going to be added, make sure that the countertop can be lowered so there is still enough clearance to roll under it and that the height of the top of the sink is no taller than the original accessible countertop would usually be. Handrails in the bath/shower. Handrails next to toilet to assist in getting on and off. Don't put a marble topped dresser made from solid wood with a 42 in tv on it right in front of the entrance way so there is only a foot of clearance  A lot of places have the main light switch somewhere near the entrance to the room and a little bed side lamp. More light to see what you're doing is helpful but it's a pain to get settled in bed then realise you left the light on and go through all the rigmarole to get back out and wheel over to switch it off. A switch by the side of the bed that switches the main lights on/off solves this problem and also means that you can have a fully lit room when you get up in the morning. Obviously not an issue for everyone and the main light switch by the door is still useful when entering/exiting the room, it just makes life a bit easier. If you're paying for a hotel you still want it too look nice as well, some places will have accessible rooms that look more like a hospital type situation than the standard rooms. Yes some adaptations need to be made but it is still possible to make the room look good.

A common theme when booking accommodation that I've found is 'yes its wheelchair accessible.......but there is a small lip into the room and another to get into the shower' for me I can cope with that but there are others that can't so even though places are accessible they're still not really accessible to everyone.

 Oh wow! Thank you so much! Will definitely take notes and use all of ur info :) Restrooms not big enough to turn around in. Locks and peepholes being way too high. No shower seat. Towel racks being so high. I hate it when all the closet bars are at a low height. I may use a wheelchair, but I'm 5'10" and I often travel for weddings where I have floor length dresses that need to be hung up. Give me a peg or two for gowns! The toilet part. Transferring down 10 inches, then up 10 inches on unfamiliar porcelain is not fun. Also, stop putting shit under the elevator button.  Agreed! Even the ADA toilet height is way to low for me, man. My chair sits at 27” from the ground to the top of the seat.
