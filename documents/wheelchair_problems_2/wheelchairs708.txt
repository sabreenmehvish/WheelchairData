Starting a Curling(ice) program at the Curling club. Where is a good place to post a flyer so it will be seen by potential participants. Wheelchair curling is a super competitive sport without out the physicality of basketball or sled hockey. I would suggest advertising with other wheelchair sports groups. Not everyone is into sports. But the people who are already participating in other wheelchair sports may be interested in participating in one more.
