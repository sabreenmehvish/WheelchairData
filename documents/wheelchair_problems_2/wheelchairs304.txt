Hand-trike attaches to front of wheelchair  Holy shit! I would feel so free. Looks like I'd break that thing in a week.  how is this new? those things are around for at least 20 years... and all suffer from the same flaw: you don’t really get any weight on the front wheel. all the weight is on the wheelchair wheels so you have to accelerate very slowly and any small ascend will take almost all traction from the front wheel, making it impossible to accelerate. don’t get me wrong, those things are fine on a good and flat path. but nothing more... and again: nothing new they invented here.
