Anybody have one of those lightweight electric chairs that fold up/ collapse? I just got a new manual chair through insurance and I love it, but I had a hard time deciding if I should get a manual or a power chair (since my condition effects my arms too, just not as severely as it does my hips and knees)

I was wondering if anybody has one of those lightweight electric "travel chairs" and if so, do you like it? 

My manual is perfect for my day-to-day life, but there are some instances (like music festivals, traveling) where it would be nice to have something electric. 

If you have one, which one do you have? And do you like it? I know they're not meant for daily use but how do they hold up as far as you've noticed? 

Edited to add: would I maybe be better off getting a power assist that I can add to my manual chair, like the smart drive device? [Earlier post here may be of interest]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/wheelchairs/comments/58vodu/share_your_outdoor_experience_with_the_new_range/) My wife is a quadriplegic and we got her a [KD Smart Chair](https://kdsmartchair.com/) for visiting friends with inaccessible homes or emergencies.


It is OK.


Pros:

* Lightweight and easily portable

* With another person, can easily carry lift her and chair up stairs (chair and her together are around 150 lbs)

* Gives her much more ability to move around on carpeted areas (she doesn't have a lot of arm strength to push a manual more than a few feet at a time on shag carpet)

* Haven't put it through any extreme tests but the battery life seems pretty good

* Battery charger is super small and lightweight.  We actually take it with us when we travel with her normal chair - it charges slow but only weighs like 1 lb (vs 15 lbs for her normal charger) and will get her normal chair to full charge overnight.

Cons:

* No real handles to lift her and chair at same time (probably not supposed to, but since that is why we got it...)

* Doesn't always fold up as easy as it should. Everything needs to be in the correct position before folding...but the correct position is not obvious.

* Terrible instructions/documentation on chair (you are basically on your own)

* Control is very jerky compared to her normal powerchair

* Seat cushion is pretty much crap.  We use her normal seat cushion on it (but has to be removed to fold up).

* You cannot adjust your seating positioning much (so she gets tired and sore after longer periods)

* Mudgaurds on tires are crap and we broke them off  within the first couple uses.

* Good on smooth terrain, but I don't think it would be very good in grass or any more difficult landscapes.


My personal thoughts - it is nice to have when needed, but wish there were some improvements.  I think it was a worthwhile investment for us (especially when her normal chair was being fixed for a week). Following.

I was hoping to purchase a Fold & Go brand or a EZ Lite Cruiser, as they seemed to be the best options of the folding powerchairs. Look into e-motion wheels for your manual chair. Highly recommend them. smart drive is a great option, we sell them more than the motion wheels, you need a rigid frame wheelchair to use the smart drive i believe, unless they have a new bracket out. karman health makes the cheapest($ wise) folding powerchair. Thank you so much for this! I was worried about just about every one of those cons. I was hoping it'd be better on rough terrain, as I was hoping a chair like this could maybe make it possible for me to get back to Europe for vacation some day. 

Thanks for the review! The EZ lite is the one I've been looking at too. I'd really love to get a smartdrive for my manual chair but they're SO expensive! I've read about those some, they seem kind of heavy. And they're almost the same price as the smartdrive which seems easier to manage. Eeek, yeah that's more than a pretty penny. 

I looked into both, and I would prefer the EZ Lite. However, I probably will end up with the Fold & Go because they have a rent-to-own option. I don't qualify for financing on the EZ Lite. Oh! If you fly often or semi-often, I'd go with the Fold & Go. You don't have to remove the batteries of the Fold & Go when it goes down, you do with the EZ Lite. They are basically electric wheels with sensors. You push, they role. It is similar to the smartdrive. When it comes to weight there are ultra light, light and then heavier from there on. It all depends on what's more convenient for you but they are definitely easier on your shoulders to prevent tendonitis and fatigue. Depending on which you get and from who I believe they're about two grand a pair. Oh really? That's awesome I thought they were more like 6grand a pair! I may have to look into them further. Would be great to have them as an option sometimes. Definitely man
