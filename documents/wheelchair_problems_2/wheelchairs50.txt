Sex and Physical Disabilities Survey Hi!  My name is Andrew Gurza and I am a Disability Awareness Consultant with Cerebral Palsy who uses a wheelchair.  I work primarily in sex and disability, and I'm doing research on sex toys for people with disabilities.   I have created a brief survey that I would like you to fill out so that I can get more research data. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/sextoydisability
