Charger question Will a 5 amp charger work for group 24 batteries? I'm looking at a mightymax aftermarket charger to use for traveling \(smaller/lighter\). My original charger is an Invacare 8amp. It will work but with issues. First is the time to charge will be MUCH longer. It does not seem like 3 amps would be a big difference, however, it does and may cause you problems. Second, it will burn out the charger. Because the charger is working harder and longer than planned, it will have a shorter work life. If you are looking for smaller and lighter a charger [like this](https://www.batterymart.com/p-24bc8000t-1-24v-8a-agm-charger-xlr.html?mobile=TRUE&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=24BC8000T-1&utm_campaign=PLA&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrLXXBRCXARIsAIttmRMUjet5yzPBHoyvsYOuU-y4oLu9IZ6SQT5HapELWnCxE_zRdbvX55caAoxWEALw_wcB) would be a good bet. You can find them cheaper but I am being lazy this Saturday morning. Thanks! I figured it would charge a little slower but didn't think it would be that slow :)
