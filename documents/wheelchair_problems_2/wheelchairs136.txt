New Medicare ids Starting in April 2018, Medicare beneficiaries will receive their new ID numbers and cards. In three past their ID number was their social security number with a letter at the end.  In 2015 Congress passed the MARCRA that required Medicare to change to a unique identifier to help prevent identity theft.   The new card looks good while staying similar enough to the old card to stay visible.

Providers will have 21 months to change to billing under the new ID.

 Thanks for this. I saw they were doing new cards but didn't know anything else about it. Hopefully it'll be a smooth transition.
