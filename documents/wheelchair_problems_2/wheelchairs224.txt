Trendy Wheelchair Clothing Hey guys!

I'm doing my senior thesis on re-designing adaptive clothing/update it to fit in with current trends for wheelchair users and just wanted some feedback from a few people and I figured reddit would be the best place to ask!

Let me know what are the most annoying things about wearing clothes/ going to the bathroom/ anything else relating to clothes.
If you want to fill out my survey (has more in depth questions) this would also be extremely helpful: https://goo.gl/forms/lfmbIJziLpAphYco2

Thanks guys and also if anyone else wants to discuss this topic with me in depth please hmu in my inbox B-) filled out most the the survey. good luck to you! I would love if more men could fill this out! I'm having a lot more women fill it out but I would also love for more feedback from everyone!!!  As a caregiver the biggest challenge I have when it comes to clothing is that they're not stretchy enough for people with limited range of motion  Survey has been submitted. Thank you for your interest in making functional clothing for wheelchair users. thank you! any information is helpful information
