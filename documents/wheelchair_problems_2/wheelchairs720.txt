Replacement tires for 9000SL. I have a 9000 SL that I've used daily for ten or so years and the rubber tires have broken apart.. I've tried to find a replacement online, and I can't seem to find any I can order. Can anyone direct me to some I could order?

I was also thinking about maybe buying some nicer wheels for it, but I'd be better off using that on a new wheelchair... And I don't know what would be compatible. https://www.aftermarketgroup.com/product/24-Tires-(Excludes-1-3!@@$8-width)/141310

Most 9000SLs have a 24 x 1 solid foam tire.  They can come in with a  22" or 20"  instead.  The Aftermarket Group is owned by Invacare so can sell Invacare parts at the cheapest prices.  If your wheels are 24", do not try to put a 24 x 1 3/8 tire on it.  It will not work.  Otherwise you can get any solid 1" wide tire. Thank you very much. How should I measure my rim? From the edge of the rim from one side to the other? It should say right on your tire. That's the easy route.
