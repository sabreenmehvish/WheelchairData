How to go about getting to demo different wheelchairs I want to get a standing wheelchair - preferably powered but can't for the life of me figure out where to go to get a demo of some of them. I will most likely be paying for it out of pocket so I want to make sure my selection is the right thing. I think the Permobil looks the best and has the best reviews but what do you all think? How should I go about this? Permobil does make the best standing frame wheelchairs.  Find a local ATP or RTS at a Complex Rehab Provider. As a former RTS I was more than happy to let people demo chairs. I want them to make the right choice for them.   If you know you want a Permobil, call them and ask who their closest supplier is.  You should try and find a wheelchair vendor. They will often have loaners that people can use while their custom is fabricated. NuMotion is the company I use in Indiana.
