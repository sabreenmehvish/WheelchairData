I have to use a power chair and I'm going to need to replace this one soon. I'm most interested in a seat elevator, and I hate the ones that slow you down when elevated. Which models should I look for? I have an Invacare FDX. It elevates, but slowed down A LOT. Fortunately, I found a sensor I could put a tie on and that would block it. I understand why it slows you down because it feels like sitting on a flag pole, but it ways much too slow to even use. The Q6Edge 2.0 with iLevel has the fastest speed while elevated and the fastest elevating speed.
