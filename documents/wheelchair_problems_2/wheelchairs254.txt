The Rowheels REV1, wheelchair wheels you pull instead of push So I'm a mechanical engineer who has been a quadriplegic going on 20 years and about 10 years ago, while I was still in engineering school, I had the idea of creating wheelchair wheels that you could pull to go forward instead of pushing to alleviate all the shoulder related injuries/issues caused by pushing (about 70% of long-term manual wheelchair users develop shoulder related injuries). Started the company about four years ago and after a lot of work we finally have a great product that I think could make a big difference in the lives of manual wheelchair users. Here's a video:

 I like it because this motion was always easier for me since I could use my core to lean back and pull. Leaning forward to get some assistance with a push is not the same thing... Hi midnight Daisy,
One of the things I've learned now that I am involved in the "medical device" industry is that pricing is a lot more complicated than I thought. I used to complain about wheelchair related items being overly expensive and companies taking advantage of users but I've learned that there's a lot more that goes into it. We need a SADMERC (medicare) approved billing code so that our wheels can be purchased through insurance. The code that we classify for has a minimum reimbursement allowable of around $4000 depending on state and we cannot charge less than that, otherwise we lose the code. It's a little strange but that is how it works. If you have insurance, VA or Medicare/Medicaid you will probably pay a small percentage of that. In some cases you pay nothing.
