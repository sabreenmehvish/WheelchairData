I don't post about accidents involving wheelchairs, but this escalator death is a warning.  It is a heartbreaking story, and I understand in some places there's a serious issue with elevators not working. But, at the same time, a power chair and an escalator is a "no shit" recipe for disaster (and, as bad as this is, it's a good thing no one else was hurt in this accident).

I've done some dumb stuff in my teenage years and I used to ride the escalators at the mall when there was no elevator nearby, but that was in my 20 pound manual wheelchair, I had the upper body strength to do it and I always had one of my friends or family members behind me. Not the safest thing and I DO NOT do it anymore and I DO NOT advocate doing it. But a 20-30 pound manual wheelchair is much different than a 300+ pound power chair. I think people need to realize (and I know a lot of people do) just because a manual wheelchair can do things, doesn't mean a power chair can. "Stupid shit" done in manual wheelchairs can be deadly with a power wheelchair. My mother sent me this link, with a motherly plea, “Please never do this!” But upon reading the article, it seemed as absurd to me as sending a plea to please not juggle grenades. Don’t take a power chair up an escalator? Yeah, I’m going to file that under ‘no shit.’

That said, the problems with elevators are serious and make a total mess of transit accessibility. When it comes to us wheelchairians in the Washington DC Metro area, the DC Metro Rail system has been so broken for so long, that many of us have come to expect the elevators in those stations to not work.

This man may have thought just that, and took his chance with the escalator. This is such an unfortunate tragedy... Here is the the article for anyone locked behind the paywall.

Man in wheelchair dies after falling down escalator at Columbia Heights Metro station
Spokeswoman says video shows the man waiting 10 to 15 seconds for the elevator before moving to the “up” escalator.

A man died after his motorized wheelchair fell down an escalator at Columbia Heights Metro station Wednesday afternoon, the transit agency said.

Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said that the man was using a wheelchair on the “up” escalator. She said he had nearly reached the top when he and the chair tumbled backward to the bottom.

D.C. Fire spokesman Doug Buchanan said the man was found unconscious at the bottom of the escalator, and was transported to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. He later died.

Ly said that Metro is not releasing his name, pending notification of his next of kin. His age is not known.

The station’s elevator was operating properly at the time, Ly said.

“A review of camera footage revealed the man waited 10 to 15 seconds for the elevator, which was in service at the time, and then diverted to the escalator,” Ly said. “Upon reaching the top of the escalator, the man and wheelchair fell backward, landing at the bottom.”

The video footage of the incident is not being released, Ly said.

“Several bystanders and the station manager immediately rendered aid until medics arrived,” she said. “The man was transported to a hospital where he was pronounced deceased.”

Of the major transit systems in the country, Metro is considered one of the most easily navigable for people with disabilities. Because its stations were built in recent decades — compared with stations in New York City or Boston, some of which are a century old — they are all equipped with elevators to enable people who rely on wheelchairs to use the system. And according to Metro’s most recent performance report, elevator availability for the last fiscal year, from July 2017 to June 2018, was 97 percent.

Still, people with disabilities have said that those numbers do not reflect their experience, and they become exasperated when they repeatedly encounter elevators that are not operating properly.

“They do shuttles!”
I’m at the end of the green line. There is no other B/S/O line transfer point. I have to go to work *every day*. 

They’ve taken over an hour to GET a shuttle every time a friend has needed one. You expect me to trust that for my daily commute?

Some suggested on social media that perhaps the man in Wednesday’s incident had assumed that he had encountered another broken elevator.

“Incredibly tragic,” Anthony LaMesa wrote on Twitter. “This man was likely so inured to #WMATA elevators being broken that he just assumed it would never come.”

Incredibly tragic. This man was likely so inured to #WMATA elevators being broken that he just assumed it would never come.

A similar incident occurred in Boston’s "T" in 2012, when a woman in a motorized wheelchair attempted to use an escalator to go to the upper level of a Red Line station. Her wheelchair made it only a few feet from the ground before it tipped over, causing her to somersault several times before she was helped by fellow passengers and a station employee who stopped the escalator.

The woman was not seriously injured, according to the Boston Globe. Manual chair user. I've done this a few times just for the stupid thrill, but the last time scared me straight. Someone came on behind me, and I could feel my grip weakening halfway up. Made it, but never again. Don't wanna die or make anybody else catch me on the way down. Exactly. I saw “elevator working at that station” and “power wheelchair” and thought nope nope nope. This was common sense preventable. I sympathize but it takes 30 seconds to check the elevator is out of order before you take a few hundred pounds of machinery up an escalator with you. 

I occasionally ride escalators when necessary in my manual chair too but you’ve got to be able to assess limits. You too, huh? I also had family members calling me in hysterics -\_\_-

\*edit for spelling agreed. my worst part of spending time in NYC was non-functioning transit elevators. sometimes, I'd have to reverse course halfway through my trip because I couldn't get to the necessary platforms.

did your mom send you the reddit link or one to the WaPo article? just curious. WaPo (lol, my mom redditing. Never)
