A wheelchair made from carbon fibre, currently being sold in the UK, is trying to reach it's kickstarter fund so that it can get FDA approval and entry in to the US.  Awesome! Shared it on Facebook. Is this your project? Hi! Thank you for sharing!

It's actually my step-fathers project. He has been working on it for a good few years now and with some financial backing it's finally starting to lift off the ground in the UK. There is a website as well if you would like to know more! :)
