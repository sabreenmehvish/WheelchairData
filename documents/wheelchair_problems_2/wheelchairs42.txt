Man in wheelchair stops in front f bus when operator would not let him on.  I honestly thought, since the Bay Area's so famous for disability rights, it would have good transit for people with disabilities. Then I sat in freezing temperatures for over an hour in San Francisco while four buses picked up able-bodied people and refused me. Not even an abnormal occurrence. I'm glad someone's standing against it, so to speak. This hurts my heart.
