What is this bar for?  Gives you a place to plant your foot so you can tilt the chair backwards. "curb climber" My initial thought was a rollover guard but I can tip it all the way back and it never reaches the ground.  The other reply is right. It is a step so a caregiver can lift up the front end over bumps.
