Market research for class project Hello [/r/wheelchairs](http://www.reddit.com/r/wheelchairs)! I am a student at University of California, Berkeley and am doing a class project on wheelchairs. If you have a moment to contribute to our market research, please help us by filling out this 10-question [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/D52RSLZ)!

Though some of these questions might be more applicable towards manual wheelchair users, all input is appreciated. If you or someone you know is in a wheelchair, we would love to see your responses. Or if you have any feedback, comments, or questions, just let us know here or in a pm. Thanks! done.  Hi, I'm English and in a powerchair but I did my best to respond.

One quick thing to note. There is one question about medical insurance that has an "other" option for you to write in the box. I chose other and wrote my experiences but when I tried to submit, it refused to let me proceed. I went back and was forced to check one of the options as the "other" space was a textbox, there was no "tick" option for "other" and that means you have to tick an option that is wrong for the "other" option to work...

I ended up ticking "Medicare" just so I could submit. This may skew your results! Thanks! We really appreciate it! Thanks for filling out the survey! And sorry for that bug. I'm a SurveyMonkey newbie, but will try to fix it.

We'll look at all the results individually and be sure to note your issue there.
