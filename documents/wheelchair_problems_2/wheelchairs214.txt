Clothing shopping for people in wheelchairs 
Hey, I'm a master student in digital media program at Georgia Tech. My group are working on a class project aiming to improve shopping experience of people using wheelchairs. In order to understand our user groups better, we want to do a research about difficulties people using wheelchair might meet. Would you like to help us fill the questionnaire! Thank you so much.
