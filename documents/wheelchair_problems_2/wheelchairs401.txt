Sucks to try and get a cab in New York. See how hard it is for this guy in a wheelchair. (Video)  That really freaking sucks and I know the pain. I take a service similar to access-a-ride, but I live in a town of ~70,000 people. Yet I have to be picked op 2 hours early to get to my first class on time and they have to pick me up in the afternoon an hour after my last class ends, and sometimes it can be up to an hour late. That adds another 4 hours onto my day that exhausts me. I take it because I pay $50 anyways as part of my tuition for an unlimited bus pass (which this service takes as well) and paying $15 for a cab ride just isn't in this student's budget. The issue is, you gotta call and book a ride at least 2 days in advanced (which kills any sort of spontaneity) and service ends at 5pm, which kills any sort of social life.

I recently totally got fed up with relying on a half assed service (the service is great, but waaay too understaffed) or asking other people for rides (I feel so bad asking because I ask so often), so I dumped 1200 on driving lessons. It was a lot, but one of the best decisions I've ever made. Now in 2 weeks I am set to do my road test and hopefully get a car sometime in the near future. 

My point is, public transit for most people in wheelchairs is horrible. If there is even a chance you might be able to drive, ask your doctor. I wasn't sure myself, neither was my doctor, but he passed my medical exam anyways (he knew that if I was a danger to the road, I would know it and not proceed with even trying further). But my lessons are going great and I will be driving myself around before the end of the year. Must be even worse in bad weather. That's what a colleague of mine does.  He's in a wheelchair but he has his own modified van that he drives so that he doesn't have to rely on public transit.  I wish good luck to you.
