Tire Suddenly Went Completely Flat. Why? Last week I got new tires for my wheelchair (I ended up going with air tires even though I had previously had solid rubber tires). I had wheelchair technicians to put them on. This morning I was rolling down a hallway at my university and my tire suddenly deflated. I checked it and I didn't run over anything sharp and I refilled the tire and it seems to be holding air fine. 

Does anyone know what might have happened or if I should return these brand new tires? If there are no leaks in the tire, the air could only have come out through the valve. Is the cap twisted on the valve? Could there have been something that lodged into the valve? Why did you end up going with air tires even though you had previously had solid rubber tires? I currently ride on solid tires, and can't imagine wanting to switch back to air. It ended up being a faulty valve because it happened again today, so I went in to get it serviced.

I had to go with air because they told me that the company stopped making the solid tires for my wheels. I'm not sure how accurate that is (the medical equipment store I go to is kinda a joke) but I did want to try air tires anyways because I wanted something with a bit more tread for the snow, plus they are noticeably lighter. But I guess I shall see if they are worth the headache.  I definitely get the tread on the snow issue. Definitely an advantage to have the air tires with the snow and ice. I havent looked into a new pair of solid tires lately, but they gotta still make them right? If not, looks like we should open up shop!
