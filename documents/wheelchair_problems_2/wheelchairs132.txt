Wheelchair and Rain: Update A few weeks ago, [I asked here if rain was a problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/wheelchairs/comments/78gou5/rain_and_wet_legs/). You told me clearly that it was. So, I am working hard on developing a solution. I hope to have it ready by spring. 

In the meantime I need more information from you. It will help me to develop this product and may lead to some new ones in the future. 

I know you get asked to complete many surveys, but if rain is an issue for you, please take **2 or 3 minutes** to complete **[this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/OQzlmp5j19u2nBjh2)** and I will help you out with some solutions.
 This sounds like a great idea! What about a side guard that had a pull over type thing that you can just grab and then pull over to the other side guard to help with rain. I️ think about this a lot actually because I️ use a manual wheelchair, I️ live in oregon(a rainy state) and I️ go to college for product design currently and it is hard to come up with a product that works well and looks good. If it looks too dorky or nerdy it is hard to get people to try it because we already stand out I️ public(no pun intended). Good luck!  Yeah. It retracts into The side guard.  It would clip to the other side.  I work for a wheelchair company and we often tell people with power chairs to go to MEC or an outdoors store and get a back pack rain cover to use for the electronics on the back of their chair (large backpacking back pack). For personal rain protection they're on their own. lol. You sound like an interesting person to know! Product design and wheelchair knowledge combined is very interesting. Did you fill out the survey? If so, there is a place where I ask if people want to be product testers. I would be interested to stay in contact.

But frankly, I don't understand your idea about the pull over type thing attached to the side guard. Are you thinking about something that rolls up in the side guard or something? So, it would be like a canopy that rolls up into the side guard and goes over the head of the wheelchair user? What keeps it up? Thanks for the tip. We work mostly with manual wheelchairs and I know  next to nothing about electric wheelchairs. Are the electronics always on the back of the chair? It would clip to the other side.  I understand it clips to the other side. But it has to go over the person's head, right? What keeps it up? No. It just goes over the waist.
