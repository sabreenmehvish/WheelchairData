Looking for a few people to take a very quick survey about how y'all feel about your bodies Hi everyone, I am a college student with a disability who is interested in how disabled people feel about their bodies. I have a very short survey with a few questions about bodies and gender in relation to disability and would love it if a few of you guys would fill it out. All responses will be anonymous and will be used in my final project for a class about 'embodiment'. 
here's the survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc00fRg-zQUg4WVUwC3KJY4qf60__rz9ZLKldP_8g6525v_Og/viewform?usp=sf_link#responses
Thanks everyone! Thank you very much to those who participated, the survey is now closed!
