ADA building requirements? Hi, 

I'm writing a paper on how accessible my apartment is and another building I frequent and cannot find the requirements. I've tried looking at www.ada.gov but their website is confusing. What I need are things like the size of the doorway, if there needs to be a kick plate, etc.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you! Have you checked out this PDF (http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm) on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design? That may cover some of your questions.  /u/squiiints pointed out the 2010 ADAAG, which covers public accommodations and government buildings.

A different set of laws would cover your apartment building (in particular, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation act and the Fair Housing Act).

Your state would likely have some additional accessibility rules for your apartment building.
