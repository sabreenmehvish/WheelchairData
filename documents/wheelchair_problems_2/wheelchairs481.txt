Help with Batteries Hi,

I'm looking into purchasing a second-hand wheelchair.  It seems to be a Wheeltech Energie+, which has two battery boxes.  From what I understand/have read it seems to use 85ah batteries.  What I would like to know is:

- Would this run off just one battery?
- Is it possible to use a 'lesser' battery (i.e. 2x 55ah)?

Hope someone is able to provide a little insight here.  I'm used to self-propel wheelchairs, however circumstances have forced me into getting a powered chair, and second-hand is my only option currently. Most wheelchair electronics are wired to handle only one size of battery so dropping down to a 55ah battery won't work. Also, you must replace both batteries at the same time. If you replace only one, the old battery will kill the new one quickly. The electronics are designed to run at 26v-22v and will require both batteries to be in good condition to operate.  A lower amp hour battery will work, but the lifespan will be significantly less. I wouldn't dog with anything less than 65ah batteries for any type of 24v power chair. 

It will not run off one, since the batteries are run in series.
