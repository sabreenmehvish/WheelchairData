Covering sharp edges/wheelchair hacks help Hey everyone! I wonder if anyone could point me in the right direction please. I support someone who has recently got a new motorised wheelchair and it's great. However, once the footplate is removed, the edges of where it slots in become quite sharp since they're metal. They aren't so sharp that they would cut her but I'd imagine uncomfortable if she knocks against them. Are there any ways to cover these? Also, I'm in the U.K. if it helps for stockists etc. Thanks!  why are we taking the footplate off? Shouldn't it flip up, or rotate to the side? It does rotate to the side - previously she had two feetplates but this is one long solid one and it is proving very difficult to lift and hold her feet and legs to clip it back into place. Also she likes it off when she is at her desk as she can't fit her feet underneath well (the plate gets in the way). She has it on unless she is, for example, sitting during the evening for the last hour or so before bed and is using her computer/desk. Any tips/accessories other than covering with like a sock or something?
