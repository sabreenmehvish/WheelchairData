Does anyone know where I could get free wheels? I have a Quickie GTX that I bought used as a backup for my forever-on-the-fritz power chair. However, the wheels that came with it were really bad and on one of them, the quick-release push-bar thing literally fell apart today and the wheel is kind of just held on by friction. Is there a place where I could get free parts for a manual chair? I'm on SSI and even used wheels on eBay are out of my price range. Free is tough, rims are expensive. Will your insurance not do anything?
 If you have a local chapter of [Easter Seals](http://www.easterseals.org/) , they may be able to help...I know seveal people that have been able to get donated equipment/parts from them. Not free but there are usually cheap ones on craigslist. I don't think so. They didn't cover the original chair and my regular one is a power chair, not a manual. Womp womp. I should contact them then, thanks!
 I'll look in my area again. I don't think people are selling wheels individually but maybe I could put out an ad.
