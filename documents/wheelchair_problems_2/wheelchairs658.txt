Looking for Certified ATPs in the Atlanta Area Does anyone know any online resources that can help me find someone with an Assistive Technology Certification? My mom has a permobile that needs to be repaired.  RESNA. google it. Repairs are usually done through a company the ATP works for, like National Seating and Mobility or Numotion. The previously mentioned companies are national companies and should have locations in your area. There may also be independent affiliates in your community as well. Use the RESNA website to look for ATPs in you area to contact. The site lists ATPs that are members of RESNA and often their contact info and company. If you call Permobil, they can hook you up with a rep or at the very least let you know who is closest to you that can make the repair.
