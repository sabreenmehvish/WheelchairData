is it a real wheelchair or nope?  Not everyone who uses a wheelchair has complete paralysis. I would expect people in THIS subreddit to understand that better than most.  Definitely a real wheelchair. I have about as much function as this guy. Doesn't make my chair use any less real, I just can't go walking around the block. definitely a real wheelchair, definitely an AB I like the shelf on the underside nice
Shame he fell poor guy I can move fast too wouldn't do me much use though but there are a million different things can be wrong he clearly has more strength on one side
As others have pointed out its not just paralysis and missing limbs muscle weakness from many syndromes and things we probably can't even think of can nessatate the need for a chair
We have all had terrible things said to us so let's try best cool and give others the benefit of doubt  that is 15 seconds from a persons' long day, i'd be quick to question their struggle.  you can see how quickly he moved his leg out to stop him from skinning his knee. maybe not AB totally. but, that was fast.
