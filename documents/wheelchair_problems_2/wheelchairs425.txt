Please advise best physical therapy place around Baltimore, MD Dear Community,

I looking for a good physical therapy place in an area between Columbia and Baltimore, MD. Ideally, if they  accept  CIGNA POS. 

Thank you in advance. What do you need therapy for? Different places have different specialties.  Sorry for the delay with answer. This is for my wife, she's paraplegic. She had no any therapy since 2012 and I want to fix this gap somehow. I'm not sure what kind of therapy is available here, however back in Europe she had some special rehab sessions where special trained staff worked with her, like special exercises, massage and so on... Depending on exactly where you live the two best are: University of MD Rehabilitation and Orthopedic Institute (used to be called Kernan) in Woodlawn/Catonsville area or Medstar National Rehabilitation Hospital in D.C.  There is one more in Baltimore....Kennedy Krieger International Center for Spinal Cord Injury. They only treat children in their hospital, but they see all ages in their outpatient department.  First one is, literally, around the corner. Thank you very much for help!

/Yevgeny Yeah, I know this place. They are really good, however they charge me $200/visit as facility fee... When my wife was applying for new wheelchair, these guys did great job with seating evaluation and letters to the insurance, however it's too expensive to pay such money every visit...
