4 Types of Wheelchairs That are Currently Available. (list is incomplete, lets complete it.)  "Wheelchairs for Cerebral Palsy"? Why do we get singled out? I feel like whoever wrote this list was poorly informed. People with other disabilities use more supportive wheelchair seating system (IE higher quadriplegics) and some people with CP that use wheelchairs (like myself) have enough trunk and arm function to use wheelchairs similar to what they describe as "mobility wheelchairs". 

I'd be more inclined to list 5 different types, each with a few sub-types: 1. Transport wheelchairs (like those seen in hospitals or those inexpensive wheelchairs directed for short term use which are meant to be pushed by an assistant - IE the wheelchairs you see at airports). 
2. Power Wheelchairs
3. Manual wheelchairs (divided into folding and rigid)
4. Specialty/sport wheelchairs
5. Paediatric wheelchair (though you could argue this fits into a number of categories above)

Maybe I'd add a 6th, something like experimental wheelchairs.  Yea this list is terrible! Iâ€™d even add an ultralight.
