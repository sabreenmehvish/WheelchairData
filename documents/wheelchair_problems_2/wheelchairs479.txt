Help Choosing between a Permobile F3 and a Quickie 646SE. I am in the process of getting a new wheelchair through vocational rehab, and the final choice comes down to these two powerchairs. I've had a Quickie 646SE for almost ten years and the thing is a friggin' tank, so I am leaning towards it. However I am getting contrasting reviews and recommendations from my physical therapists, and wheelchair technicians. 

The Permobile looks great and apparently comes very highly recommended, but the technicians I spoke to heavily suggested they are more of a hassle to fix and more expensive than the American Quickie. On the other hand, despite my preference for Quickie, I have been told that they haven't really done anything to improve their designs, loosing ground to competitors, and have actually lost many of their engineers to startups or other brands. 

I am looking for any sort of helpful review that will allay my fears of getting what will be my wheelchair for the long term. Thank you. I have now my second permobil and I am pleased with it... And I definitely pusted it to the limit a few times. My technican tells me that other brands are more likely to break.
I guess you can say they are the Mercedes under the power chairs As a vendor, the permobil is my preference. I find it hard to believe it's harder to work on, it's newer but very tech friendly and easilly expandable down the line. Thanks for the reply! How do you feel about repair times and costs with the Permobil? I know it must be hard to answer without a comparison you've been exposed to, but thought I'd ask anyway. Mh i live in Germany so the bill goes directly so the health insurance. I think they want the same money for there service. Repair handels my local medical service so also not compatible.
