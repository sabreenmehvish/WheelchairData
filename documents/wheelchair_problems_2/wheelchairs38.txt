Am I the only one irritated with... The new movie "Me Before YOU' I don't why but it just bugs me. People act like it some grand gestur to fall in love with a disabled person. Its a grand love story but in real life dating for those who are disabled is not that simple and not filled with people eager to date. To be honest I would be more impressed with the movie if they hired an actually disabled man/actor to play the part No. It's a thing many people are upset about:

We don't have light sabers, flying exoskeletons, norse gods, worm holes, or alien technology either. Emilia Clarke is easy to look at and fun to watch. Sure, they could have found a tetraplegic but do you think people would watch a movie with a guy who can't dress well or deliver lines because of breathing apparatus? I haven't seen it but I've heard nothing but bad things about it- making disability seem worse than death. Oh that's great!
