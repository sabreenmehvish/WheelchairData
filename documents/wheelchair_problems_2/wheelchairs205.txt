Are you still in a wheelchair in your dreams? Im always walking around as "normal" in my dreams!  Me neither. I've been in a wheelchair since '94 and I've never had a dream where I'm not walking. The best ones are when I dream I'm peeing. Holy sh*t those are awesome. (Is that weird?). My brother has been in a wheelchair since the 90's. He still walks around in all his dreams. Same here, I can always walk in my dreams. It's a bit of a letdown when I wake up. I’m always walking around in my dreams.   In the best ones I’m either running or swimming but I’m gonna have to think about peeing now! never walked in my life but i'm always walking in my dream. only time i didn't was when i had a dream about wheelchair basketball. so weird. I've been in a chair for 12 years. the first time i had a rolling dream was a couple years ago around my 10th anniversary. 

Interestingly, in that first rolling dream, i came to face a stairway outdoors and my wheelchair instinctively started floating to get me up the stairs.

Since then, I have had more dreams in a chair but but i've had others where i'm walking around too. It's a mix. I have a lot of inaccessibility dreams, where I'm not able to get out of my chair that day and I'm stuck in soft earth, or my friends are all going to a party and it's up a cliff, or I fall over trying to balance on an ADA-incompliant ramp and everyone rushes over like "of course you need help, sweetheart, you're disabled!" and I'm surrounded by endless pitying faces.

Then I've had dreams where I'm walking around, or ones where I'm flying in my chair.
