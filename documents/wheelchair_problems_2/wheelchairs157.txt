Getting my first wheelchair soon. Any advice? I am currently using a folding wheelchair on loan and I really don't like it. It's very heavy and it doesn't have good grip outdoors. I don't know a whole lot about wheelchairs so I've been doing some research but it's pretty overwhelming, and I would prefer to get my information from people who aren't trying to sell me on their product.  

The office that is organising the fitting and home inspection is severely short-staffed, so I know they probably won't have a lot of time to talk to me about options, and they're the only option available to me. It would really help if I had a better idea of what questions to ask before I talk to them.  

I'm very interested to hear from anyone who has used power assistance devices as well.  

Oh, and anyone who has dogs. I feel like I need a third hand for the leash. Any tips? My dog is dealing with this whole thing like a champ, so there's that at least. I'm not sure what condition you have or your insurance/price point, but some general advice I can give of your options are

1.	Decide on a rigid or folding frame. Both have advantages and disadvantages. People often say rigid is more for the user, folding is more for the care-giver. Rigid frames are more beneficial to active users as they are lighter, look nicer and less can go wrong with them. However, they, obviously, do not fold up for transporting it. You can take the wheels and fold down the back often, and, if you get good at it (and become a Tetris master) you can do it fairly quickly and fit it in almost any back seat. Folding frames, obviously, fold, so they can be easier to transport, but because there are more components, they tend to be bulkier and more can go wrong with them.

2. Material. This is mostly dependent on your price range. Most wheelchairs are aluminum, which is your standard. It’s cheaper, but a bit heavier, but durable. If you have the need or the option to go for something lighter like titanium or carbon fiber, there are options. I love my titanium wheelchair, but every pound was	a factor for me, so it was worth the dramatic price increase 

Other random suggestions I have is, since this is your first chair, you want a good fit, but you also want some adjustability, so try to get something that you can adjust the center of gravity and the dump (the angle at which the seat sits).


As for dogs. I know there are bike attachments like these that can help http://www.biketowleash.com/accessories.php
But when I was taking care of my grandmother’s dog (granted, she is a tiny, yappy thing), I just put her on a retractable leash and put the plastic thing under my leg. 
 Can't help with the power part, but I use a TiLite XRA, and love it. First chair that is comfortable for me. Regarding the dog, you will have to work with them. Use the same length leasch, don't get a retractable one. I found 4ft was perfect. Just train them to not pull on the leash, and you'll be able to loop it on your wrist and roll like normal. I owned my 50 lb English Bulldog before and after the injury, and she was low to the ground and literally a muscle with legs, but I could still control her after working with her.

Common things I see with people that have been in chairs for a while: get the lowest back you can, you need to maintain your core. Handles on the back sucks, as people try to push you. No handlebars in the front, no seatbelt. Lose the wheelie bars as soon as you're comfortable with it. That is my 2 cents at least.. Get measured and go as lightweight as you can afford.  do not get solid tires.  Rough on the back.  I use a top end terminator titanium.  No issues for years.  Also have spinergy rims.  Lightweight!
 Hope I'm not to late, I'm a TiLite TRA user, full titanium and super light edition with spinergy wheels, ADI Rides carbon fiber back rest and ride forword cushion. I'm a c6/c7 quad and pushing has never been easier, I love the extra support on the frame and it makes the chair lighter rather then the open frame.

I have a 10 year old 75lb husky and what I do is use a normal leash, I put the wrist strap around the right push handle on my chair. It was super frustrating at first but then it got better as he got used to the idea, not helps me by pulling when I need him to. And questions just ask. I have EDS and orthostatic intolerance due to autonomic dysfunction and a bunch of other fun stuff.  

Yeah, I would like to be able to lift it in and out of the car without help so I can be more independent.  

I'll definitely look into adjustability. Thanks for letting me know!  

How much difference does a few kilos/pounds make when you have a better wheelchair? I've only ever used 15kg folding ones.  

Those leash attachments look pretty cool, thanks. Handles on the back rock! Much easier to carry extra backpack or lunch bag. Poeple won't just try and push you, at least not that I've found. Most folks respect personal boundaries. If they don't then it wouldn't matter if you're in a chair or not.

Post feedback in /r/ToMetric") I like the look of the TiLite chairs. Is there a reason you like the XRA over the other models?  

My dog is 40kg or so, but thankfully he is really good with his heeling. The worst thing he does is stop in the middle of a walk to zone out and stare up at the sky. He's weird.  

Wheelchairs have handlebars? and seatbelts? :s  
Do I need the anti-tip things to start off with or could I just... not?  
Is the low back comfy though? I have terrible posture.  

Thanks for your advice! What type of tyres do you recommend? I don't know much about tyres, just that the ones on my hire chair suck on gravel and paved paths. I guess that's the grip though.  

I've seen the spinergy rims as an option. Is there a practical reason for getting them? They look cool.

Thanks for your advice! Not too late at all!  

Thanks for the info. :)  
Do you find the dual tube frame makes a noticeable difference compared to the mono tube? The terminology is all new to me, so I see that it looks different, but I don't know what it changes from a user perspective.  

I'd love to see my dog if he was asked to pull my chair. I can't even get him up in the mornings unless he really needs to pee.  
Do you mean you tie the leash to your chair? Luckily my bars raise up enough I can hang a bag on them. I live in Indiana where hospitality is ingrained from a young age, so I get too helpful people lol. That's handy to know, thanks! Sorry, had a little typo in my original, I use the ZRA. In my case, this particular chair had been ordered by someone else in my exact measurements, but they had never picked it up and it was gathering dust in his office, so I got a great deal. I like the ZRA as it's very lightweight, absorbs a ton of shock, and is easy to collapse for the car.

Chairs can have handlebars, but they only got in my way during rehab. The anti-tippers are the wheeliebar things I mentioned, seatbelt are for people that lack trunk comtrol. The lower the back you can use safely, the better. Easier to start lower now, then start high and try and work down IMO. I originally had a pair of wheelie bars, but I haven't had them on in over a year now, they interfere with curbs Just make sure they are pneumatic. I roll on primo treaded now. I had the super expensive schwalbe and found that they actually caused tube blowouts.  i use regular street wheels.  not the knobby off road tires.  Spinergy are very lightweight and strong.  and yes, they look really cool. :)
 yeah so the only difference feel is a lighter chair. other wise the extra tubes make the chair stronger for when you bump into things, the frame bends less. i use to have a mono tube TiLte aero z, hate it compared to the tra.

hah my dog just ttakes off some times. and yes to keep him tied up so i can use both hands and arms freely, it also keeps the leash just high enough so it dosnt tangle the wheels or casters. Haha, that's fine. Score on the cheap chair! Sounds awesome.  

Ahh, okay. I already do small stairs and stuff without any, but I guess I'll have to learn all over again with a new chair so maybe I need them. I'll see if they have one with a low back to try out. Thanks for the info! Pneumatic... are just air? Do they require a lot of maintenance?  
Thanks for the info! Oh okay. Do you find the street wheels okay for hitting the odd patch of grass or gravel path? How about getting up curbs?  
They look easier to keep clean than the heavy tread so I would prefer them.  

Haha. I definitely haven't been playing with the colour configurator on the TiLite website to make a matte black Batchair with yellow spinergy spokes. Definitely not. :) Thank you so much for answering my questions!  

Haha. Yep. I haven't been tying my dog to my chair in case he decides he suddenly wants to cross the road or something. D:   Yup, like bicycle tires. Besides airing them up now and again very little maintenance.  Yeah  they are pretty durable.  i wish i could have murdered out my chair when I ordered it so many years ago. Ahh, okay. Thank you! Awesome!  

Yeah, I figure I may as well make it as fun as possible if I have to wait all this time and probably spend a lot of money on it anyway.
