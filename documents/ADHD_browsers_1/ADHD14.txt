Apps for lists and organizing? Wondering if people have any recommendations for apps for keeping to do lists and grocery lists? I used to use Habitica but I'd like to be able to have lists in different categories. I use todoist. Its both available as an app an in browser, so i can use it everywhere.

You can add tasks easily, you can sort them under projects and... schedule them in later. For me this is ideal cause that way i don't have to decide on the spot when i will do something like you would need to do in a google calendar. Ussually its not the task itself that causes stress but the pressure to already plan it long ahead.

Its also easy to reschedule tasks, so even if i fail to complete a task it remains on my radar that way and it eventually gets done.

I would recommend it over many other tools i have tried!

 I use Google Keep Thanks! I've used it for a couple of days now. Seems really good and I like that you can have different tags for lists. Nice to hear that its working out :)
