Organizational Tools for ADHD I want to get a list of all the different tools people use for organizing themselves.

Personally I've love a suite of tools that works on both mobile and web browser.

For example I've been using [Out Of Milk](http://outofmilk.com) for a while now for my grocery list, it works both from the browser and from a mobile phone. I like bullet journaling. It's less convenient than mobile apps but I like being able to write and plan things out without any limitations. I also like how it's totally customizable. There's a format they recommend you follow but it's pretty bare bones IMO and you can easily change things to suit your needs or what works for you. It's like organization for the disorganized lol. Habit tracker games, apps and pieces of paper near an unavoidable calendar also look useful.

I'm tracking some things on a calendar, and look to be starting habit cards when I get home from being
someone else's body double.

You know what else is good? Body doubles and accountabilibuddies.
