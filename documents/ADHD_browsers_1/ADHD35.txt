Studying (or other things) APP recommendation: Forest (also a browser extension) So the last time this app was posted was a while ago from my search so I want to put it out there again and say that it has grown quite a bit.

The app itself is called Forest: available on all IOS devices or other smartphone app stores.

You set a timer of your choice (you can pomo it with 25 minutes if you want) and start studying or doing whatever you need to do, when start, you **cannot** leave the app, if you do it kills the tree and you have to start over, however, if you stick it through you get points, you can start labeling your stuff with tags such as studying or sports or whatever.

It then also can graph your productivity with charts throughout the week and compare it with others globally or among your friends.

Here is the cool part: if you gain enough coins you can use it to plant a real tree somewhere in the world, the planting of the tree can raise the income of poverty stricken farmers by 400%! [Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PIRl9GsVMI)

The app costs 2 euros and is a life saver as a person with ADHD!

It can also help with socialising since you cannot use your phone as an escape.

Anyway, enjoy guys!

P.S: the browser extension of the app can help you blacklist certain websites so when you activate the app it stops you from using those sites till the timer runs out. You're a lifesaver.

Exams will be much less of a hell to study for now Always a pleasure :)
