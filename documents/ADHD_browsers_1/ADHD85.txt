That's no moon...that's a FAQ page!  It's finally happened! I've just updated the sidebar with a link to /r/ADHD's [official FAQ.](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)

**The biggest thanks** goes out to community member PoundnColons who was awesome enough to write this FAQ for us. 

I also want to thank the various members of the community who have been messaging us in the past few months making recommendations for the FAQ and making sure we didn't forget about it. It is still very subject to revision, and all feedback is encouraged. If I personally told you that something was going to be in this and it isn't yet, well, feel free to remind me.

Edit: I've done this just as I'm running out the door, but I'll be back later to chat with people and maybe spruce the thing up a bit. Remember to mention anything you would like to see added or changed, you can message the mods via the subreddit or me through the gmail adress in the page description under the main header. It is open for all to freely edit however I will be monitoring it to make sure format is kept orderly, wording is clear, and information is correct. Thank you all for your input about what information you wanted to see and questions answered. Keep up the good work making this an awesome community! Don't forget to participate in the IRC chat linked in the side bar, it's a great opportunity to live chat with a lot of awesome people.  Nice!

I'd rephrase the myths and misconceptions section to avoid the familiarity backfire effect.  For example:

* calm people can have ADHD too
* ADHD affects both children and adults
 Nice one! Huzzah! Anyone who wants to add to it can message the mods an appropriate section or question/answer and it shall be done! Good work. I don't understand why it would be mistaken for a moon to begin with... I remember this time when i went to a doctor for a common flu. She ask me if i was taking any kind of pills and i say "yes, i take ritalin", she laugh and say "Really?, at 22?, that is for kids!".

Ritalin, Concerta, etc are for big boys too who still have ADHD.

Sorry for my bad english. "camparing"

"dopamin"

Please include info/links on patient assistance programs ([like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/otdx7/cayenne_pepper_helps_me_a_lot/c3k8kgu)) for those without prescription coverage.

â€¢ edit, and perhaps diet/exercise/supplement info, to minimize repetition of *those* threads? Thanks, man!  I've skimmed it a bit and I'm really liking what I see.  I'll try to give it a good readover soon.  Thanks again for doing this! A section on finding help in university, please! Any sources for more specific listing of side effects than WebMD's nearly generic ones?

Thanks! http://www.myadhd.com/treatment_tools/medicationchart.html

There is a "Contribute" link under the FAQ listing in the sidebar that just takes me to a blank page that tells me I don't have permission.

Thanks! :P Oh, sorry.  Have a look at [Part 2 of the Skeptical Science Debunking Handbook](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/12/27/392237/debunking-handbook-backfire-effect/) I was told this is usually due to privacy or ad-blocking add-ons. Try using a different browser or an incognito window. I have not yet verified that this works, but will try it myself tomorrow. Many thanks friend, I will be sure to get on this when I have time. I do have ABP.  idk what is an "incognito window." If you use Chrome or Firefox it is a seperate browser window for private browsing. It does not keep a history of what sites you visit or use any add-ons (in Chrome by default, Firefox does IIRC). I use this to test if an add-on is causing problems when websites error out. Private browsing (in firefox) did not change the issue, fwiw.

Thank you.
