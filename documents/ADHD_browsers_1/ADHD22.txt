Proving that even when given another chance in life, we still do the same shit over and over... I wish I could keep it to 23! My iPhone replaced 99 with :) after I hit 100 tabs; now I have no idea how many are open and my phone is mocking me.  Makes me wonder how many people with ADHD are also hoarders.  [deleted] Closing tabs accidentally bothers me way more than it should. Doesn't help that I keep about 30 or more open at a time. Thank god for google chrome and it's "reopen closed window/tab" option. My friends always got on me for my tabs and one time one of them closed all my tabs as a joke. Hate that feeling so much but I can't put it into words My dude, [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com) extension will change your life.
(as long as you don't procrastinate too terribly much and actually clean out saved tabs occasionally :U) Am I the only one who thinks they only have like 10-12 tabs, but realize they have like 4-5 other windows open with another 10-12 tabs each from several days ago? I actually read this as 230. These guys are amateurs. [Here's my ADHD battlestation at work.](http://imgur.com/J9EOFf0)  It's a shot from a couple years ago, but the setup is still pretty much the same. You mean it's not normal to have all these tabs open that I never ever close? The strict assumptions of the normal regression model are 
violated, because our primary dependent variables are 
skewed and only approximately continuous. Concentration 
and closeness are defined as continuous, though bounded. 
The number of ties, centrality, and size can only take on non-
negative integer values. Their ranges are quite large 
(approximately 70, 400, 120, and 3000, respectively), 
however, making the continuity approximation reasonable. 
While the truncation and skewness are potentially 
problematic, these features are shared by the independent 
variables, allowing us to make the a priori working 
assumption of symmetric disturbances. We confirmed the 
validity of this assumption with diagnostic plots in a post-hoc 
residual analysis (not reported here). Nonetheless, we 
checked the robustness of our results in several ways. First, 
we applied a square-root transformation to the dependent 
variables and reestimated the normal regression model. 
Second, for those dependent variables that are integer 
numbers, we also estimated panel models for count data. 
Third, there are two dependent variables that are constrained 
to the values of 0 and 1: MainComp and public. For these, 
we also ran panel models for binary outcomes (i.e., panel 
logit estimators). All three of the additional models confirmed 
the findings of the normal regressions. We report only the 
results of the normal regressions for all variables, to ease 
interpretation and allow comparison of effects across the 
models.  There should be a chrome extension that randomly closes all your tabs.  maybe that's why I subconsciously like using incognito mode, no restore.  I limit myself to five, it's a hard limit I've been using since... I'm old so since tabs were invented. Literally sitting in front of 26 tabs as I read this  :'c 

... with 6 other windows behind it that I'm too afraid to count If you hit CTRL+SHIFT+T right after you do this, Chrome will reopen the window you just accidentally closed, with all its tabs still there. The command is the same on Firefox, and I believe it works just as well. Challenge accepted. how can y'all use so many tabs? I have six open, and only three are open throughout the day (chatrooms). I have had a window open on the pegasus exploit for over a week that I haven't sat down to read, but most my tabs are short lived. I have one tab open on my phone.  Middle mouse button... [one tab](https://www.one-tab.com) changed my life  Feels like I'm in the minority here, but I rarely have more than 5 tabs open. I mean, to locate any website it would be quicker for me to search for it in Google than to scan through my open tabs, so I've never seen the use for opening many tabs. 23?  Not ADHD. But... But... Ctrl + Shift + T Holy shit this is so fucking real.

Just realised what sub I'm in. God damn it. CTRL + H Recently closed  I usually have like 2 windows open with 30 tabs each, and then I use linux... so multiple virtual desktops, and those workspaces have windows with tabs as well. I also run a VM on my machine and that will be running chrome with another 30 or 40 tabs or so. Only 23? I have more than that open in IE, which is intentionally set *not* as default, and *not* to remember tabs. It's my "I need to check something real quick, and don't want to open firefox, chrome, or opera, because each has over 200 saved tabs" browser. I usually close my tabs if I finish reading them -- if not, then they remain open. I'm usually kind of OK about reading whatever the hell it is, but I still will start with one, work my way up to 30-50 ish, then work my way back down in one browsing session... YUP. I panic and then hit this. Pfft, amateur hour over here. 

Ctrl-shift-T to restore closed tabs in chrome. Now you have 0.5 seconds extra for memes.  i have dozens of saved sessions with 150-250 tabs because that's when things start to slow down Relating to you so hard!!!! Like I just might need to look at them again... fml. if you're in Incognito mode on mobile Chrome, it says ";)" after 99. Don't ask how I found that out.

... and yes I did test it after reading this post and opened 100 tabs of google images, took a screenshot aaand now I can't be bothered to post it, 11 hours later. At this point when using the internet on my iPhone I make sure to bookmark anything I want to look at later and basically ignore tabs. Outta sight, outta mind.  I can't do my phone over ~10.  And my PC 20.  I get wigged out! I'd absolutely be some sort of hoarder if my wife didn't keep me in check. Currently my hoarding is contained within video games like WoW and Skyrim.  There are actually a lot of different disorders that can lead to hoarderism, my dad went on a kick researching it a number of years back.  deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9719  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/86533) It's a possible connection but I'd bet it has more to do with OCD, which probably directly correlates with ADHD itself. Meeee. It's emotionally draining for me to get rid of stuff. I'm always worried I'll need it one day Idk because I procrastinate on important tasks at least twice a month by decluttering, organizing and cleaning.  I have less than a hundred tabs open... on each of the three browsers I have up at the same time. FYI you can bookmark all open tabs at once. I do that if I am in the middle of a research jag, but have to leave.  All these things I had almost done.. poof.

I have dozens of tabs open on my laptop and a good few on my phone too. Sadly my phone is so old already it crashes sometimes and doesn't always remember what was open in Chrome. Like it goes to Google instead of the search results. Wtf did I google?!

Edit. How to spell poof. Ctrl+shift+T

Reopens closed tabs! OneTab is a lifesaver... But I have over 2000 saved tabs.  Yeah, I'm like "23? Amateur hour." Good lord. What's your job?

(Secretly wishing I had that kind of setup) deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1841  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/87779) And if that doesn't cut it for you, there's always Session Buddy.

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en Also Opera and Firefox. Command + shift + T on macOS. Same keystrokes work in Firefox. and dials 911 to report a heart attack. You have things like setting maximum tabs,

* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/max-tabs/?src=api
* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xtab/amddgdnlkmohapieeekfknakgdnpbleb

I guess you find similar extensions for other browsers too
 Fuck, my dad could use this  I'd prefer if it would randomly, secretly, close them one by one, so I wouldn't notice, and it would try to keep the tabs to a reasonable level.

Or some a list of tabs, displayed on the left, instead of on top, that would still work perfectly with 500 of them open. Same here, I'm a compulsive tab closer. Compulsive due to the amount of times I have to go back to my hsitory to reopen things I needed.. I have two open. and only one is constantly on when I'm at the computer, so people can get in touch with me. On my phone, I hate using the browser at all. and my apps are always closed when I'm done with them. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0683  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/14981) Mine are all named like "Come Back to This!!! #23"

I never go back to any of them for anything. I'm just doing a drive-by from /r/all but I regularly keep sessions greater than 300 tabs open. Here's [a plot of the number of tabs in my sessions for 2015](http://superkuh.com/number-of-tabs-vs-date.png). Using the Pale Moon browser keeps everything fast and memory consumption down (400 tabs and <3GB ram used). Every time I feel quite certain that this is an engaging topic that I will want to revisit in the futu--- 

Ooooo what is this other link we have here!?

Press/hold

Open in new tab

/end
 people underestimate incognito! i use it for everything: nothing worse than a phone constantly trying to finish your sentences.

Ironically i tried to google the verb for this and got diagnosing ADHD.... -.- I also have hundreds of bookmarks that I never look at, in addition to infinite tab action! On a related note, do you ever spend hours in some small cave trying to scavenge every little gold coin or loot?

I tend to also spend a lot of time looking around to see if I had missed a spot. I know skyrim can be a long game... but at the slow rate I'm moving I think it'll take a few years. Yeah I do this in RPGs too, but I think it's mostly because I can't be bothered to sort out my stuff This is one of the reasons I stopped playing WoW.  I just want to run some raids god damn it! Why do I need to spend 20 minutes in the auction house clearing my bags?? to be fair, you never know... I was a hoarder or things that looking important, or that could have a use, my wife compulsively throws things away during a cleaning binge. 

My wife found a random threaded plastic ring, i told her that looks like it belongs to something and that she should hold onto it until she realizes what it is. Pfft garbaged. 

1 month later: "Do you know where my pampered chef icing gun connector is?" You mean that threaded ring that i said to hold onto until you knew what it was, Yep... I do. IT Manager for a wholesale greenhouse.  I also manage our online marketing, social media, tours, educational outreach, instructional videos, etc. .... Basically, it is my dream job because I can indulge my ADHD by working on multiple projects.   My car keys are kinda hard to forget. My work keys however are a different story. I normally leave them on a hook in my office. However, I have forgotten them at home before. The bad thing is that I have a 45 minute commute. Nothing like a 90 minute round trip. Just wanted to second this, session buddy is a godsend is he adhd too or something else? UNTIL you need to prove one point to someone and you're like "hang on I have the source for that somewhere! let me scroll through all of these partially titled notes to see where I saved it at." spends the next hour looking for particular point and then forget to show that person.  wow is palemoon that good? i got over a hundred tabs on firefox and its murdering me with 16 gigs of ram that i got for shits and giggles I use Opera and I've managed around 1200 tabs with it still being usable; it's mostly that my laptop starts to get pretty warm and loud if I've got things from Twitter and Facebook open in the background. Opera also is good at just shrinking the tabs instead of pushing them off the edge of the title bar, like Chrome, or making them scroll, like Firefox. SwiftKey unfortunately still picks up words while in Incognito mode (like 75% of the time, the other 25% it does that "I can't even predict word" thing). It being awesome makes up for it though.

I'm not sure how there would be a verb for using incognito mode hahaha, sleuthing?? Nice Oh of course. I haven't finished a game in several years because I spend too much time on exploration and side quests afraid I'll miss something. Then I get bored of it because I'm not playing the main game and start up another game, continuing the cycle. It doesn't help that I'm obsessed with getting games on sale that I want to play eventually. At this rate I'll be catching up on gaming from beyond the grave. That sounds perfect. Project work is the way to go for me, too. no LOL a verb for compulsively trying to finish sentences/words, not sleuthing, though i do like that word now...

Edit: swiftkey isn't so swift... you can train it but for some reason it has moral superiority. years later i have so many typo's saved it isnt fit yet fuck still gets autocorrected to "duck".... Duck you swiftkey, you know what i wanted to say! 2 hours ago? I don't remember typing any of that... well I [found this article](http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2013/07/sentence-interruptus.html), please don't go too far down the rabbit hole!

Surprisingly I've not had that issue with SK. It spells all my swear and custom words just fine :\^) irritating would of been the word i'd chosen!

i get what info i need and close that shit, i'm pretty good at avoiding the rabbit hole when medicated :) ty for that!
