An aweome chrome browser extention that automatically close unused tabs  And [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/) is a Firefox add-on that let you block the distracting time-consuming websites (e.g. reddit) where you get stuck for hours and hours when you're supposed to get something important done. You can configure it to automatically block sites after you've spent a certain amount of time there, or block them during a particular time of the day etc. Commenting on this so I can come back on the computer....if I don't get distracted and forget. Thanks for sharing!
