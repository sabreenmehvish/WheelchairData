Homebrew suggestions for co-morbid drug interactions? Yes, I know "see a doctor" is the best option. I just had my insurance switched (Go USA) and my intake appointment is in *two months*. I'm hoping to get some pointers about not fucking my entire life up in that timeframe. 

I was put on 200mg ER Tegretol x2 daily for co-morbid bipolar days before my insurance switched. We haven't even touched the ADHD diagnosis or medications yet. I'm on 20mg Nortriptylene and 800mg x3 Ibuprofin for chronic pain (Opiates sucks and I stop being smart enough to do my job) 

It's been about a month, and I'm in hell. I hurt all day again, and I have completely lost my ability to trigger or maintain hyperfocus.  I'm sitting here shaking from how much caffeine I've taken and still cant do my work (I literally just tried, and have now found myself on reddit, typing this post) 

Impulse control wasn't even my big thing, but now I have none. Example, I have a site blocker on my browser. I turned it on yesterday to try and work. I tried working. Knowing all this, I repeatedly found myself staring bewildered at a blocked www.reddit.com

Then I was disrupted from browsing on my phone when the 25 minute blocker timer went off. 

So things are a little rough right now, and maybe one of y'all can give me some tips that aren't "See a doctor" (unless you got the hookup on someone who costs ~$0 and can take me this week). 

I'm gonna post this and enable the blocker again, see how far I get. Cheers. 

**tl;dr: list all non-medical solutions to medically exaggerated ADHD symptoms gogogo**

INB4 medical marijuana btw; I'd prefer to keep my sobriety date. 

INB4 "that's not how those drugs work" which is also the thing I hear a lot. I'm just calling it the way I see it. None of us have access to the mature neuroscience required to tell me definitively what is wrong. I hoping to hear solutions, not contradictions.
