[TT] When you find yourself with multiple browser windows full of tabs - stop! Select multiple tabs that relate to the subject you were browsing and then use 'bookmark all'. Bookmark them to folder with that subject name. This occurred to me earlier in the week when doing research for a report. I started getting anxiety once I had about 3 browsers open with 10 - 15 tabs each. 

I saved them into a folder structure like:
   
*University > M Degree> Class Name > Assignment Name*

Once I knew that all the pages I had been looking at were saved it was a huge stress relief. I closed all the browsers and found I could focus better on the report.  You've just changed my life. Thank you.  I've got the bookmark folders, but didn't realize they could be nested (why not? that's how every other folder I use works).  Thanks! Watch Later on Youtube and Firefox's Pocket feature are godlike for this.

I know I don't end up watching half the stuff I save, but it's really nice to have for when I need a break and it's a slow day in my subscriptions box. I can dive into the "ooooh I wanna see that" list and find new content whenever I need it. I do something similar, Ill look into somthing Im thinking about at the time, looking for infomation on it. I'LL find a site, then end up opening tab after tab on the subject, for an hour or two then burn myself out and forget what I was looking for when I started and end up getting nowhere. Awesome, you are most welcome and have a great day! Glad I could help! I've been trying to organize digital things recently like calendars etc, so this realisation was an extension of the initiative. Now I just have to stick to it! Yep, even if you're just looking at interests or a hobby. Then I sleep my laptop for days on end with the browsers open because "I don't want to lose those websites!"


I can also relate to your example of tab the rabbit hole leading to a nil outcome.
