ITT: We list the browser apps and extensions which help us best I'll start by posting a few that I have found to be immensely helpful (I use Chrome, but feel free to contribute extensions for other browsers).

- [TooManyTabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toomanytabs-for-chrome/amigcgbheognjmfkaieeeadojiibgbdp?hl=en): This extension allows you to suspend some of your tabs to clear up your top bar as well as to free up memory. It's great for getting tabs out of the way when you don't want to close them forever but you also don't want to bookmark them.

- [Better History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-history/obciceimmggglbmelaidpjlmodcebijb?hl=en): This extension is fantastic for organizing your browsing history to make it more readable and readily accessible.

- [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en): This is an absolutely wonderful extension that replaces your New Tab page with a customized page containing reminders and motivational quotes. It's aesthetically pleasing and keeps you on track.

- [Sidewise](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sidewise-tree-style-tabs/biiammgklaefagjclmnlialkmaemifgo?hl=en): This one's for those of us who open too many tabs and lose track of which is which (so pretty much all of us). The extension opens a slim window on the side of your browser, allowing you to quickly move through your various tabs and close them. An interesting feature (especially for us) is that it shows a parent tab and then tracks the child tabs opened from it. This could help you better understand your tangential searches.

- [iCloud Bookmarks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-bookmarks/fkepacicchenbjecpbpbclokcabebhah?hl=en): My bookmark collection is a horrid mess of mostly-empty folders named for specific topics, and it only gets worse when you divide it up between my iPhone bookmarks and desktop bookmarks. This extension allows you to sync bookmarks from iCloud and make them accessible on your computer.


If you would be so kind, please post what you like to use ITT so we may establish a go-to list of helpful items! Thanks for Momentum. Legit. I open two different browser windows, one for work and one for procrastinating. I've been using [be limitless](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/be-limitless/jdpnljppdhjpafeaokemhcggofohekbp?hl=en-US) as my new tab page, it looks to be very similar to momentum, only it shows me how I've spent my time online as well, and has bookmarks to frequently used sites (which I never use, but hey). 

I'm currently looking for a new tab page to remind me of tasks though when I get distracted and without having to input my todo list in multiple platforms. I was using wunderlist as my android/windows/chromebook to do list as it syncs/works with all but I'm trying out todoist now as it can integrate with sunrise calendar (which I also use as my main calendar on chromebook and my phone, so seeing deadlines and tasks in calendar view is nice. Wunderlist integration is apparently coming soon, though). But for wunderlist users, this [new tab page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wunderlist-new-tab/fgikemaeelgbhjnhnnahcpkjpafaeion?hl=en) may be handy, as it'll show your to-do list. 
[Taco](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/taco/aogabobfbepcehdkbfagdflinolncebh?hl=en) can apparently show to do lists from many services, include trello and todoist, so I may give it a whirl later today and report back.

Other extensions I love: 

* [Stayfocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) to limit time on sites or block me out entirely when I'm working.
* [Strict workflow](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd?hl=en) for pomodoro.
* [Checker Plus for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj?hl=en). I can easily delete, label, or mark emails as read from a popup.
* [Mightytext](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mightytext-sms-text-messa/dkfhfaphfkopdgpbfkebjfcblcafcmpi?hl=en-US) to compose/get/reply to texts, get notifications of incoming calls and low phone battery alerts (if you're like me and leave your phone in the other room a LOT, this is a godsend!). 
* [Pushbullet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pushbullet/chlffgpmiacpedhhbkiomidkjlcfhogd) is very similar to mightytext, but instead alert you of ALL phone notifications, which can be distracting (you can mute any/all you want to, though). Also, while mightytext will also alert my nexus tablet (which has the app for tablets installed) when I get a text and let me reply, pushbullet doesn't. I do love pushbullet for sending stuff from my browser to my phone and tablet, though.
* [Easybib tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/easybib-tools/hmffdimoneaieldiddcmajhbjijmnggi?hl=en-US) for citation help.
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) for more citation help (as easybib doesn't do ASA and I need it for some upper level classes for my Sociology major).
* Wunderlist and Todoist have various extensions as well, including those that integrate with gmail, so if you use either and use chrome, that may be worth checking out.


And for fellow chromebook users, lemme hit you up with some apps I love!:

* [Timedoser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timedoser/cmkneeaihlcdllananjlkmppnkdahdcc?hl=en) to divide up your time/pomodoro technique/what have you. Alternatively, you can use [Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/hhclmngbkkejbdfjmicnkmoggfpehein?hl=en-US) and manually set up alarms in that, too. 
* [Sunrise calendar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sunrise-calendar/mojepfklcankkmikonjlnidiooanmpbb?hl=en) to sync with android and/or ios calendars (and to just be prettier/more integrated with services like trello and todoist than standard google calendar).
* To do lists: I need to just pick one and roll with it but I'm admittedly shuffling between [Todoist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/todoist-to-do-list-and-ta/jldhpllghnbhlbpcmnajkpdmadaolakh?hl=en), [Wunderlist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wunderlist-for-chrome/ojcflmmmcfpacggndoaaflkmcoblhnbh?hl=en), [Workflowy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/workflowy/koegeopamaoljbmhnfjbclbocehhgmkm?hl=en), and [Trello](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello/oflhioojkbelepjlnafgmgkkjhojphcg?hl=en-US) to see what works best for me across platforms (for me, that's between an android phone and tablet, chromebook, and windows 8 desktop). Trello isn't exactly a to-do list per se but I need to break down my tasks into smaller tasks and it can help organize them in a different way than other to-do clients?
* [Evernote]( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/evernote/dhfolfjkgpeaojbiicgheljefkfbbfkc?hl=en-US ) is AMAZING for note taking and then reviewing on the go on my tablet or phone. And I really like how [Carddesk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/carddesk-beta/dcnogbkhgiehkecklomiedldanmoaecg/related) displays all my evernote stuff. I want it on all my other devices now!
* I use [Google keep](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-notes-and-lis/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki) more for quick notes and reminders, and evernote more for notes for class. But I can see how you could also use Keep for that, and the more I use it, the more handy I'm finding it for across platform use.
* When wifi is down and I can't get to evernote web for class notes, I'll either use keep, google docs (need to [enable offline mode first](http://blog.laptopmag.com/how-to-activate-google-docs-offline-on-your-chromebook) to use em offline though!), [Writebox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/writebox/bbehjmjchoiaglkeboicbgkpfafcmhij?hl=en), or [Calmly Writer](http://www.calmlywriter.com/) (offline capabilities only work with the paid version, heads up) and then copy-pasta them in evernote later. *edit: realized I had Web only Evernote and not the app with offline capabilities too installed so this will be a moot point in the future! Also updated that Evernote link above to the one with offline capabilities. But last two apps are also really great for distraction-free writing as well! Sometimes you just gotta turn off the wifi and word vomit to get cracking on a paper.*
* I personally LOVE [google inbox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inbox-by-gmail/pkclgpgponpjmpfokoepglboejdobkpl?hl=en-US) to help keep my email organized. 
* [Easybib](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/easybib/cbpiiblghhnlalifiaddecedaeaijdpe?hl=en) has a chromebook app, too.
* [Airdroid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/airdroid/hkgndiocipalkpejnpafdbdlfdjihomd?hl=en-US) is similar to Pushbullet, only the app gives you a bit more functionality than the Pushbullet extension does. I think airdroid also has a larger file size limit than pushbullet when it comes to sending files to mobile. I'm using both for now until I decide which I like better, like everything else, haha.

Edited to add citation tools because tis the season for term papers. Forgot some extensions too and added em in. And I realized I had the web only version of the Evernote app linked and replaced it with one that also works offline. Ad blocker plus. Removes all the extra stuff you don't need to see.  [deleted] I'll check out Momentum and Sidewise. 

I've been using Beeline for a while now. I keep it active on Wikipedia and similar websites. It creates a color gradient on the text and makes walls of text seem more manageable.

I've tried using speed readers like Spritzlet and Squirt but they honestly just make me tired. For us? Cold Turkey. Lets you lock certain websites and apps for a set time so you can remain focused...  [ÂµBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%C2%B5block/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and [Better Pop Up Blocker](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Internet-Applications-Addons/Chrome-Extensions/Better-Pop-Up-Blocker.shtml) in combination stop those distracting pop-ups practically completely, and don't use loads of RAM to run.

Also for any students out there who need to reference journal articles etc. for papers, [ZOTERO](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en) used in combination with the programme on your PC and the Microsoft [Word Plug In](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration) will make your life 100% easier - a little 'cite' button pops up in Chrome when you open a paper and you can save it straight away so you don't forget about it! Momentum looks great thanks. 

So far I only use adblock.

When it comes to bookmarks I create folders depending on which piece of coursework the bookmark is for and then subfolders inside that depending on specific content. 

My Onedrive and my bookmark bar have a very similar hierarchical structure so that any document should have a place where it should go as soon as it is created and any bookmark has a place as well. If it's a really important scientific article though i do just download a pdf to the appropriate place on onedrive
 This is one of 23 mobile chrome tabs I have open. My desktop averages 20-30 tabs on good days, not sure why I didn't think to look for extensions to manage my tab hoarding. 

Remember before most browsers had tabs and everything was in separate windows? Holy shit.  Or you can use Tab Groups in firefox by default.
**Ctrl + Shift + E** or *Customise* your ui to bring it's icon to the main Toolbar. I use OneTab to de-clutter my Chrome window, and Ad Blocker Plus to reduce distractions on websites (with exceptions, like has been mentioned by others).

I also go in spurts where I use the 30/30 app, because it allows for me to work for a certain period of time and then have a guilt-free break (like now!) I am getting better at eliminating distractions so I can actually work during that time, like closing out Facebook. If I am so lucky to be deeply involved in work thanks to a wave of hyperfocus, I can just pause the app and keep working, without taking the break that I don't need right then. When my attention starts to drift, I turn it back on to keep me on task. I've had like 6 tabs open at once before..  [deleted] Shit that Limitless looks fantastic, although I'm almost scared to see how much time I waste on Facebook and Reddit and the likes :S Alright, update on that taco new tab page: I like that it can integrate todoist, trello, evernote, and other to-do lists. I've been using todoist lately and it does show everything, but it doesn't show subtasks as subtasks. And the due dates I assigned them don't show up, either. But it's still good for having a list of tasks in a new tab, so I'm probably gonna keep it for now. I suggest using uBlock. It uses less memory, and doesn't allow for "acceptable" ads. I just wish the widget for android showed more than 3 days at a time. Ditto. Works with Evernote too. Google Keep and Google Calendar are basically my primary brain now, with the stuff inside my skull being just a reddit/9gag processor. Can't live without those. I wouldn't be surprised if I switched over to Google keep for class notes down the line. And even all my to do stuff. Right now I'm using it to keep track of hours to log for work (we submit once a month and I'm always doing it the day it's due... And it's so much easier than a pile of sticky notes) along with other stuff and I'm just afraid of it all getting disorganized because... I suck at organizing, haha. But it is great!  But I like allowing some ads. It doesn't feel right using a free website without donating or allowing them to serve me ads. I know it's not much but allowing a website to serve me ads makes feel like I'm giving back *a little* at least.  I use this too, and [Disconnect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disconnect/jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo?hl=en). Very easy to disable and whitelist sites in both if you're finding they're making it so content you need won't actually load! Acceptable ads? Sunrise syncs with Google Calendar and I'm lame and will use things more if I think the UI is ooh pretty so that's the main reason I switched to it. I kind of wish I could look at it like a week or day view of a planner vs just a monthly view but maybe I just haven't figured out how to do that yet. I love physical agendas when I remember to look at them... But they always get buried in my stuff :/ And all android apps I've found with similar layouts haven't stepped up to chromebook and Windows integration yet, boo. 

Also, I do use mighty text for getting texts on my chromebook, tablet and computer, but that may be more distracting than helpful for people. Haha.  Then turn it off for that website. uBlock can do that too. Ads they get money from their owners, eg from Google, and then see if they are "acceptable". So your adblocker, doesn't block all. Some allow you to turn them off, some don't. uBlock doesn't have that bullshit. I like Google Keep because it's pretty as well, also because it doesn't have much distracting shit. I chose it because I read that book about ADHD tricks (Your life can get better?) and the dude there was very intense on the "red post-it" trick, lol, so I tried something similar using Google Keep and realized that's were my brain had been all the time.

I'm still amazed at my epicly catastrophic short-span memory, and I realized how bad was it on the second day of using Google Keep, lol. Oh, well I might look into that then! Thanks! Oh right. I'll check it out but I haven't noticed anything like that so far. I need to read that book! And ones on GTD technique as well. I am only recently diagnosed and Wunderlist and Evernote were life savers when I was doing college part time, but full time and all upper-level classes for my major (and thus, ALL THE PAPERS) caused me to academically self destruct this last year. I just avoided the papers and didn't do any of them and that doesn't work when they're 50%+ of your grade. My issue is getting started/motivated/not afraid or overwhelmed by large assignments, dividing them into tasks I can handle, and organizing my time. I'm always doing things head on last minute or not at all because I haven't quite figured that out and will waste time online instead to avoid the discomfort. I'm still messing around with which tools help me best with that, but at the end of the day, it's not the tools that make a difference, it's me actually using them. And I'm hoping meds and learning more about this will help :/ No prob man. Meds are a great help, but another good help is to use what you know of ADHD to your advantage.

We are novelty junkies, so keep always looking for schedule management apps to keep yourself interested, and seriously, USE THE HELL OF THAT SHIT as hard as you can as soon as you can, because the trick is to develop the habit before you get bored of the chore. Once you get your stuff sorted and a schedule and task management system that works, adding some notes whenever you need is easy, the boring part is starting to do so because basically we have a ton of crap that we've been dragging behind. These days I got a lot of free time and I'm not even adding a note everyday, but when I started I had like 7 things to do per day.

The book is kinda dense as fuck (I'm one of those people capable of reading TLOTR in 4 days, didn't get to finish this one yet) but the advice and information there is really useful. Stuff about schedule-managing and motivation tricks are worth trying at least, and the dude is funny to read.
