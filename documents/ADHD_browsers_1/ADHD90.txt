I'm finally getting tested this month and I'm so afraid. **TL;DR:**

**-antidepressants fucked me over for years and I'm not going back**

**-lifestyle changes have helped, but I'm still so far from functional**

**-future feels bleak if this isn't it** **the answer**

I was on a bunch of different antidepressants for years and they absolutely sucked the life out of me. The first round made me suicidal, the second did nothing, then the last round left me an emotionless husk. I hadn't realized the fact that I had felt almost **nothing** for months until I missed a dose and everything came rushing back. And of course that's all without even mentioning the slew of side effects.

I've tried lifestyle changes, therapy etc. Even at my "best" - with regular exercise, a decent sleep schedule, healthy eating, meditation, vitamin supplements (d3, magnesium, zinc), socializing regularly, CBT, weekly planner, productivity apps, not watching porn, cutting way back on drug use - my depression and anxiety are improved but I'm still so far from "functional". All of my routines went off the rails this week because my best friend attempted suicide, but I'm getting back on track.

But I still can't think, I can't focus, I can't pursue anything I've ever cared about. I can't start projects anymore because I know I won't finish them. I haven't made any art in what feels like years. I haven't programmed for fun or done any game development since freshman year. I can't listen to a full album, or watch anything longer than 20 minutes. My browser has 100 tabs open (that I'll "look at later") and non of them are remotely related to each other. I'm almost out of college but I'm really struggling. I've been doing really well on homework and tests, but I'm likely going to fail at least 2 of my classes just for attendance. I've was up at 6:00 AM this morning but somehow got to my 9:00 AM class almost 20 minutes late.

This is honestly my last hope. I can't see a future for myself like this if I can barely make it through college and it only gets harder from here. If I get out of this test and I'm either not diagnosed or I get handed off to another psychiatrist who tries to put me on more antidepressants I don't know what I'll have left. I'm so afraid it'll just be more of "nope, you're *actually* just really depressed" and I'll come out of this process no closer to being a functional human being. Don't be scared. This was the best thing to happen \[for my mentality\] in my life. ADHD meds are not a cure all, or a remedy to help with other facets of life. They address an issue, not multiple issues and can exacerbate other pre-existing issues. 

How old are you if I can ask? 21-22? What does your social circle look like? Do you live on your own? 

I understand the anxiety/fear behind not receiving a diagnosis, but you have to be honest with your screening, doctors asking you questions and most of all, yourself. If I can suggest just one change for anyone, its small but difficult....NEVER hit the snooze button and ALWAYS immediately get out of bed to your alarm. Do not second guess it. It sucks, youre tired, cranky, its dark, cold etc....all the excuses. But, this one change has totally revamped my lifestyle and ensures I'm on time. Meds kick in and i get shit done. Good luck! Yeah, 20. Junior at a small college, almost have my CS degree. I do live alone. My social circle is decent. I've got 2 friends online I'm very close to and talk to every day, I've been in a relationship for 5 years (long distance for 3, which is rough but manageable), and have 4 friends on campus who I'm not as close to but hang out with occasionally.


That last thing is something I had been starting to get the hang of before last weekend. Just _doing_ it without even thinking can be huge. Solid. I am a CIS myself, been in IT for 12+ yrs and only returned to meds this past year. It's helped me tremendously as I've taken on a much more demanding role in my career. Fyi, I only take meds M-F.

I also went cold turkey on the antidepressant (AD) route too. I hated how I became so reliant on them to make me feel emotionally 'normal'. I still battle with demons but for the most part, my hobbies (like the gym, sports, friends) keep me in a good frame of mind. The fact that you feel you've exhausted all of your options is not true. So don't let yourself believe that. It's a constant body of work, literally. It's good that you know you don't want the AD meds though.

You sound like a normal, struggling college 'kid' (and i mean that in the most genuine way) nearing the finish line and you're experiencing anxiety over the future. Let's face it, 15 yrs ago I had school debt, wondering where the hell i was going to start my life/career at etc....I had the same worries, all normal. It's worked out, not the way i envisioned, but it has. Great job, good life, good hobby, live in a great city, have a nice but modest home, couple of dogs etc....You'll be fine, just stop putting pressure on the future and things you can't control. Focus on finishing school and start your life.

Hell, my first job out of school was working as a checker at Aldi foods and moving up to management within a year. I had a few other management jobs before I finally landed a role at an IT firm. 10 years later, worked my way up the ladder and I currently hold a Director position. My long winded advice: Be honest with yourself/doctors during your screening and focus on finishing school. Whether or not you receive a diagnosis, don't let that define your actions afterwards unless you change some of your lifestyle changes...like getting out of bed ASAP. Change one thing at a time until it's second nature, them move onto a second....third....etc. Reddit is here to support you! They did for me
