On Adderall for the first time I was prescribed Strattera a few years back by my family doctor. Didn't make it past 3 or 4 weeks before the negative side affects (mostly just a really cloudy mind) and no noticeable benefits led me to shelve it. Now, at age 42, I have gotten a bona fide ADHD diagnosis and was prescribed Adderall at 15mg/twice daily. I'm not going to lie, I was hoping for a silver bullet. I'm 4 days in now and wanted to share my experience and see how it compares to that of others.

The big benefits that I took away from my first few days were a general calmness and reduced distractibility. When driving, my brain seemed quieter (for lack of a better word) and I found myself less prone to grabbing my phone to google random things at stoplights. When sitting at my computer working on some accounting for my business, I realized a few hours in that I had yet to check in on Facebook, and all of the additional browser tabs that I had opened were relevant to the work I was doing. No tangents.

The side effects, though, are giving me some pause. My jaw gets really tense. My doctor warned me that I may have a reduced appetite. Sure enough, the first day I blew right through dinner. I didn't realize that I missed dinner until the next morning when I woke up really hungry. My doctor also warned me that I may have trouble sleeping. That has not been the case. At the end of the day, I have been crashing really hard. Passing out as soon as my head hits the pillow.

So I took the medicine as prescribed Wednesday through Friday. I found myself increasingly irritable in the evenings as it wore off. I've been an emotional mess, sinking to some really low feelings. And I've gotten in multiple fights with my wife (that's not a usual occurrence). I decided to take Saturday off from the meds. I wasn't planning on doing any administrative work, so I thought I could give myself a little break. This whole day has felt like my evening crashes. My head is a foggy mess, and I'm lethargic.

Does it get better? Do people need to acclimate to it? The benefits so far have been really nice, but really subtle compared to the side effects. I'll definitely be talking to my doctor about dosage. The crashing is normally because of a couple things:

- Not eating enough while on the medicine (try protein or meal replacement shakes or lots of snacking if you can't make yourself eat a meal)

- Not getting enough sleep

- Dose is too high or too low One detail that I left out - probably a significant one - is that I consumed alcohol on half of the days. I own and run a brewpub. I don't often drink during the day, other than quality control and vendor samples, but a beer or two with customers or with my dinner is normal. I spoke with my doctor about alcohol interaction. He didn't have much to say other than be aware. It shouldn't have a major effect on the things you're mentioning but just be aware that if you drink while the medicine is still active you will feel it less (so like binge drinking could lead to alcohol poisoning without you feeling as drunk). But then as the medicine wears off, the alcohol will hit you. 

Also, since stimulants and alcohol are both dehydrating, definitely make sure you are drinking enough water/Gatorade (I need Gatorade when I'm taking Adderall for some reason)
