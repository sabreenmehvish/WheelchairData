iPhone app to block other apps? I have an extension to my browsers that prevents me from going to certain websites during certain times and days. Is there anything like that for an iPhone to prevent me from using certain apps during certain times and days? No, because iPhone developers aren't allowed to access the mechanism that would be used to block websites.  I have never found one that works for iOS, but tons that work for android.

As a workaround, I go to restrictions tab, shut off access to any apps including Browsers I'd like to block, and then lock it with a passcode.  Then I keep entering incorrect pass codes 8 times or whatever in a row -- it locks me out of the restrictions setting 5 minutes, then (after entering the code wrong 8-10 more times) 10 minutes, then an hour, then 8 (i think) hours, etc.  It's the only way I've found to impose limits on my browsing. Zero of the app store apps I've downloaded have actually blocked anything (although I haven't checked in a few  months).  The only issue with this method is that there's no way to block specific sites.

I miss my Android for this reason -- blockers galore. 2 recommendations

1. Accessibility option on iPhones called "guided access" allows you to keep an iPhone locked to one app for a certain amount of time or require a passcode to leave

2. An app like "Forest", but there is a similar free app called "Focus Now" which works too. It basically grows a plant over a period of time and leaving the app causes the death of the plant. 

Feel free to pm or reply with questions!  What extension do you use?  Wow, that's an impressive work around.  I guess I will go Android in a few years.  Forest is the best. I want the plant to live and to get more cute plants. I also use it to get off my phone when I need to go to bed but am too restless. Leechblock is a good one.
