Any good reminder programs for both phone AND computer? I'm hoping to find a program that I can put on both my phone and my computer, so that I can add reminders to either, and get a notification on both. Preferably, it should be downloadable as opposed to a browser page, so it's always running. Does anyone have any suggestions? I use outlook, it works pretty well Ticktick works great for me Google Keep is *awesome*. Trello is good too, if you want something more project-based.
