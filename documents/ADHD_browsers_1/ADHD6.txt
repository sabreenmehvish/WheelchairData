How do you guys explain to others what it's like to have AD(H)D? Is usually go for the computer explanation:

&#x200B;

We think faster than others, so our computer is overheated faster. 

We get tired faster and our processor takes longer to reboot.

In stress situations we are perfect and don't make mistakes, 

but if a task is too boring, we will never be able to complete it.

&#x200B; I use a different computer explanation:

A "normal" person has one browser open with multiple tabs open, but none of them make sounds and the info you need/want is easy accessible.

In my brain, I have at least four browsers open and running, with too much tabs open and at least two tabs on each browser makes a noise. Every tab has flashy lights and ads, making it very difficult to find the important info between all the side tabs. None of them can be closed of course. Connecting a jet engine to a dry cleaner. I don't, generally.  The few friends that are close enough to know about my ADHD don't need me to explain it to them.
