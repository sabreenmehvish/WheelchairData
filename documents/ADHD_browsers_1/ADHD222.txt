So you want to do... everything? Using the right tools helps a lot - I use mymaps for organizing adventures 
A link to my western US map:

Before you get too excited with making your own, keep in mind that there is a layer limit. If you're like me and want to do 10,000 things, maybe consider dividing it up a little by region or something. 

For keeping track of raw information about a place (visa regulations, a pretty picture of something, the wikitravel page, etc.), I use a website called planapple.com. They have a browser addon that makes it easy to save and organize links to websites. 

Cheers!
 I do this but with travel books and a million sticky tabs.
