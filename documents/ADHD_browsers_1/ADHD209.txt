ADHD and studying strategies I have just started treatment and felt inspired :p Maybe together we can collate them again. I hope I can make it my pet project to put across study tips in one easy to access place.

---------

**TL;DR**

- Studying is hard. We know. We KNOW.
- Here are some steps. Do one step at a time. Take as long as you need on each step (one year a step is better than no step in forever)
- "Accept" the points before moving on. Seriously.
- Everyone is different. Methods varies and success rate varies. But as long as we don't give up, we'll find something, sometime, somewhere.

----------

**my rant... ignore if can't concentrate enough to read a lot**

[It's hard. (It's efffffffing improbable/impossiburu/I've tried till I almost died.) But without it, what else do we have? What else can we do? Are you just going to give up? 

We are dealt different cards in life. We can give up, or play our hand as best as we can. When we are somebody someday, we can stick the middle finger proudly in the air and say "eff you and your effing ignorance." Or we can just be happy with the fact that we actually can be as productive (if not better) than the 'normal' people. We just have to re-invent our methods instead of following the faulty default way to live.

Remember, it's like everyone else is riding a tame horse, but we are riding a wild bull. Our brains are stronger, we just need to control it.

I'd be somebody someday or I'd die trying. Who wants to join me?]

------------------

**STEP 1:**
- Allow self to be 'different'. 

- Forgive and forget past "non-productiveness".

- Repeat until you're convinced the above is true.

- Don't. ever. give up. 

- Accept failure. (In gaming terms, we still are gaining exp!)

**STEP 2:**
- Accept that we are all different, even amongst ADHD-er. 

- Some of us study better with white noise, some of us in silence. Some concentrate better without stopping for hours (not even toilet breaks), some can only do in short bursts.

- If you can, find out which one you are. You are allowed to be all of them (I am...). Don't fret if you can't find out. If you do, however, start your study intention by surrounding yourself with your concentration boosters (like switching on music in the background whilst you linger around psyching yourself up, setting the books within an arm's reach of your perch, or close curtains and lock the doors and windows etc)

- Never discount any study method (lists, flash cards, mindmaps... ^or ^juicing ^the ^textbook ^and ^drinking ^the ^pulp ^XD ). 
Give it a chance. We are fickle minded and often stop too soon. We need to know that it takes time, effort and repetition to get used to any method and use it effectively.

**STEP 3:**
- Tiny steps. 

- Break everything into digestible points. Put a visual separation between each points (like draw a line...)

- Small step is better than not moving. Reading a paragraph is better than not reading anything. Don't give up moving forward.

**STEP 4:**
- keep things simple

- Use layman terms. You're not any cleverer by using bombastic terms. (an example in the medical world: 'front bit' vs 'anterior') Bombastic terms works our brain harder than it is necessary.

- Get the 'kindergarden' version of your textbook. Digest that first before moving on to the heavy stuff.

**STEP 5**: you're allowed to be messy

- We need to put down our train of thoughts in writing, PRONTO. I don't have to remind you how atrocious our short term memories are... (our long term memory is amazing though!) Handwriting that you can't read again is better than tidy handwritings that misses half the points.

- understand this: we don't write --> our thoughts goes in circle/ too many thoughts a the same time to make sense of things --> we lose track and we forget --> wasted time

- (Uh... actually, I often forgot how atrocious my short term memory is. My brain still want to believe I'm 'normal'... So stop asking why we need to scribble fast, just do it).

- view tidying up messy notes as another chance at reading again and reinforcing your knowledge. but don't waste time making anything neat. We are not like other people.

- (maybe) No electronics! I never found typing helps. Not even handwriting/drawing on ipad. I tried so many times. I ended up wasting time worrying about formatting etc. There's something about the freedom of pen and paper that helps to onsolidate memory. Try. You can always type everything up at the end. Or better, scan your notes so you can't lose it :) I find I remember better when I have a consistent visual input (word documents can easily look and feel different with just a formatting change).


**STEP advanced:**
- search reddit when bored. I just tried 2 minutes ago, I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17ddv9/adhd_studyguide_for_school_enjoy/) hopefully helpful, for example. I'm too tired to read now though...

- if can't read/digest those material, bookmark them, put them somewhere visible and obvious, like on the browser toolbar. Print them and leave them nearby, so at least you can get reminded whenever you see it, and can have a another chance of choosing to read it (instead of forgetting about its existence like we usually do).  Nothing like a physical entity that won't dissapear until you do something about it as a reminder.


**STEP repeat as necessary:**
- don't give up

- believe in yourself. Or 'pretend' a blind faith in yourself until you can genuinely do. We lack insight on our capabilities and almost always underestimate ourselves (not our fault).


**STEP obvious: (please... do it.)**

- Get medicated. Seriously. Even if you don't feel that it's working... (it may be working but you don't feel it or don't know what to expect). If not try others until something fits. Don't rely on yourself to gauge improvement; we have way less insight than we thought we do. Ask feedback on your performance from people close to you who spend a lot of time working with you. Don't let a bad psychiatrist disappoint you; there's always someone else, even on another state.

- Eat well. Try. It's not easy eating properly whilst feeling depressed, anxious etc, not to also add the common side effect of our meds... But if you don't try, what else do you have? What else can you do? It's do or die...

- Exercise. STOP thinking whilst you move your feet to the gym. Thinking makes you convinced there are a thousand better things to do than being bored and sweaty on a treadmill. Do it until you need exercise like you need to breathe.


**STEP I give up... no moar!:**

- come to reddit, vent, get newfound strength. ^(me lurker for years :p)

- try again when ready

- if not ready, just chill, go to the park or something. (avoid anything addictive ^cough... ^games... )

- if jittery, get up and do something, anything. Shout into pillow (no, you're not mental), [break cheap plates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDREuBAnf7M) (It's therapeutic! Put it in zip lock bag so it's easy to clean), exercise your lungs out (boxing? sprinting?)

- don't do anything harmful (eg. can slap self silly but no self cutting or punching walls. Don't stop eating/drinking. Don't lock self in room for more than half a day.) Know that we are usually too stubborn to die, despite maybe feeling suicidal without reason.

- just do something small but significant. Like brushing teeth. Or punching holes in paper used for notes. Walk to throw the trash. Open the curtains. Breathe.

- Then be proud of yourself that you're a well functioning individual. (or still alive despite ADHD challenges)


That's it. For now.

I guess I wrote this mostly to myself too :/ I know what to do, but my brain rebel most of the time. My brain is the conniving sabotager who convince me that playing video games for 24 hours is always a better idea. But I hope there's a sensible part of me who never stop nagging the jello part of me. Just my luck being in a career were I have to study, read pages of boring stuff, and write long pointless papers throughout all my life :(

All the best, ADHD-er in college/school/whatever. You (and I) can do it :)

----------------
**moar rant... just 'cuz**

(if you're still reading, here's a background of what leads me to write this:
I am a doctor. I graduated 4 years ago, and should have been far more advance in my medical training compared to where I am. I am basically doing the same job as the first year graduate, because of lack of confidence, lack of insight and foolishly believing false, damaging feedback from ignorant and unsupportive seniors. 

But the worse thing is my lack of knowledge. I didn't (couldn't) study thoughout med school (Don't ask how I pass finals. I'd believe it if my parents say they bribed the school. I guess I'm pretty good at guessing).

So I'm really interested in developing healthy studying lifestyle. My career and life literally depend on it after all.

Thinking logically (if I am allowed to blow my own trumpet) I must be kinda smart if I manage to pass medical school without reading anything, and manage to look after patients fairly well in 4 years.

But I am at the end of my line here without treatment. My attempt at reading a page of the textbook had been foiled for 10 years now.

I see hope with medication though. *cross my fingers and toes*
Sometimes I WANT to give up. But I can't let ADHD win.

Remember, it's like everyone else is riding a tame horse, but we are riding a wild bull. Our brains are stronger, we just need to control it.

Don't falter, my comrades!) Thank you. Excellent list, Dr.OP! Thanks so much for getting all of that down! Makes me feel like its not a useless battle getting my degree (and this paper done).  Saving this to read later. If I remember. But seriously though. I will read this. I'm a medical student in Brazil and I'm suffering the same as you did. The amount of information I'll have to learn for the next 6 months are INSANE!! 10 hours just of classes daily. I'm on the second week and already way behind what I have to study.

The main issue I face is the constant reminder that I'll fail as a doctor if I keep doing the same. I can't even bring myself to read the whole post. :/ I clicked on this completely by accident while opening tabs on the front page. I'm about half way through an Aerospace Engineering degree with a GPA that makes it look like I've half-assed my way through it. In reality, it's been a struggle bus ride, with my intuitiveness and adrenaline keeping me from flunking out. I needed this more than I need coffee. This was amazing!  Hey, thanks. I needed to read this today. My strategy was to give up and hope for the best:/ it worked....sometimes. Don't thank me yet :) Thank yourself that you're not giving up!

All the best. I know you can. Paper! May you have all the strength to finish it. You CAN, and you will do it well :)

It's never a useless battle. It's a challenging battle, but it's not an un-winable battle.

All the best! I'm like that too >_> 

I've been seeking study tips for years, only to find them, not read them, and keep them aside 'for safe keeping'. Or 'for when I fell like I can concentrate better'.

I lost them all :( I never end up reading. Even the ones I did actually read is forgotten. 

All that I wrote are a distillation of my own findings and frustrations of almost a decade of failing to study, and an attempt for sensible me to remind lazy me that I once thought it's possible...

I'm not suggesting my suggestions are great (I don't know haha), but I suggest printing it (or something that you thing might help but can't read now) and leaving it somewhere visible. 

Then even if you forget and were about to throw it away, you'd remember that you wanted to read it. You'll either read it, or keep it aside to await another reminder. Either way you'll still have a chance to read it, eventually.

I'm really sorry for the length :( I don't know how to summarise it.

But I'll put in my phone a reminder to remind you in 24 hours. Not as a pressure, but in hope that it would improve things. At least the little red envelope can do something ;) You WON'T fail! You can do it :)

The fact that you're in medical school meant that you are decently clever. the reason on why you and I struggle is because medicine is a different beast than highschool, and what reserves carried us through is no longer enough in medicine.

Take courage, take pride. You'll make it through.

Medicine after graduation is more fun because we get to learn through experience rather than swallowing books. You won't fail as a doctor just because you can't read as fast as others.

Book knowledge is just a tiny facet of being a doctor. (I... uh... still am a decent doctor despite not being able to study properly). It takes discernment, good decision making, and reacting well under pressure, to say the least. All of which the books won't teach you, and you can gain by experience.

Belief in yourself.

PS: If you find it helpful I can pass my medical notes as I make them. It helps me held accountable, and hopefully it helps you too. You can do  the same.
Feel free to ask anything that I may try to answer... I'm really really sorry :( I have tried so long to summarise it, and yet it's till long...

All I can say is try print it? 

And then read it slowly when you can, one point at a time? 

Skip the rants.

I know how it feels. I suck at reading...

I read with my finger "guiding my eye" (finger pointing to where I should read and move along slowly). Maybe that helps? I'm really glad you read it and find it helpful :)

The bus ride is very bumpy, but you're not alone. We're all in this together.

Never give up ;) All the best!

PS: woow aerospace engineering! * sparkly eyes * That's so cool :) 
It was my dream (was accepted into it and all, but parents say med school :p). 
Your ADHD will be your strength, eventually. Engineers with the ingenuity of ADHD are super powered ;) No probs :) All the best!

I needed to read it again too, ironically >_>
Funny how my brain doesn't retain what I wrote :p That's my strategy throughout school too! haha...
Adrenaline does amazing thing. Yet another point that proves that ADHD-er are usually pretty smart.

Sadly I'm at the point where doing that can't help me anymore, and I have to study consistently now :(

I've spent too many years being anxious and all depressed about it, I want to change >_> Printing it is a great idea! If it's something tangible, it's much easier for me to remember. Part of the difficulty is that I'm trying to get multiple things done at once right now. I will appreciate that reminder :) thanks! Hello :) this is the non-automated reminder to come back and print ;)

I almost forgot myself too haha...

All the best, man :) Haha thank you! no probs ;) Hope you do remember, if not this is another reminder haha
