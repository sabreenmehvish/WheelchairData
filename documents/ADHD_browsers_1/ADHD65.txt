Is there any checklist app which allows you to link checklists together? [x-post /r/productivity] For instance, say I have a list of things to do:

* Clean house
  * Clean kitchen
      * Do dishes
      * Wipe counter
      * **_Clean floor_**
          * Sweep floor
          * Vacuum floor
          * *Mop floor*
                  * The following three tasks can be put in a separate list (prepare detergent)
                  * Fill bucket with 3 L of water
                  * Add 5 mL of Chemical X
                  * Mix
                  * Use mop
                  * Wring mop
  * Clean room
      * ***Clean floor***
  * Clean bathroom
      * *Mop floor*

Basically, I want to be able to have a list that has an item called clean house, with clean kitchen and clean room and clean bathroom. It's kind of like a collection, or subitems.

* Clean house
    * Clean kitchen
    * Clean room
    * Clean bathroom

Then, I'd like to click on, say, Clean kitchen, and it opens up doing the dishes, wiping the counter, and cleaning the floor.

However, cleaning the floor, for example, is something that happens in many tasks, with multiple subtasks to it (some of which are also used elsewhere), which in turn have multiple subtasks.

I would like to be able to write it once and link it, either by going to the task directly and remembering context, or by expanding it dynamically. That way, if I have to change the procedure, it would change everywhere.

It would also be great if there are checklist overrides, too, though that is not necessary. For instance, if the base checklist for *Mop floor* includes adding 5 mL of Chemical X, but the bathroom requires 7 mL (I don't know much about mopping!), you could either fork it into a reuseable checklist, or simply create an instance that you modify, and can stay linked to the original; (you could unlink it too). That way, if the base changes to need 2.5 L of water, and Chemical Y (less concentrated), then it could change in all instances if you need it to. You would only need to store the diff.

GTD-style tags, contexts, projects, dates, reminders etc are another bonus, but would not be necessary in a strictly checklist situation. (Standard operating procedure maybe?)

Is there anything at all that would allow me to do that (or a subset of it)?

edit: Also, I am not sure where to ask for something like this. Where's the best subreddit? [deleted] Phone dying or I'd say more: check out Workflowy. I swear by it as the ultimate listing tool. No notifications but it does everything else well. Use it in your browser. I really like "Any.do". It allows you to create sub-lists, but not sub-sub-lists. This is such a great idea. If you find anything which works, let me know! Trello would work ok for something like this. I use it for hierarchical projects like that. Otherwise I'll just use Wunderlist. I like Google Keep. I keep it on all my devices which is super helpful. There isn't a way to do so that will give notifications (at least not one native to Reddit; may be browser addons), but underneath the original post is a SAVE button. If you click that, then later on you can click your name in the very top right corner, then go to the 'saved' tab, and there you can see saved posts.

I'll also plug [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/), a browser addon that adds a lot of handy features and customization to your everyday Reddit browsing experience. [[Features page]](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/features.html) Almost all that I have seen, including Wunderlist and Todoist etc, allow sublists, but not list linking. (Specifically, I'd like to pass a list by reference instead of by value.) Thanks :) People have suggested Workflowy and dynalist.io. Workflowy has a limit of 250 items a month, which is way too little for me, so I am using [dynalist.io](https://dynalist.io/) for now. They were already working on adding note linking, and I added a couple of feature requests (nesting, diffs, regex).

They were started in June, but looking at their progress, I think they might implement these soon.
