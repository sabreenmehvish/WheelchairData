Scrivener has made essay writing so much easier! (Mac/Windows/iOS) I thought I'd let you all know about some software that has helped me a lot with my studies, particularly essay writing. It's called Scrivener, developed by Literature and Latte. 

Previously I was using MS Word and I would have about 3 different word documents open along with numerous internet browser tabs full of stuff that was relevant for different parts of the assignment. I downloaded Scrivener on a 30 trial and it has made essay writing so much easier and faster. Once I've sorted out my xmas expenses, I'm going to buy it.

It was designed for writers but its also great for students. It allows me to keep numerous folders and notes categorized into different sections within a single document, so I can keep my reference list in one section, my research notes in another section (subdivided by topic), and my essay draft in another section (also divided by topic). It allows me to add to different areas in the order that I think of things without making a mess of the document, then I can merge it all together at the end. 

For fellow students who struggle with organising essays, I  recommend downloading the trial to see what you think. It's 30 days of actual use, not 30 consecutive days. So if you don't use it for a week, you don't forfeit those days of use. Great for me since I have a tendency to forget about things like that and not actually get enough use out of trial periods XD

Someone has written a decent outline of it's functions here: http://writetodone.com/write-faster-scrivener/

TL;DR: There's writing software called Scrivener that has helped me heaps because I can divide my work into topics. It's like having tabs within a single document.
