[method] How to beat crippling procrastination in 5 steps without beating yourself up ##### Broken attention span? Feel crippled by procrastination? Can’t get work done? I wrote up the method I use to get back on track in 5 steps.

&nbsp;

I’ve always been a procrastinator. I was a smart kid, and managed to get away with it for most of my life. Finally, in adulthood years of bad habits are starting to catch up and have a negative impact on my life. I want to share my method for just getting started - when you’ve gotten to the point that any sort of difficult work becomes something you dread. 

I cross posted in r/ADHD, r/getdisciplined and r/nonzeroday. Hopefully someone finds my methods helpful.

&nbsp;

### Step 1 - Gather Tools

1. Find or install an auto-advancing timer. I like [Time Doser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timedoser/cmkneeaihlcdllananjlkmppnkdahdcc?hl=en) for Chrome or the [Marinara Timer](http://www.marinaratimer.com/)
2. A browser plugin that can selectively block websites. I use [StayFocused](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) for Chrome. Turn the extension on, add any distracting websites (youtube, twitter, reddit) to the rules.
3. 2 blank sheets of paper, 1 pen or pencil
4. A glass of water. It’s important to stay hydrated while you work. Avoid sodas and sugary drinks that will perk you up and make you come crashing back down.

&nbsp;

### Step 2 - Clear your Workspace

1. Close all tabs. The [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en) chrome extension simplifies this process.
2. Turn off your phone, put it in another room.
3. If you know you won't need your computer for research, shut it down. 
4. Clear your desk or workspace of any unnecessary items, besides for reference materials you need for your task.

&nbsp;

### Step 3 - Prepare Yourself

1. Choose a task you’d like to accomplish. It’s important that this task is concrete - a bug to work on, a test to study for, homework that's due — whatever applies to you.
2. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Step away from the computer and find a place to sit quietly. You want to think about the task at hand, and prepare to work on it. During this time, don’t do busy work, fold laundry, listen to music, or check your phone. No multi-tasking! Try not to do anything besides for thinking about the task at hand and how you will approach it. Note what emotions come up when you think about the task, or getting started. Do you feel fearful of getting a bad grade? Do you fear being embarrassed because your work isn't good enough? Maybe the idea that your current procrastination up to this point will be found out gives you massive anxiety. Acknowledge that procrastinating further won’t solve your problems, the only path to feeling relief is to do the work. Acknowledge these feelings, but don’t beat yourself up. You may have messed up in the past, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do better in the future. Acknowledge that procrastination doesn’t make you a bad person. It took years to develop the habit, so don’t expect changes overnight. Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t follow a program exactly. Some progress is always better than none. 
3. Once this timer is over, grab the first sheet of paper. Take 10 undistracted minutes to break down the task into checklist with tiny steps. No task should take more than 5-15 minutes to complete and be as specific as possible. i.e. not “read chapter 1” but “read 5 pages of chapter 1”.  Add a quick time estimate (how long you think it’ll take) to each task. 

&nbsp;

### Step 4 - Get Started

1. Take a deep breath
2. Set up auto advancing (10+2)*5 timer. There's a link to this method at the end. Don't read it until you've done your work. The gist: set up a timer with 10 minutes of work, 2 minutes of break, for 5 times in a row.  You can do anything for 10 minutes! Repeating it 5 times adds up to an hour.
3. If you need to be on the web to do your work open one blank tab. Then, start nuclear mode on the Stay Focused browser extension for 1 hour. This will block any distracting websites. 
4. If a random idea pops into head (i.e I forgot to buy milk when I went to the grocery store) write it down on the 2nd sheet of paper, and ignore it until later. Your brain is your enemy, and will use dirty tricks like this to try to distract you from difficult tasks that involve brainpower. Don’t fall for the trick.
5. Work on the first task on the list, and cross it off when it’s done. Celebrate when checked. The checklist should leave no time to think about what the next task is. Use the same autopilot that causes you to lose focus in the first place.
6. If you need to work on a task that’s not on your list, take a moment to add it. 
7. When break time comes - add a mark to the task on your list to indicate it took 10 minutes of time. Adding up the marks will let you know how long you took to finish the task once it’s done. Take a moment to celebrate and congratulate yourself for 10 minutes of productive work. Listen to a song, stretch, get a drink of water, use the bathroom. I personally prefer to color in an adult coloring book - it's relaxing. It’s important not to skip breaks.
8. Start working again as soon as the break timer is up. As soon as the break timer is over, drop what you were doing, and get back to work. After all, it’ll be just another 10 minutes before you can get back to your fun break activity.  

&nbsp;

### Step 5 - Follow up

Once the task is complete, go back and compare the amount of time you thought the task would take vs the amount of time it actually took you. Did you think something would be done quick, but it turned into a huge time suck? Were you dreading a task that you finished in just one 10 minute spurt? Note the discrepancies, and keep them in mind when estimating how long a task will take during your next task building session. 

&nbsp;

Once 5 of these sprints are over, you’ll have accomplished a full hour of productive work. Feel free to pat yourself on the back and celebrate your success. Go for a walk around the block or eat a small healthy sweet treat like a piece of fruit or tea with honey. Take a longer 15 or 20 minute break, then start over. Remember to set a timer for your longer break, and get back to work immediately when it goes off. After a few weeks of 10 minutes of working followed by a 2 minute break, you can try increasing your work periods to 15 or 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break (similar to the Pomodoro method). Most importantly-- don’t beat yourself up for falling off the horse. Feeling bad about yourself or causing yourself anxiety will make you fall back into the procrastination pit faster. If you find yourself falling back into old bad habits, stop, and get stated again with Step 1. The more you stick with the plan, the easier it’ll be to get work done every day.

&nbsp;

**Optional:** Check in with yourself at the end of the day in a judgement free way. Did your accomplish your goals? Were you happy with the way you spent you time? If you didn't, don't beat yourself up about it. Just note the results, and think about ways you can do better next time. Once you've been on track for a month, you can set up goals for how many work sessions you'd like to accomplish in a day. Make sure you start with a low number (1-3), to you set yourself up for success. If you beat your target amount of sessions, great! But, don't keep moving the bar up until you're ready. After a month, you can also set up a weekly check-in with yourself to keep track of longer term goals and projects.

[Here](http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/11/procrastination-hack-1025) is Marlin Mann's blog post about beating procrastination with the 10+2**5 method. It's the foundation of my tips, since when I first got started I had trouble focusing for a whole 25 minute [Pomodoro](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730).  Wow, thanks! I'll read this later... I have the feeling I'm going to have serious trouble with that 15 mins of thinking about the task. For all the time I spend in my head, a shockingly small amount of it is productive instrospection...too upsetting, maybe. Curious, I’m a little different here and wondering if you, u/--ninja , have the same problem. If I actually get into a paper then I kind of fear stopping until I finish it or else I know I’ll struggle to be able to start writing it/finish it after I’ve stopped. Ever happen to you? 

You’re plan would be interesting to try out for the rest of the time when I take days to try and start something. It doesn't have to be perfect the first time. Maybe start with 5 minutes for a week, and gradually increase the time you spend thinking about the specific task you need to get done next. I realized I'd be setting myself up for failure by expecting perfection the first time I tried anything.
