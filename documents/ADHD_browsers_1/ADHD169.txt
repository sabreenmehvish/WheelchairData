Organization tools in general and planning apps on android? Are there any programs that work well for to do lists, planning etc?  
I've got a sticky note app but it sits in the background and becomes ignored once I open browsers and other progs.  Emailing a to do list quickly gets lost as the new emails pour in.  I am thinking an old school whiteboard might be the best thing.  Perhaps something that is on the fridge.  

I find I can't get into using my smartphone for taking notes or using the planner.  Anyone find a planner app that feels intuitive? I use a combination of things:

- Todoist (primary - almost everything goes in here, bucketed into projects, and I always have it open in a browser window on my laptop. It's on my Android phone. I have the Slackbot installed, Chrome and Outlook extensions installed. It's everywhere. Reminders throughout the day.)

- Google Calendar (for longer appointments rather than tasks.)

- PomoDone app (on Android and Windows desktop. Available for other platforms too. I sync my "Work" project from Todoist and work through them using the promodoro method.)

- Work journal (physical lined pages. Every evening I write down times at half hour intervals in the margin, consult todoist and google calendar, and plan out tomorrow.)

- Personal journal (physical, ruled pages, write down random crap that pops into my head. Seldom reviewed. Mostly just to "get it out.")

- Smart watch (buzzes to let me know when to do things. Other than Todoist, Calendar, and calls, ALL other notifications are turned OFF. Saves me getting out my phone and getting distracted by facebook).

- Whiteboard (Physical. On my desk somewhere it can't be missed. Every morning I come in, write down the priorities for the day).
 Do you just use the basic version of Todoist?

 Echo the notion that a combo is necessary. 

I prefer Workflowy for primary todolist for ease of expanding/collapsing and moving items around.

I keep notes in Google Docs, which I link to items in Workflowy to keep from cluttering my todo list with notes.

/u/og-ninja-pirate - what do you mean by a "planner"? i.e. What function(s) are you looking for? I'm using the premium version. I believe most features I use are available on the basic version. Reminders might be missing, I can't remember.

But for $30/year or whatever it is, I used it every day, it was worth it for me. Hadn't heard of Workflowy before.  Their website just has a bunch of testimonials and no details about the app itself.  Will give it a try though.  

In terms of planner, I meant something different to the google S-planner.  I guess the main thing is keeping me focused on my goals.  Studying for exams while working full time.
