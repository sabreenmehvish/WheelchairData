Time Management & Organization Skills for ADHD Students Okay guys! I’ve seen endless amounts of posts on here about people looking for help to get motivated and organized for studying and school. With that said, I’ve been absentmindedly making a list in my head of things I do that help me stay on task, stay motivated and minimize procrastination as much as I can. I really hope this list helps, as it’s taken me a couple years to fully integrate all of this into my life, but it has helped so much.

**Time Management/Procrastination**

-	*Forest App*: This app is AMAZING and it’s available for your smartphone as well as an extension for Google Chrome (I use both). You set an amount of time that you need to dedicate to something (studying, homework, cleaning, etc.) and the app plants a seed, and locks you out of your phone/web browser. At the end of the time, you have a tree! If you can’t seem to resist the temptation, your tree will wither and die. Yes, you’re still able to access the Internet, BUT you don’t get the gratification of building up your forest if you do that.
-	*Over utilizing Calendar apps*: It comes off as obsessive planning, but let’s be honest. ADHDers kind of need some of that in their lives. Since I’m attending university, at the beginning of the semester I can download my class schedule to my calendar on my Mac, which I sync with my phone. From there, I **overestimate** the time it takes for me to walk to and from class, figure out when I have good blocks of time to study, and add in 5-10 minutes breaks to get a snack, or just let my mind wander and relax for a bit. If need be, you can even add which subject you specifically want to study at a given time to help keep you on task and not get overwhelmed by your work.
-	*White boards & daily planners*: In addition to my calendar apps, I write down important due dates, test/quiz dates, reading assignments and my work schedule in my daily planner and on a white board that hangs next to my desk that I update every week. If I’ve spaced out while I’m doing homework, or in between assignments, my to-do list for the week is right in front of me so I don’t have to remember the odd spot I placed my daily planner, or try to remember what I was going to work on next.
-	*Overestimate time & get it done early*: If you’re like me, you’re perpetually late and wait until the last minute. It took some mental training and failures at first, but overestimate the amount of time something is going to take and tell yourself it needs to be done **the day before**. Need to read a 20-page chapter for English by Thursday? Tell yourself it’s going to take you an hour and a half and that it needs to be done by Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. This gives you some wiggle room for distractions, and if something comes up, or you do end up procrastinating a bit, you still have time to get it done.


**Motivation**

-	*Set goals*: I’m sure this topic has been beat to death for some of you (myself included), but that’s because we need a little more than just “My goal is to graduate HS/College”. Start out with some baby goals: My goal is to study regularly for Calculus so I can do well on my first test. With a good grade on my first test in Calculus, my goal is to get a B in the class. With a B in Calculus, my goal is to get a 3.0 for the semester. If you can commit these to memory, awesome! If not, **write them down**. In the notes app on your phone, word document on your computer, another white board for your room/study area (no judgment, I have three white boards in my room), sticky notes on your mirror in your bathroom, it really doesn’t matter. Just make sure you’re aware of your goals big & small.
-	*Get yourself a buddy to hold you accountable*: This probably seems silly to some, but I know we’ve all been in the situation of wanting/needing to do something and just not being able to motivate yourself to do it. When this happens, reach out to someone, whether through text or posting on the subreddit. It can be as simple as “I need to study chemical bonds for my Chemistry quiz tomorrow. **Tell me to just do it**.” I have a few friends that I text when I’m in this mindset, and they help provide me with the motivation to get it done, because I know they’re going to ask me about it later, and I’m not going to feel great if I still haven’t done it.


**Self-care**

-	*Schedule downtime*: I tend to hyperfocus on schoolwork when I’m in the right mindset, and I’m ready to work all night. But if you’ve been at it all day, or even part of the day, give yourself a break. Get a snack, watch a YouTube video (I recommend How to ADHD :P), watch a 20-30 minute episode of something on Netflix, whatever! Just relax for a bit and then make sure you get back on task afterwards. I’ve used an app for my mac called Self Control that lets you take a break for a specified amount of time, and then will not let you access distracting websites outside of that break time. It may also be available for your smartphone!
-	*Additional scheduling*: In my calendar app on my phone and computer, I also have time for sleep scheduled, downtime before bed to read, watch TV or whatever, and time to process, organize notes and adjust my schedule if need be. Self-care is extremely important, especially when focusing, staying organized and staying on task is so taxing on our minds. Even if you’ve implemented all of these strategies and feel like you can do it all, you still need to take some time for yourself to decompress and relax so you don’t burn out.


I hope this list can help you guys, even if you’re only utilizing one strategy from this list. It took me a while to really get myself organized in this way, and I still struggle with organization (you do NOT want to see my desk or closet right now).   I'm with you on the over-organizing. My calendar is a burst of very specific and helpful colours, and everything that's not specifically slotted in is automatically assumed to be downtime that I can use for my leisure or - if I've got a productive mood going - use to tackle my running to-do list.

Tracking what I have to get done also helps me capitalize on all my many moments of serendipity. "I have to get lunch. Later tonight, I should swing by the bank and then the drugstore. Holy crap, there's my bank and a drugstore attached to this food court I'm heading to for lunch!" This is a really useful post. I have ADHD, but I also teach and work with students on learning and study skills, and because of my background students with ADHD are often referred to me. If I credit you and share the final product (that you can use as you wish), would you be o.k. if I turned this advice into a handout?  They 'believe' me, but it's always good to get the advice from someone who is living the experience. Something that I've been using for goal setting is setting maximum time allotted to something. For instance, I'll write "spend **at most** one hour on math." I used to write down "spend **at least** 30mins on math". The reason why this has helped me a bit is because I know that even if I spend literally one minute on the task, I've still technically completed my goal. So it helps with the initial hurdle of starting.  This is really helpful, thank you :) Thank you for this. As a parent of an ADD teenager, I've come to identify ADD in myself as well. While I've developed coping skills over the years, my son is struggling and I'm struggling to help him. You've offered some great new ideas that I know will help both of us. That’s a perfect response. Love it! What a gift. I work with University students. I do something similar for myself — carry around a notebook for the just that thing.  And encourage my boys to as well.  I do the same thing! I’ve somehow managed to free up my weekends to get additional work done at my leisure, run errands or relax. I’m so glad I was able to get myself organized for the first time in my life!  I’m not sure what age group you’re working with and I am NOT an expert on teaching or on ADHD, but I recently pulled my 7 year old daughter from private school due to many reasons I won’t go into. I was terrified to take that leap from Mom to teacher mode, but so far it has been going amazingly well. 

Anyway, I’m in the beginning stage of homeschooling her and sometimes I have to pull things out of my butt in the moment and use my imagination. This specific example is actually working really well. 

My daughter often gets distracted by random thoughts or questions that pull her attention away from the task at hand. It’s absolutely impulsive and I found that stifling it caused her anxiety; if I do that, she says that the thought then sticks in her head and distracts and distracts her that she’s then unable to remember what she’s supposed to be doing  as she’s caught up in the loop of, “stop thinking about this.. “ over and over.

So I created a notebook called Curiosity that I carry with me. When the thought or question comes, she voices it out loud to me and I note it in her notebook. For example, during math the other day, she blurted, “how do you forge iron?” I personally couldn’t see the correlation and to me, it appeared irrelevant, but I’ve learned to trust that there is likely an intricate and complex path she took that makes her question relevant if only I could get in there to see it. 

ANYWAY, after all her necessary projects and lessons are finished, I take an extra hour at the end of the day to either discuss her thoughts or answer her questions, research it together, watch a video or if something is really interesting, we’ll go to the library to find a book about it and add it to the curriculum. 

I’m hoping in time it will teach her that yes, ADHD can sometimes cause you to climb a tree to explore its branches which then leads to the discovery of its twigs, its buds, its height, etc., and that’s okay. But sometimes we need to stay rooted to the main idea before we can explore further, otherwise we’ll be swinging from tree to tree having no real foundation of understanding the core subject. But there IS an appropriate time to do this and we can always climb it later when the time is right. 

I’ve held firm on this the past two weeks and it’s working very well for us. She feels she is being heard and feels she has more control over that impulse. She trusts that we will scratch that itch later, so to speak, and so when she voices it to me, she can let it go quickly and go back to what she’s working on.  

It has also been surprisingly helpful in another way I didn’t expect. It has helped her to choose her questions more wisely. Even if I personally thought her question was a bit silly, I still wrote it down and discussed it with her. She was actually embarrassed by some of her questions and was uncomfortable with me taking the time to answer them.  I always tell her that no question is stupid if there is genuine curiosity and a desire to learn. But still, it’s an important skill to learn and she is doing exactly that in a natural way by asking herself if it’s important, relevant, attention seeking, etc., before voicing it.

It’s been a great bonding experience and a wonderful way for me to get a glimpse of her amazing brain. I know this may be impossible to do in a classroom with lots of students, but it may be useful for child and their parents do at home for homework, etc.

 Yeah, absolutely! I know it’s difficult and I just want to help people where I can. :) I really hope it does help. I wasn’t diagnosed until 27, and I’m finally finishing college now. I struggled a lot in high school and when I initially tried going to college. The diagnosis, medication and this system has helped more than I can even say. Where I was once failing just about everything,
I’m now able to maintain a 3.6.  This sounds like an amazing method! I used to have a lot of issues with random thoughts and just needing to know (I’ve fallen down quite a few Wikipedia rabbit holes as a result). I’m going to start utilizing this strategy when I have those random thoughts now. Thanks for sharing! :) Thank you!  I will send it to you when I'm done and get more details so I can credit you at that point. :) I can’t believe I signed my post. Such a mom thing to do.
