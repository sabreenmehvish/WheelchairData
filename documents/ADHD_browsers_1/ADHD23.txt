How I'm curbing my smartphone addiction.....I'm secretly in love with this thing! [Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere 2](https://imgur.com/a/UsbB9)

I'm an IT generalist and need my phone for work. However, I don't need any non\-productivity apps, a stellar camera, or a huge screen. This thing does email, phone/texting, GPS, legible pictures, and a few other odds and  ends. It was all of $20 on Ebay!!!

WTF did I spend hours of research on a phone that costs 35x's more? If I could turn back time I would have so much more money and less buyers remorse.

I think Meds help ADHD tremendously, but so does life changes. IMO Staring into a smartphone all day for instant gratification does not good things for our already sub\-par attention spans and ease of distraction. 

I've only had it for 2 days and I already feel like a pioneering badass with more reason to take the time to talk to people and look at what's around me. While not as economical as your stratosphere, I feel the same way about my apple watch. All the things I need but without the distractions, plus an added bonus that I always know where it is! does it have a browser? I have been looking for years for a phone that supports email but doesn't have an internet browser. I have to have email on my phone for work otherwise I'd get a dumb phone, but it seems like any phone that has email comes along with the oh so tempting, soul sucking browser. It does. It's a legit smartphone, just old, slow and cheap!
