browser extensions for focus What browser add-ons does /r/ADHD use to stay focused on the web? I recently switched to Chrome (or rather Chromium, 'cuz I like [free software](http://www.reddit.com/r/freesoftware "shameless plug for /r/freesoftware — Go GNU/Linux! :D")), and I have been looking around for stuff today. So far I have: 

* *[Omnibox Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnibox-timer/iooaeaogjngpihndkcednkblomlkaaif) for setting timers for myself.*

There were lots of others but they were all slow and annoying to use. No point getting a timer add-on I find even slightly annoying. I won't always use it when I'm stressed, and that's when I'll need it most! Currently looking at [Cool Clock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cool-clock/icegcmhgphfkgglbljbkdegiaaihifce) as an alternative. It seems really nice, but still not fast enough for quick timers.

* *[Web Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-timer/ggnjbdfgigejghknieofeahaknkjafim) for reviewing how much time I spend where.*

Its button marks the number of minutes you've spent on the active tab's website that day, which makes for a nice passive reminder.

* *[Control Freak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/control-freak/jgnchehlaggacipokckdlbdemfeohdhc/) for context-sensitive reminders.*

Control Freak claims to be like Greasemonkey, but optimized for quick tweaks. I only just got it, so idk how it'll go yet, but I'm trying to implement custom alerts, popups, and sticky notes with it. It lets you do a lot with HTML, CSS, and JS –even import libraries for scripts–, so I have high hopes.

* *[Controlled multi-tab browsing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/controlled-multi-tab-brow/kokmfemecmlekdnjllgobeplngdfifie) keeps me down to 8 ^((customizable)^) tabs per window.*

Doesn't stop me from opening a lot of junk and getting confused, but it keeps tab titles legible and makes me think about it a little more about opening too many things. Still not great though. Some sites generate new tabs as notifications for stuff and they're closed again immediately if I'm at the limit. But idw a full tab manager, I just wanna keep tabs lean. How do you manage tabs?

**TL;DR To stay focused online I got time trackers, egg timers, tab limiters, and now I'm trying to put sticky notes on _the net itself_. I don't like my current tab limiter though. What do you do?** Stay focus'd for chrome.  ~LeechBlock (Firefox)

Leechblock can block websites and set timers for websites. It is easy to set up, allows for day to day blocks so you can have more free time on the weekends or certain days of the week.
It is easy to just use another browser, as I do time to time, but It has drastically reduced my time on the internet.


~Sticky Notes (Win 7, Possibly older and new versions)

I study Japanese at uni, whenever I see Kanji or words I don't know, I would impulsively need to know their meaning right away. Using Sticky notes I can add them to a note, then look up their meaning at the end of the day/week so I don't wreck my train of thought. This is great for general impulsivity since you can leave idea's, URLs or whatever is on your mind and then come back to them at a later time. 
The application is also great from basic daily/weekly planning since its always in your taskbar or on your desktop. Here's a list of that help me stay focused online:

* READABILITY for destroying distractions on long articles. 

* POCKET for saving long anxiety inducing articles for later (also compatible with Readability).

* ADBLOCK for disabling distracting advertisements.

* CLEA.NR for YouTube to streamline and eliminate distractions.
