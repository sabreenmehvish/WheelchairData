Browser Tab-aholics check in here: how many tabs have you held open that you're going to go back & read - For over a week? A Month? A Year? Now technology is an enabler - smartphones that never have to shut down, OS's that restore everything after a crash. We don't even get a clean slate forced on us anymore by a reboot.  
  



Edit: Holy sheise-on-marble-rye, you people are magnificent beyond my wildest expectations. 
  

  
edit 2: Mods - How about a weekly post? - "Tab Tuesday??" - Read / Resolve / Close 2 Browser tabs. :) If you use chrome, I highly recommend [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en) and [One Tab](https://www.one-tab.com/). The first one works passively and suspends tabs that you haven't clicked on in a while, so they're not using up memory and killing your battery. Then, when you click on the tab it starts again. The second one is a button that you push that closes your excess tabs but it saves them in list so you can go back to them if you want.  I found out a while back that chrome on android stops showing you how many tabs you have open after you pass 99. It just shows you a toothy smile emoji, :D. I'm not sure how many hundreds I have open now, and there's no way I'm going to count them, but I would guess it's several times that amount. I add things to my bookmarks as if I'm ever going to open them... Sometimes I have to binge close tabs just because someone (me) has to be the adult in the room and own up to the fact that I'm never going to read all of them. 

Facebook I have 67 unread articles I've saved
browser tabs- 23
phone- 49
bookmarks----- infinite...
  I routinely reach "infinity" (100+) on my phone before my browser crashes. Whenever I cut it down to something reasonable (below 30 tabs, say) it doesn't last more than a day.  I counted just for you, I have 43 on my laptop currently.  I am very good at keeping tabs closed *pats self on back* Is this what's killing mg phone battery? I usually have 70+tabs open. I didn't even know I could do it until the first time it happened. Just counted 64 tabs across two separate chrome instances (one on each monitor for... uh... efficiency?) Even though I know it's ridiculous and I should just close out all my tabs from days ago, when I go back to close them my brain suddenly remembers why they were so important and just like that I fall back down the rabbit hole.

Typical me:

"Alright! Today's a good day! I'm finally being productive and getting shit done... Wait a minute... what's this tab?.... "Different Grades of Leather and How Best to Use Them"?... OHHH!!! How could I forget about all of the hours I spent on Wednesday researching how to become a master leather worker/cobbler?!" 

I'll then proceed to watch leather working tutorials on YouTube for an additional 3 hours... knowing full well I'll probably never actually do any kind of leather working in my life.

Oh, it's a new day? Swap out leather working with a new obsession (i.e. Bitcoin mining, Bow-fishing, gardening, home security camera systems, obscure dog breeds and their origins, various business ideas, etc.)

Rinse and Repeat :) I cant even count how many even while medicated, id lose track of counting out loud or in my head or get distracted by something else or go absent minded and need help to be cued where I left off 700 tabs, more than 150 on phone probably Looks like there are lots of great apps and extensions to handle any "Tab-gate" we create for ourselves.

The common theme however, seems to be that they barely even get revisited...  
So to me, the real issue is the inflated sense of importance our brains are attaching to these articles, recipes, leads, links whatever.  

These things get squirreled away like golden nuts and yet when it comes time to look into them my brain is totally not interested.
It seems like the exact same mechanism as hoarding and OCD - **does anyone know of relevant articles or medical studies?**

I promise not to keep the tabs open :) Soon to go and get diagnosed... I always thought I was just a hoarder? I have over 600 tabs in my browser right now (so detrimental as it causes so much lag and corrupt Firefox profiles), dates back a few years ago. I go back every year or bi-anually (because no time... have too much to do which, because of ADHD, takes up too much time) to try to 'clean up' these tabs, I delete the really unnecessary ones but this is what it's come to. Over the last 12 years on the internet, I have over 49802 bookmarks - I barely refer to them unless I need to - but I feel as though I need to have it. I would get so frustrated and sad when one day I lost all my tabs because I accidentally closed Firefox without saving or the profile got corrupt and the 'restore previous session' didn't function anymore (it lost all the tabs). I keep trying to save every frigging thing I find thinking its useful and ill come back to it later and dont want my attention alloted to this saving of bookmarks only to never retrieve and use it again. I try hoarding bookmarks and webpges and articles on evernote. i used to use onenote. Now I just use bookmarks because evernote isnt free and im excessive with my usage. I then dwell on finding the best notes software and never stick to a domain, hence the movementnfrom usig bookmarks to onenote to evernote.  On my phone I go up until I've reached 50/60 tabs, then I copy all the links into a word document (which I will look at from time to time or sort by topics just for the fun of it), then I will close all the tabs.
Hardly ever bookmark anything on my computer. If I don't read it right away, then I close it.
Can't do that on my phone though, because I sometimes collect ideas+links like a crazy bird. Me me me. I actually made a promise to myself last night and closed all but the tabs I still wanted to read but hadn't yet. After a week or so, all the digital clutter of dozens and dozens of tabs and windows drives me nuts, so I copy paste into a Google doc all the links I'm unable to prune and still want to look at later. A doc which I'll forget about and never look at again. So I keep making new ones... But, I feel better and can continue on, so it works.

Pinterest is better for keeping track of the really good links, when I remember. Sometimes the add-on to pin stuff breaks, so great stuff sometimes ends up lost in the Google doc bin too.    Get Vivaldi and use tab stacks.  I'm looking at 7 article tabs at work (21 total tabs), and I always manage to have the maximum amount of tabs allowable on my iPhone (must be 15-20+). Home computer has 30+. Life is chaos. One Tab is an extension which will save your tabs as a bookmark and then have all these tabs in one place.  Aka save it to read later. Guys, use Pocket to save the articles for reading later! Out of sight, out of mind. :) Well last night my computer started protesting the chrome abuse, so I had to restart it. Now I'm down to like 15 or so. But reading htis made me remember one of last night's casualty was "tie dye sneakers" so off I go! Do pinned tabs of guides for every video game I've played in the past year (and some the bf was playing) count? I've bookmarked so many things that fall into such a broad spectrum. It's provides great insight into how quickly my interests have changed over a couple of years from cooking recipes to workout routines to how to build PCs to how to stop from procrastinating. I'll find these articles thinking they're a good read and that I don't have time to read them so I bookmark them. When I go back to them, I find that I lost interest in actually reading them but I don't delete them because maybe I'll find interest in them once again. I have way too many bookmarks. Love "the Great Suspender" only way my underpowered ChromeBook stays functional with all those tabs open!

I'll give One Tab a try. Thanks! I find the one suspender to annoy the hell out of me, I keep having to wait for things to reload. I shouldve gotten a 16gb ram computer instead of a 4gb one I use both, but One Tab is just a huge list of things I should check out… some day…   Irony: I now have a tab opened to One Tab, waiting on me to get back to it later. :D You need one tab!  Just missed it, I had a bad few days and reached 98 before I decided to have a clean up because phone was crashing alot.

About 10 tabs have survived though from around November 2016 :) This is me!!! Every week or so i get fed up with the 5-6 day old tabs and just up and close them all, regardless of why i opened them. Can lead to some trouble if the old tabs were important... Yeah, this thing on Facebook where you can save a video/post/whatever to watch/read later is killing me. I have about 100 unopened saves in there that I will probably never get round to, yet I still keep saving more stuff, ughhh. [deleted] >  I copy all the links into a word document

manually? No, that's excluded by

 **Part 7,  Section 5a:**  
*The use of tabs as guides, tips, or walk-throughs for video gaming shall not count towards the total allocation, provided they are-  
A) For the sole use of the owner of the device, partners, or dependants only.  
B) Open for a period not exceeding 12 months.  
C) Pinned*
 I thought at first you were saying I didn't need all those hundreds of tabs, and that one tab would do it. Didn't realize it was an app until I looked at the other comments. One Tab looks like exactly what I need. Thanks! I've been to that place of self control a few times, and damn it feels good.  
I'm just not ready for all that commitment yet :) No, via google drive! Manually would make me go insane :) *thinks comment is controlling, finds out u/writeandknow is actually an enabler!!  Sorry, lol! I forgot to put it there! i didn't know you could do that. how? shhh I just use an addition for chrome, which you can download [over here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-all-urls/djdmadneanknadilpjiknlnanaolmbfk?hl=en)
