To those of you who have suddenly started getting more acne on your back & body, and don't know why... When was the last time you washed your bath towel (or changed your bed sheets)? I'm willing to bet good money that most of us forget to change out our towels on a regular basis (especially us guys). That shit could be growing mold... and then you wipe it all over your body & face??? 

>***Why is proper washing important?***

>Towels get moist when you dry off with them. The porous, damp environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. A common bath towel can have yeast, mold and E. coli. growing on it, without you ever knowing it. Gross, right? Regular washing prevents bacteria from growing.

>***Reuse or wash?***

>There are some variables when it comes to how often you should wash your towels. Consumer Reports says that under normal circumstances, a towel can be used three or four times before it needs to be tossed in the hamper. Now notice, I said "times" not "days." So if you have multiple family members using a towel, then on the third or fourth use it needs to be washed. This goes for hand towels, too.

>Also, the condition of the person using the towel matters, too. If they're sick, toss it in the laundry after one use. If it's flu season, it's best that every family member have their own towel -- even if they aren't exhibiting symptoms -- to prevent the potential spread of germs. 

>How often you wash towels also depends on how they're dried after usage. If towels find themselves on the floor, the lack of air circulation will cause bacteria to grow quickly. To prolong the life of your towel, be sure to place damp towels on a towel rack. Better yet, crack open a window or turn on the fan to reduce moisture in the room.

**TL/DR/4ADHD:** I had to remind myself to switch out my bath towels this morning. I don't know how long I've been using it.

*P.S. It is currently 8:20 am, I started writing this post at 7! It was honestly the first thing I was going to do when I got to work. I came in, sat down, opened reddit... I started with 1 browser tab open... 10 minutes later, I literally had 27 tabs open and 30 minutes had passed! SMH*

**Edit:** Formating r/skincareaddiction convinced me to dry my face exclusively with paper towels for the same reason. My skin has never looked better! If you are worried about having all those tabs open, maybe you should go to the nosurf sub-reddit and read about reducing and setting boundaries on your internet use. Good point Replace a hand towel after four uses? What? I’d have to replace that every day! Am I really this desensitized as to how often I should change my towel? I change my hand towel about once a week with probably 6 uses per day. I am starting a list of “when did I last,” with the date whenever I do this kind of stuff. I will add sheets and towels to the list—thanks for the reminder! Huh, I usually change towels and sheets when I can’t recall how long it’s been since last time. Or rather, that’s when I start thinking that it should be done...
This could probably use some scheduling. You know what's funny? Like last year I stopped using bar soap on my face and my face got a lot better. I'm assuming it's cause it was stripping my face of essential oils and damaged the skin. But for like the past 6 months my acne has been great I don't really get much any more. It's probably just cause I'm growing out of it though I turned 18 back in May and I think I'm just getting over that hormonal acne period. It's fucking great cause my self confidence is so much better This is very timely lol. The back of my head, neck and shoulders were super itchy when I woke up today, so washing my bedding is on the to-do list. I live in a basement and the post-Hurricane Florence humidity was too much for my dehumidifier and window AC to keep up with. Now I think I'll throw in my towels, too! May I recommend muslin cloths? They're very thin, and you can buy packs of 10 for literally like $1-2 on eBay, and it's much gentler on your skin than paper towels!!

I just use one once and throw it straight in the wash basket, it's super convenient! Thanks, never knew something like that existed. Lol, yeah. The hand towel one definitely got me too. I don't change that one as often as I should. I too should make such a list! Thanks for mentioning that. That's great! Lol, this is why r/ADHD is the best sub on Reddit. Excellent tip! Thanks!  Great advice!
