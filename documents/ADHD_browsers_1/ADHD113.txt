Google Chrome & Firefox both running with about 25-30 tabs each Friends! What the hell is wrong with me. I've been on Vyvanse almost 2 years now and I swear the rabbit hole if browsing and finding other links I want to check out as well is worse when medicated. I turn one technology article into a browser with 30 tabs open! Lol.  Get onetab
 Only 30? xD
