Just can't get going Hi there! I'm having some big time motivation issues.  I'm kind of overwhelmed,  I'm going to school part-time, working 4 days a week and have 2 tweens at home- to say the least it's busy!  I find that I just can't get my brain to engage to do homework, catch up on work etc.  - as soon as I sit at the computer I get distracted by internet.  Usually I can pull myself back into it and once I get going I'm fine but that's just not happening.  It's giving me panic attacks that I'm going to fail or get fired!  Any tips or thoughts would be great!  (I've tried pomodoro, clearing out my space, setting aside time, making lists & breaking down tasks, I can't turn off the internet as I need it to do the work) I've struggling so bad with this, too. Finally, after a weekend of getting nothing done, yet having massive amounts to do, I pulled out Ari Tuckman's workbook. I'm working on the chapter about self-activation. I'm not sure it's all that useful, but maybe it is by making me more aware of what I'm doing and laying out strategies that I could force myself to do... if I had even the slightest motivation. ugh. 

Here's a link to workbook (free) http://bookzz.org/book/2542098/23ae5c 

 Do you have ADHD? Are you on medication? You have listed what I find effective for me, but I also use browser add-ons that track my time and lock my browser when it becomes excessive. Helps me to skype-with people (muted) pomodoro style ... forces me to step away, keeps me on track (seeing someone on Skype actually working on stuff) ... and motivates me to show up since we ramble like adhd'ers during the 5 min' break ...  Thanks!  It's somewhere to start, at least!   I've been diagnosed, but I'm not on medication.  What browser addons do you use?
