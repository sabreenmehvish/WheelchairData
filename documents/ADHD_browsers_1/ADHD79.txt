Browsing with too many tabs, can you relate? I sort of became aware of this "problem" way back before the browsers had multiple tabs and the PC would lag you to suicide if you opened more windows.
Back then I used to bookmark *everything* after having been deeply engaged in something, but lost interest, telling myself "Oh I will definitely read that later!" which rarely happened. 


Today that my comp can handle as many tabs as I want I *always* have at least 50 tabs open if I sit on the comp all night. As of right now (only been at comp for 1.5 hours) I have 31 tabs open.... *Sometimes* I go back and read more, but usually not.


Can anyone relate?
Everyone always tells me that they don't understand how I can multitask 50 things at a time and think I'm some sort of genius because of it, while in reality it's just that I got bored with the subject and needed a new one  [deleted] When I'm researching, I keep it to ten tabs at a time, but paste the worthy links into a word file and close tabs after I've sorted them into 'worth it' or 'dumb'  Then I go back and take notes on the ones that were worth my time. Every Damn day. at least you guys are smart enough to use tabs. I open a whole new page. it drives my poor hubby batty. he is a graphic designer and always keeps his desktop clean. unfortunately my desktop looks like my desk top.  I always have hundreds of open tabs, and dozen of windows. Does not perceive this as any sort of problem. Yet of course it is require right tools to manage. Up to now there was such tools only in Firefox, but the downsides that it is by himself is not being very able to handle such many tabs.

So i wrote my own instrument for Chrome, it's kinda popular, take look:  
**TabsOutliner**

[a link - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/...](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl) I had a brief stint where my solution was to sort it out ish by using Mozilla and chrome. One for fun and one for productivity... Kinda helped I had like 200 tabs open researching a paper......my computer hated me......I normally have like 30 tabs open. The only reason I closed the 200 tabs was a memory leak developed at some point and I was using 98% of my ram :p Not only do I have a bunch open, but I leave them on for sometimes weeks at a time *and* I'm continuously flipping around between them.  Something to do with short attention span. [deleted] Heh! Thanks for reminding me of the days of having 50+ browser windows open. I'd do the same thing as you, bookmark everything and then never go back to read them!


Anyway, this is one of the only things that I've (largely) managed to stop doing. I finally admitted to myself and accepted that if I say that I'm going to read it "later," I never do. (I wish I could acknowledge this with other things in my life...) There are two pieces to this. I'm not sure how I did this, but basically, I generally stopped opening tabs. I used to open every article on the front page that looked interesting, all at once, and once I'd decided they were "interesting," I wouldn't close them until I read them, even if I got bored with reading the newspaper or needed to do something else. Now, I load the front page, see one thing that I want to read, click on it/read it, and then click (in the same tab) to return to the front page. Do I miss interesting stuff this way? I'm sure that I do, but I also realized I don't need to (and can't!) interact with every interesting thing in the world. This was hard to admit and internalize, but it's been really *really* freeing. 


The other piece was deliberate: when I'm doing something where it makes sense to open multiple tabs (say, searching for an article in an academic database or comparison shopping on amazon), I'll open interesting abstracts or relevant products in a new tab, but I won't click "see more" or go to the second page until I've "dealt" with all the tabs I opened from the first page. If I'm looking for academic articles, "dealt with" means downloading papers (or closing the tabs); if I'm shopping, I'll read reviews and decide if something is a possibility (leave tab open) or not (close tab) before I go to the second page of options. I started doing this because I would put tons of time into finding the "right" stuff to look at but then not look at it or get any useful information out of it, meaning I'd wasted that time and I'd get really angry at myself, especially when it was something that I'd have to redo later. I get a lot more out of spending 20 minutes examining five things closely than spending 20 minutes opening 50 tabs that I'll need to revisit later because I actually do need the information! TabCounter says I currently have 267 open. Of course, some of those have been open since last year and I just haven't gotten around to bookmarking them on Delicious. But I've read all of them...that's good, right? This made me laugh out loud when I saw it... I generally run multiple windows with around 7-10 tabs each (one window for personal, one window for school, etc)... Due to using Chrome as my primary browser on all my PCs/phones/tablets, I have a bad habit of finding something I'd like to read later and leaving it open on that machine, so that I can later open it on _another_ machine somewhere else to read it.

Wanna guess how often I remember to go back and read that tab I left open at work so I could read that night at home? I just recently started tackling this a,LNG other things. I'm starting to use lists and reminders for everything, time based items with alarms, etc.

For tabs I started using [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/). I can send stuff from safari, chrome, mobile safari, ie, doesn't matter and then pull it up wherever I am when I need to get back to it. I sort it by tagging with things like *read later*, *how to*, *for project X*. I'm usually down to 2 windows with 10-15 tabs on 2 workspaces (osx) most of those being my network management systems or project specific documents. 

Now if only I could find a way to keep track of all my ssh tabs... I just posted a comment related to this, then searched for other info on Reddit about having many tabs open and found this.  


**[Check out my comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismmobile/comments/1jac2z/why_is_the_the_god_delusion_by_dawkins_listed_on/cbsqhag)** as there are many ways of dealing with many tabs.  


Sometimes when I have lots of tabs open that I hadn't looked at in days, I just close my eyes and click the "X" of the browser.  Or I'll right-click on a tab first and choose "Bookmark all tabs".  (*I keep a bookmark folder called "All tab saves" and name the all-tabs save-subfolder with the date and any topic I was researching/reading about.*)   I wonder why we never learn!?

I've been doing it for *years* and still do the exact same thing over and over. And it's frustrating because sometimes I will remember one specific thing I wanted to check out further and it'll be burried inbetween 40 others and I can't find it.

And holyshit when one of them suddenly have audio playing, good luck finding and closing that. Rather than pasting links, I just have a lot of different "Bookmarks" folders, and save pages there, then periodically go through and clean them out. Makes me more likely to remember stuff, too. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismmobile/comments/1jac2z/why_is_the_the_god_delusion_by_dawkins_listed_on/cbsqhag?context=1) how and why I use multiple tabs.   Haya, I was [just discussing this](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismmobile/comments/1jac2z/why_is_the_the_god_delusion_by_dawkins_listed_on/cbsqhag?context=1).  


Your Chrome extension, TabsOutliner, looks pretty awesome.  I'm going to give it a try.  

Thanks! I have 4 browsers installed.

I.E., Chrome, Mozilla and Opera, sometimes I have 50+ tabs on each of them if I use the PC 2-3 days without shutting it off. 

I'm fucked,( Thanks. I will try that out, I am desperately needing *some* kind of restriction.
I have to uninstall my other browsers too, otherwise I will just open them when the limit kicks in.

It's weird how I can set restrictions free willingly on myself, but already know now that if I don't take extra measures I will just open Opera, or Mozilla and continue there. lol A lot of the time, I'm "saving for later reading" in the extra tabs... If some advert is playing I'd usually just close the whole browser and start from scratch. I've found the function in chrome "Close all tabs to the right" to be very useful in eliminating a little bit of clutter.

We probably will never learn, I do it with more than tabs though. I will sometimes fill my taskbar with running applications that I don't really need, and actually this influenced my new computer purchase. I went with a build for more multitasking. Do you do as I do and find the same page on a few tabs? Sometimes after opening a few I forgot I had one open already to go back to and just end up back there again. 

reddit is horrible for this, at times I have 5 or more front pages open at once. It 's pretty easy if you open up a few comment pages in tabs before checking them out and then clicking on links inside the comments, checking comment replies and so on. Yes. Like 10 of my tabs are reddit and often a lot of them are all the front page.... Sometimes I'll find the same tab on different monitors. I panic because I'm never really sure which one I was most recently on, its.... annoying.
