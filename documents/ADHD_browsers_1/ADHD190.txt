ADHD and telephones/smartphones I have a habit to be playing with my phone a lot. And with a lot I mean: from the moment I come home until I go to bed.

I realise I do this because a phone gives my brain some rest because it doesn't give me all those prikkels, and I can switch like a maniac between apps, which is also 'good' for my concentration/attention span.

But currently it leads to playing with my phone for several hours. I mean, I could have ended world hunger if I put all those wasted hours in something really meaningful.
 
How do you guys handle this? I already have installed forest (an app that forbids you going on your phone, unless you want to have trees dying), but I use it less often than I should. I actually always think 'oh just five more minutes' and then it ends up being several hours. I also tried to get rid of some apps I use a lot, but for example I started to browse Facebook and twitter with my browser after a week, so that didn't help much.

tl;dr I mindlessly play with my phone more than I would admit (several hours) per day, how do you guys handle this?  Turn things on airplane mode, or use a package disabler to disable the apps themselves. I also have notifications for most things turned off. If you have an iPhone get the "OurPact" app! It saves me. Set up your schedule and you won't be able to access any apps during the scheduled time.  I don't have notifications for barely anything either, it drains too much battery. Do those packages also work on an iPhone?

I agree with putting on the aeroplane mode, but it's the same with forest, I want to put my phone away but something inside just bothers me ('oh just five more minutes, I'm only scrolling through my Instagram feed' but suddenly it's two hours later when want to put my phone away again).
