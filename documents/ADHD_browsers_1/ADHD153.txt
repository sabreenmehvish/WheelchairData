I found a cool desktop calendar that I think will be perfect in helping me stay organized. Thought it might help you folks too! (works best if you have more than one monitor) Here is the website: http://www.desktopcal.com/

I've only been using it for less than a day so far, but I think it's going to be quite helpful. I stick it on my less-used monitor and it spends most of the time covered by a web browser, but it is there if I need it.

You simply double click a day to write stuff in. You can also change the color of the day (ex. my psych appointment days are red because if I forget about it that's a $300 fee or some shit. So fuck that*10^12 )

I'm currently running an experiment. I'm pretty terrible at keeping track of how long it has been since the litterbox has been scooped (out of sight out of mind, right?). So I added a litterbox thing every four days (if that's too long I'll shorten it, don't worry.. this is better than on a whim cleaning though, so I'm trying here). This will really help lots of people. I am glad you posted this. I have no problem reading longer posts (really depends how long it is) I tend to loose interest if it is unbelievably long. I believe we should make a thread of useful tips and tricks and things that could help other people, and get it pinned by the mods. Thank you for posting this, I installed it right away and it's on my second monitor now. Great! That would be really cool. I just enjoy hearing good tips and helping people in need of tips. Should we start working on a thread? I mean It probably will be (longer than most people will like), but if its tips I believe people would read through it https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7br82y/what_strategies_do_you_employ_to_help_combat_your/?st=j9s0ej2j&sh=602e129e

Hopefully it gets attention and we can make a large list of awesome ideas.
