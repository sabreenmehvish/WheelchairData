They utilize your browsing history to customize an ad that will display for you in the hopes of gaining a better click rate. You got an ad for ADHD meds because you on visiting ADHD sites As stated, most companies use ad targeting software now. It doesn't just go based on your cookies or browser history, each IP has statistics associated with it. For example, if you start searching for computer parts, delete your history, and go back to a site, you'll notice ads relating to computer hardware. This is because your IP has now been "triggered" as a person who searches for this kind of stuff.

Each browser also has a browser ID. This is based on your computer hardware and username, as well as your IP. Browser ID's are computer based and network based. At work, 4 other people throughout the day use my computer I work on. I also noticed that someone on the network was looking up car parts one day, and I started seeing advertisements on NY Times for cars. I'm aware of ad-targeting, but I actually clear all my history, cookies, cache, Temp and Temporary Internet Files folder before very time I close my browser, and that was one of the first sites I had visited after turning on my computer and going to the Yahoo homepage, Google Maps, and the LA Times, and the Google account that was logged in at the time is one of a few that I seldom use and which I've only sent about 20 emails from, and nothing I have read, written, or watched has been directly related to psychology or psychiatry. Yes, it may then seen odd that I would have posted in this subreddit, but you can see from my posting history that I post in a very diverse range of subreddits, just based on whatever I see and happen to feel like sharing.  Ad targeting doesn't rely solely on information you can delete from your computer.  Your IP can be tracked and a history can formed based on that.
