What do you guys do for the browser pages and extensions THAT ACTUALLY HELP PRODUCTIVITY? Basically any time I have a browser tab or window open I know that it could become a new tab or tabs or even something more sinister like a robotic self aware killing machine... but some pages and extensions are really helpful like G spreadsheets or calendar or whatever.

Do you guys have any tricks for making me not fear the fact that my browser, usually chrome, or firefox, is open at all? Just seeing it in the taskbar sometimes is enough to worry me.



PS I'm a PC. For Chrome, [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en). Beware the nuclear option because I made the mistake of not allowing enough sites and then I couldn't access anything I needed for school or life in general until the next day. Also, once you turn on the Nuclear option, there's no going back.

It's a pain in the butt, but as long as you have it enabled, there's no choice but to get stuff done. I set it to allow me 30min on blocked sites and then not allow me back onto those blocked sites for the rest of the school day. Tab wrangler: It closes down inactive tabs and saves them for easy restore whenever you need them. Very smooth and easy to use.

I only use my computer for work, all my time wasting is done on my phone or tablet. I'll spend hours on reddit on my tablet.  OP just needs to not get sucked into the Reddit black hole and therefore does not want to spend anytime with setup or tailoring to personal habits. OP wasn't going to get any work done anyways so doesn't really matter if work stuff is blocked. Lol

For sure though, you are right.  [Here's a version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spec.stayfocused1) for Android that I found after a quick Google Search. It blocks apps, texts and calls :) OP needs to write in the first person. OP will not get many replies with such convoluted articles. [removed] Installed TY

Also "Locker for Study" Oh I thought I was in a different thread. This had me confused all day. Edit lel [**this is the post I through I was in]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/22k6s4/getting_desperate_i_need_an_intervention/cgo2gls?context=3)

Note : OP took my advice and had *great success!* with it  You legitimately had me thinking for a second that I posted my fitness progress picture URL instead of the Google Play Store URL and gave me a mini heart attack since it's been there for 3 hours.

**Side note:** nice legs confirmed.
