Adult male, 32 yo. Started medication today (18mg Concerta, to go up to 36mg next week). Will update this post regularly with results/symptoms of medication **22/7/2015**: So I started Concerta this morning. I'm already feeling a very subtle but clear boost in motivation to work on my master's thesis and address the problems that have built up in my life over the last months: no motivation to work, constantly feeding procrastination habits with Reddit, writing, guitar, and other non-work related interests. Also, due to feeling depressed about my inability to work, I have dropped out of contact with people and have been self-isolating a lot.

The medication seems to act as a very subtle "get up and do it" feeling. I am keeping a notebook with checklists of the things I need to do: project work, job applications, even phoning the landlord and so on. For the last while, I tried checklists and simply had no desire to do the things I set out to do. That seems to have changed very quickly this morning with the Concerta.

I've been exercising rigorously every morning, taking fish oil, iron and multi-vitamin supplements, and trying to regulate my sleep (still not getting enough sleep from staying up late). However, none of this made any difference without medication - I felt good from the exercise and so on, but still had no motivation.

I'll update this post with insights into how the medication has worked out for me, as a diary for myself but also for other adults who are consideration medication or Concerta specifically. Comments welcome.

**23/7/2015**: I have to say, day 1 yesterday was a surprising success. I was expecting the drugs to work, but not so quickly. I worked through 2 tough video lectures and read a paper - the extra motivation also pushed me to reach out to some people with issues I had been putting off. The whole day, I felt a great desire to get things done - I even cooked early dinner for me and my wife at 6pm (I usually put dinner off til later).

Now, I have to allow the possibility that some part of this is placebo - the thought that the medication will change things has given me a natural boost in motivation. However, things I have tried in the last months that I thought would work had no such "placebo" effect (e.g. modafinil), so I attribute a great part of it to the Concerta.

A note about coffee: I had 3 cups of coffee yesterday, and after the third, it was too much - I was whizzing at my desk and I had to get up and go for a run because the energy was too much. I was very focused, but over-stimulated. At that point I also felt very slight nausea, but no vomiting. I am switching to red tea with milk from today (I don't think I can bring myself to fully drop caffeine).

I didn't get a full night's sleep: I fell asleep at 1AM, and woke up at 6:45AM, not able to get back to sleep. I'm hoping I will adjust and still be able to get 7-8 hours sleep a night.

I had no comedown at night, although I certainly could feel the medication had worn off. I went to the supermarket at 930PM, bought some things, left the supermarket, then realised I had forgotten the thing I was actually supposed to buy. I went back in and bought it, but then forgot my papers at the counter, so had to go all the way back a third time! Lesson: your ADHD brain will remain your ADHD brain :)

**24/7/2015:** I had a full productive day again yesterday. The first thing I need was work carefully through a long mathematical proof I needed to learn, following a video lecture from Stanford online. I would say that yesterday felt like an early "peak" - I was very stimulated during the first few hours and more regular the rest of the day. I spent most of the day at the library studying. Having slept very little, at 6pm I managed to nap for 2 hours because I was exhausted. However, this made it hard to fall asleep at night, and again I've woken up quite early with only 4.5 hours sleep, and not able to get back to sleep. I'm considering buying over the counter sleeping meds today to fix this.

In just two days I seem to have gotten my academics well on way to being on track. I've done all the beurocratic things I'd been putting off, and am working on fixing some key relationships. I'm very glad about this - the anxiety my project has caused me in the last months has been overwhelming. I can feel my confidence building back up.

I have moved my vitamin supplement to the evening after reading vit C can interact with medication (this seems like a murky subject for non-amphetamine stimulants). I had no comedown or crash at night: like the previous day, I knew the medication had worn off, but it wasn't a negative feeling, and I actually still had some energy left to do a couple of (non-intellectual) things.

When the medication wore off in the evening, I had another episode of forgetfulness: I went to the library to print some things, but forgot to print some important documents and had to turn back when I was halfway home. This however is the kind of thing that happens to me all the time.

**25/7/2015**: Just a quick update today. I was very tired yesterday after only 4.5 hours sleep, and yet I was still able to do a lot of work. I went for drinks with my wife at around 9pm. I had 4 pints of beer and was a little tipsy, but I didn't feel the urge to keep drinking to keep my energy up. We came home, ate something and slept around 2am.

I woke up at 845AM totally full of energy. This is totally anomalous to me: after drinking, I'm usually a lazy sack the next day. I'm already motivated to start working, even though it's Saturday!

My work yesterday was steady and motivated, but I came across a mathematical problem that I just couldn't solve. The lesson there is that there is no drug that will turn you into a genius.

I took no vitamin C in the morning yesterday, and moved it to the evening. It's possible that this contributed to making the medication release more steady throughout the day - I didn't get the mild euphoria I experienced the first few days. I'm totally happy about this because I don't want to use medication to feel euphoric, but to help me work, so the less I actually notice the effects, the better.

I notice myself feeling a little less interested in music (I usually have melodies playing in my head all the time and tend to write at least one song per day). I also find myself grabbing for my phone/computer less compulsively - I spent 1/2 an hour this morning speaking to my wife and watching the news.

Let's see how day 4 goes.

**26/7/2015**: Yesterday was a solid day. I settled into my work nicely, read 2 long lecture notes containing a lot of maths with keen interest, and did a lot of research and brainstorming my project. I have never in my life had this feeling of intrinsic interest in an academic project, without the threat of an impending deadline/crisis. It feels wonderful.

The sleep thing is problematic: no matter what I do, I can't seem to get more than 6 hours sleep. I took an OTC sleeping tablet last night, but I think that's made me feel groggy today, so doesn't feel like a great solution. I still woke up after 6 hours sleep, even with the sleeping tablet.

Apart from the sleep issue, the reaction to the Concerta 18mg has been totally positive - I think I've been lucky. Will have to see if going up to 36mg in a few days works better, or I will go back down to 18mg after the trial week.

I also installed StayFocusd on Google Chrome and uninstalled all other browsers. I have set reddit, facebook, and twitter to controlled sites that I now can't access between 10am and 9pm. I've tried this before, but I just ended up uninstalling. This time, I'm happy they're blocked and don't feel the urge to get access to them.

**27/7/2015**: 6 hours sleep again. I woke up after 4.5 hours but managed to get back to sleep. So at least that's an improvement on the previous nights.

There wasn't the same "zing" yesterday as the first days, nor today. This isn't unexpected, because no one can be like the Energizer bunny all the time. But my work yesterday was clear and focused and I must have worked for about 10 hours in total, reading, writing notes and watching lectures. I have done more for my master's project since Wednesday than I did in all of June and July. I will save the post n follow. Starting meds next month. 38 yo male. [deleted] I will follow as well, 41 year old male starting treatment in a months time.  34 year old male. I started with Concerta, 18mg extended release. It did absolutely nothing for me. Had horrible anxiety from it. Combined it with caffeine once (cup of coffee) and almost had a panic attack. Doc doubled it to 36mg extended release on my 3rd week and advised to stay away from caffeine altogether. Took the 36mg for 2 days and had absolutely awful anxiety from it. Stopped, went back to the 20mg (really for reason other than to wean off of it) and then switched to Adderall. Started with 20mg extended release and didn't get much out of it either for the first 2 weeks. Then in 3rd week I took a chance and had a coffee with it and it started giving me the intended affects! Something clicked with that combo for me so I've continued to have caffeine with it every day. I'm now in my 7th week I believe. Moved up to 30mg XR as the 20mg was wearing off too fast and I'd become fatigued in the late afternoon/early evening from time to time.  The only downsides I've had with adderall are that I had 2 episodes of extreme depression and apathy. Both episodes occurred on the weekend during the first 2 weeks that I took it. It might have been because I took it way later than I normally would have (being the weekend and all) so I was having withdrawal type symptoms. I was ready to throw the stuff out and just give up on a treatment but I stuck with it and now it does wonders for me. As long as I take it at the same time every day (including weekends) I'm fine. Sometimes I don't even need caffeine with it for it to work, but it does jump start it. I am no longer fatigued all day, I'm focused, alert, I get my work done, I am more helpful around the house, I am calmer, and my overall quality of life has improved dramatically. The other thing I noticed is that I am able to maintain eye contact when having discussions with others and not feel weird about it or constantly feel the need to look down or away. That's an incredible confidence boost for me and will only help me in my career and my life overall. Good luck with the Concerta or any other treatment you go with! I look forward to updates in this thread and maybe some feedback about my own experiences.  Does anyone else get so burnt out they get the shakes and then can't sleep?   [deleted] Thanks for posting.  I'll be awaiting your results as well.  I've been close to perfect with diet, exercise & meditation but still stuck.  Meditation usually helps the most.  Got off of Strattera last week due to depression I felt on it and can already see I'm less focused.  Tho not depressed, so it's worth it.   Sounds good. It will be good to stay in touch with you being in similar age groups. Me too That's interesting how the Concerta affected you. My first day yesterday was a surprising success. I did have too much coffee and after my third cup, I was totally whizzing and had to exercise it off. But I didn't get any of the anxiety you've experienced. If you react anxiously to stimulants, are you certain that your diagnosis is accurate? I have read about non-ADHD people reacting to stimulants that way, although I am certainly not an expert. I'll let you know if I experience such a thing, but I didn't yesterday. I certainly felt the drug wear off, but no crash or comedown. My doctor wants me to go up to 36mg after the first week, do you think I should request to stay on 18mg for a while? Yea I'm certain. I was diagnosed as a child and was on Ritalin (same drug in Concerta) for a number of years, but when I went to high school, my parents didn't continue to pursue treatment for me and I didn't either.  I let it linger for my entire adult life until just recently where I was again diagnosed with ADHD. In contrast to what you have read, I've also read about ADD people who react the same as I do. Even without Concerta I had anxiety so it just worsened the condition. I guess I'm a rare breed in that I have anxiety and ADHD. My sister in law is the same as me except that she takes Wellbutrin in addition to Adderall to lessen the anxiety. But since the Adderall is not making me anxious, I don't need additional treatment. I've heard that success usually occurs with either Concerta or Adderall but never both. I hope it keeps working for you. [deleted] This is very interesting and relevant to me, do you mind answering a couple of questions?

How long did it take you to build tolerance? 

When you built tolerance, did you simply revert to ADHD behaviour? Or were you still able to function better than normal?

Did you take regular medication holidays? E.g. one day a week without medication, or longer selected periods without medication?

I'm only on my second day and Concerta seems to be totally transforming me, I've reacted very well to it - so I want to make sure I get the most out of it for the longest time.
