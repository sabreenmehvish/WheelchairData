Considering a browser extension to help focus? (If there have been several posts like this, I will remove and check out the other ones)

I am trying evernote but it isn't stopping me from going onto 'bad' websites like social networking. Some suggestions are stayfocusd, HabitRPG, etc. 

My question is: does anyone have experience with these applications, have they worked? Or if not, any other tips and suggestions for a struggling student. Thanks I started using the pomodoro technique yesterday, and it really helped lots. I downloaded a desktop timer which helps me keep track of how long I have till my next break. Honestly, it works like a charm, try that perhaps? 

Once I get to campus, I'll update you on what the desktop app is called.  Guilt yourself by using a program like [Procrastitracker](http://procrastitracker.com/). 

This is what I use to track my time. It won't stop you from actually doing other things, but I make a habit to look at my time every day for the tasks I've done. If I browse the internet more than work, I dun fucked up.  stayfocusd worked very well for me, for a while. Then I got used to open firefox or even IE when i wanted distraction... still works a bit: i cant impulsively check useless websites anymore. 
I suggest using the nuclear option (blocking distracting websites for a predetermined number of hours).  since this is ADHD land i figured i'd leave a comment here so you'd remember to post the link A different approach, I'll have a look :) Thanks Thankies ! This is the one I tried.  http://tomato-timer.com/  I really like the way the site was built.

However, its the whole concept that doesn't seem to be working for me.    I can't quite figure out why; Its too ridged or something. Here is the link for the one I'm using
