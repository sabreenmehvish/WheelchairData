Hyperfocusing: how do you practice moderation? I didn't know there was a name for this until recently! I've always just assumed everyone had stuff they couldn't pull themselves out of but apparently not.

If you shake me and I do come out of it I'm irrationally angry - how dare you tell me to go to work, I only have 20 chapters left!

I guess it's just gonna be one more thing I have to go to war with my brain about.  I am currently struggling with this by being on reddit. Reddit is...
