How do I prepare for a psych appointment, and how do I chose the right one? Since forever I've had issues with zoning out for hours, have this tremendous brain fog that verges on the side of making me feel physically dizzy, have had bouts of depression throughout my young adult life and have zero concept of time. Have horrible memory and just a negative outlook on things in general. 

For the sake of being humble I should say I don't know what's wrong, but i'm actually pretty sure it's attention related. 

Question one: How do I prepare myself for an interview with a psychiatrist? Should I make a list of things that I experience as being negative? 

My problem is that I seem to be rather successful in general (relationship, work, plans for the future, ...) so I'm by no means an acute case. I'm doing fine but I just really feel my functioning is seriously hampered. How do I engage a psychiatrist for this? 

Question two: How do I find the right person or clinic? I was on the phone with an ngo that offered counsel for people with attention disorders and they've given me three psychiatrists in my area. How do I pick the right one to make an appointment at? What should I look for? Right now; One is government funded and has a year long waiting list. Another one is a private center that has a very short waiting list and a very nice website with lots of information on various cognitive disorders. Google reviews has 3 very positive reviews and one guy describing it as a 'diagnosis factory' so I'm a bit scared of the whole 'way to many people get diagnosed and medicated' stigma. The third one is a private psychiatrist that seemed professional and kind over the phone, but my previous experience with such a counsellor ended up in me being frustrated about not having my original question answered (Do i have an attention disorder? What the hell is wrong with me? ) because I seemed to be doing quite alright (job, relationship, not depressed atm, quite happy) and there were always month long gaps in between appointments. 

**TLDR;** 

I am happy, but something's wrong or different and I don't know how to go about dealing with this. This whole psychiatric world seems complicated and I don't know how to deal with it. Help. 


**EDIT**

Since this web browser window has done an excellent job of keeping me from doing my work and provided a lot of time for deep introspection I wrote up something I'd take to a psych counsellor in an attempt to explain what's wrong. I thought I'd share. Be warned, it's an absolute wall of text. At this point I feel I either have some kind of brain tumor or injury, or I'm completely and utterly imagining this. Like it being some kind of imagined disorder and I'd make great material for a Louis Theroux documentary. Other than that I feel profoundly confused and just, I don't know, lost. The good news being that what's left of my day can now only go in an upward motion. 

So here's my attempt at describing what ails me: 


I'm a 24 y/o male and in fact I'm doing quite fine. Since I gratuated from a vocational college about two years ago I've worked in various places, ran my own business for a short period of time and participated in a few arts fairs. I live in a beautiful appartment and have a great supportive relationship going on. I have absolutely no reason to complain. 

So why do I want to contact a therapist? 

Since I gratuated two years ago I've seen various sides and nooks of the industry I'm in and feel let down in general. I'm not just bored with what I do, but I don't see a very bright future in it. I don't think i can get ahead with my current (vocational) degree. 

So I've decided to embark on a uni study and hopefully venture into academia and academic research (I am fed up with commerce, tried arts but couldn't make a living out of it) because I love to learn and teach. Since I'm independant and working full time to support myself coming up with a practical plan to make that come true is no trivial thing. And it's because of the difficulties I experience with doing just this that this old question came up again. What's wrong with me? 

At this point I feel going to a shrink would be pretentious, callous and ridiculous. There's people out there who are experiencing full blown depression and I'm complaining about not being able to plan the coming years of my life. What a damn luxury prolbem. I almost feel ashamed and perhaps I even should, I don't know. 

I'm also taking driving classes, and even though my instructor tells me I've mastered all the technical skills and seem to be driving like a pro, I've failed my exam three times because I don't seem to see what's happening in busy traffic. I can't focus, I zone out and my mind becomes a circus filled with anxiety about not being able to plan a plan-of-attack to enroll in uni again amongst other monkeys in bells. 

At this point, I seriously question my own ability to be a devoted responsible father. No doubt I's love my wife and kid (it almost feels weird to be thinking about this) but I'm filled with anxiety about wether or not I'd be able to support them well enough in practical ways. I mean i have issues with getting out of bed in the mornings and getting to work and other appointments in time. If i can't handle that how would i ever handle family life properly?  

Also, at this point, I've been working for a little bit over two years. I've never stayed at a single place longer than six months. I've ventured to arts and other disciplines, came back to technology and now I want to leave again. And even though it's entirely normal for young people to job-hop quite often, I'm afraid my newfound boredom and thirst for yet another new direction might just be a symptom of an attention related disorder rather than beautiful ambition. I'm afraid i might never find fulfilment like this. 

So, this issue came up again because: 

 - I find it difficult to make practical long term plans and stick with them 
 - I find it difficult to make choices and am just really chaotic in my ways of dealing with them 
 - Driving classes are really hard
 - work life is becoming hard to manage. 


To actually make a list of things that bother me: 

- I have this continous brain fog that hampers me in social interaction (I can't _really_ engage with another person), it makes me feel really confused (can't decide on which to-do item to tackle first). It's a bit like the feeling you're really focused and busy doing something (fellow programmers, you should know) and then someone taps on my shoulders and requires my attention. But I'm not actually doing something. In fact I'm doing nothing at all and i have this feeling I'm being sucked into a black hole all the time. It's on the verge of making me feel physically dizzy. It makes driving difficult. It makes getting places on time difficult. It's annoying. 

- I zone out, a lot. This I've had since early childhood and is a very known thing about me amongst my familiy. Sometimes I just feel like I need to take a break for a bit, just like if you'd just finished a hard task but instead I haven't really done anything at all (it's there at the beginning of my day), and used to lay down in the couch petting the family cat. And *poof* two hours have passed without me having any clue they went by. Fun fact; My cat would eventually feel bored and be the first to get up and continue the day. I would take a bath and just lay there for hours staring and doing nothing, again without noticing the time going by. I continuously feel the acute need to keep people at bay, like if I'm realy busy doing something that needs my full attention, but again i'm not really doing anything. It sounds weird but a person asking me if i have a minute really makes me feel anxious. Every added item to my daily to-do makes me feel anxious I won't finish it or forget about it. Especially the latter. My Google Calendar is a godsend. 


- I'm unable to navigate a car through traffic because of the mentioned fog and feel I'm a  danger to myself and others.

- I'm experiencing real anxiety and serious difficulty with any long term planning

- I have no concept of time or time-related context. an example: You should know you have a meeting schedueled at 3pm because some partner comes over for a demonstration of your product, maybe you should prepare in the morning? It usually goes something like this instead: 
    other person: Are we going by car or by train later? 
    me: *confused* What? where are we going? 
    other guy: Meeting with X 
    me: Of fuck that's right, what was it about? (totally lacking any sense of context, memory doesn't come up with it)
    other guy: You know, demo of product X. 

And then I usually end up going into panic-overdrive mode to prep something and afterwards everyone pats me on the back for the god work without any idea of what anxiety and chaos I've just experienced over the past few hours. 

It's like I can't see things happening until they're actually right in front of me, it's hard to explain. 

 Bro. I didn't make it through your post. If you're going to write posts this long you need a tldr. This is the ADHD sub after all.. Yeah, I must agree with squatsforlife... No offense bro, really... But this is a adhd sub. People will never read all of what you wrote. =/

I know it's sad, because you actually put effort on writing this. But we just can't focus too much on something not very interesting...

based on your TL;DR:
First of all: you need to talk to the pyshicatris BEFORE making your appointment. So you can at least have a first impression of him/her.
Only go for making the appointment if you feel like you "trust" this professional.

Also, it would be good to get some info about the experience in treating adhd, because a lot of doctors just "don't believe in adhd", and it really sucks to go all the way in your assestments just to get this answer at the end. Sorry my stimulant hasn't kicked in yet, I kinda glossed through your post. But I can tell you've given this way way way more thought than most people. 

Having gone to different psychiatrists over the years every one is different.  Psychiatrists use what's called a semi-structured interview, which is fancy talk for they ask the questions you provide the answers. No homework is necessary other than intake paperwork which they may or may not send you ahead of time (depends on the practice). 

There are specific criteria to diagnose ADHD and their questions will be directed at that.  One of the criteria is that symptoms were present during childhood so you may get asked about that. 

As for choosing a psychiatrist my rule of thumb is as follows:

1. Ask for recommendations from friends. 
2. If you don't have any recommendations, go with who is covered by your insurance and has availability to fit your needs. 




 Hey okay, you seem really anxious, so just remember a few things: 

1. A therapist is a highly trained professional, and it doesn't fall upon you to do their job for them. It's great that you're so introspective, and that will really help you along in the process. Let the therapist ask you questions, and just answer them as honestly as you can. It will take far more than one session to unravel your situation, so be patient, open, and honest. Try not to diagnose yourself. 

2. Choosing a therapist is a process that takes place half before you see them, and half afterwards. Start with personal preference: 
*A. Do you prefer male, or female? 
*B. Younger, or older? 
*C. What are their areas of specialization?
*D. Do they take your insurance? 
*E. Do they have reviews? Read them if they do.

Then you go talk to this person, and see if you click. It usually takes a few sessions to figure this out, and it's something you'll only know once you go. If you don't feel good talking to a particular dr, or it's just not working for you, ask them to refer you to a colleague, *I promise they won't take it personally*. Remember, they're trained professionals whose responsibility is helping you.  



TL;DR
When you go to a therapist, they know what to do with you, so don't worry so much about what you have to say. Choosing a therapist is trial and error, but the first thing you have to base your choice on is insurance, and age/gender/specialization preferences. Good luck! You're gonna be *fine.*

 No need to prepare since psychs are just looking for facts and not your entire life story. If you want to spill your guts out, a therapist or a psychologist may be of better help. Most Psychiatrists that I have run into are always in a time crunch, fitting 4-5 in an hour, and some charge by the hour. At the initial consultation, they may give you a questionnaire to fill out. If you want medication management, just be upfront and honest. If you want other strategies to help cope, you can try therapy or other resources. See if you can get copies of old exams from former patients I first made an appointment with my primary care doctor (family doctor). I wrote down all my symptoms which were almost identical to yours. I figured my doctor would refer me to a psych doctor but he just read my list of symptoms, asked a few questions, and diagnosed me with ADD.  Yeah, I should have heeded this advice because the person I went tried to tell me ADHD could be cured. Not treated - cured. Waste of time, energy, and emotional exposure. Now I need to start the search process all over again.  Thank you : ) What country are you from? I'm curious. Here in Belgium diagnosing a mental disorder seems to be a bit of a taboo. the psych doctor I saw was very cunning in avoiding the question. A friend of mine was also admitted to an institution that specialised in bipolar disorder without her ever getting diagnosed. It's  a strange thing here  Anytime man, and if you ever want to talk, feel free to PM me! (Keeping in mind that my mind struggles to read large, long chunks of text, but I'll try!)
