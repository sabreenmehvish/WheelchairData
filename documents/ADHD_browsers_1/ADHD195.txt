Is there a way to adjust the speed of youtube videos on mobile/xbox one? When using the browser I have the option to speed up the video, but there is no way i can find to do it with youtube apps.

Anyone have a solution? wait why on the adhd thread lol Because I have seen people here talk about how turning the speed up to 1.25 or 1.5 times the speed helps keep them focused.

I have been using the trick, and finding it very useful... but having issues doing it away from the computer.

So, since other adhd people use the feature, i hoped they would probably know the easiest way.
