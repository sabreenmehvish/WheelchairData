tools to improve your productivity with adhd - POLL Hi all, 
I'm looking to build tools to solve issues surrounding organisation and focus for people dealing with ADD/ADHD symptoms - I have some code that I've been working on but it would help me finish and publish one if I had an idea of which would help other people more. (Obviously I'm finding it a challenge to finish these without extrinsic force)

The ideas tend to revolve around **restriction** as a way of increasing focus and reducing distractions.

Please let me know if any of these would fit problems that you face: 

1. browser plugin - sets your number of maximum browser tabs to 4 ( ( or whichever value ) to prevent choice paralysis.
2. desktop application - disables access to certain applications ( also the internet ) based on a schedule that you define. 
3. daily to do - a resetting to do list to help you stay organised with the small things that need to be done everyday, includes alarms

thanks for your input, here's hoping something helpful can be made #2 thx bud, 
I'm starting off with a simple internet blocker - will let you know when its available
