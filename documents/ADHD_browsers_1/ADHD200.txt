Advice for untreated ADD, 6 years, PISSED Looking for some input. I am probably severe ADHD and want some reassurance. I believe it has made me spiral into major depression. I was on adderall from 2009-2010 but went off it because I had no guidance or warning.

My symptoms:

*Extreme lethargy/apathy

*Complete loss of motivation

*Can't focus on reading for more than 10-20 seconds

*Zone out during conversations/TV shows

*Poverty of thought, used to be creative but lost it completely

*Bored of something within minutes

*Sit around switching browser tabs all day

*Chronic fatigue, sleep 12 hours usually

*Poor memory, forget what I'm doing while I'm doing it, etc.

Will medication bring me back? My doc started me on Lexapro 5mg and Remeron 15mg, but I know this will do nothing for motivation and cognition. I really want to want to do stuff, but I don't do anything.

He is my new doctor and doesn't know about my previous ADD diagnosis when I was 12. I called him a few days ago to request a stimulant, forgot to tell him I am ADD, and he refused and told me to take Ginkgo Biloba instead and that he won't prescribe anything for now since we have to see my reaction to the antidepressants.

I feel so shitty that I dropped all my hobbies and don't accomplish/create anything. Thanks. First off, if you can find any documentation showing you were diagnosed with ADD when you were 12, that'll help speed things forward. Your doc might rethink giving you stiumulants if he knows you were diagnosed with ADD and on them before.

I'm not sure how doable this is for you, but if you could work even a few minutes most days on something creative, that would do a lot to making you feel better. Even 5 minutes a day is more then nothing. So the challenge is that a lot of your symptoms can also be linked to depression. If your doctor has all the information, including your previous ADD diagnosis, I would follow his advice for now, especially if you only recently started antidepressants. If you start too many new medications within a small enough time frame, it can be difficult to know what is producing which results or side effects. 

Are you seeing a psychologist or a psychiatrist at all?  Ty. I am seeing just a psychiatrist.
