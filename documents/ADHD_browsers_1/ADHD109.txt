How do you guys generally feel on adderall? I feel like I shouldn't have so much of my symptoms when im on my medicine but sometimes I do. Like short attention span, multitasking, one thought pops up in my head and bam a new tab is open in my browser. I don't think I need to change meds, (ive done that before) maybe its just discipline I need to work on. 

Also sometimes I feel more ADHD on my meds, can anyone relate? I feel like when medicine first kicks in I'm more distractive because I'm in an energetic mood and want to talk to people. But then even if I get off track I'm able to go back to the task and remember where I left off (compared to before where I'd go 'huh.. what was I doing again'). Then I'm able to get more and more focused but it's not a automatic thing I guess. I just started on meds so I'm still 'observing' myself lol Feel focused and motivated to see things through.  Can process analytical big picture things whereas I'd normally get sidetracked and off task repeatedly.   I feel pharmacueticalized, not natural like when i smoke weed. Kinda sweaty but cold hands. But focused. Maybe on ten different things and one new thing.  Its same cycle every month. Workout and meditate daily. Work and help my son. Get overwhelmed a few weeks later at the things i wanted done and not done. Tell myself a low dose of addy will help. A few days later i ate the month of adderall and had a fun night of drinking and then very tired from not sleeping or sleeping with eyes wide shut.  Like shit. Sweaty, irritable, no appetite but somehow still starving, cold hands and feet, etc.

Dexedrine is a fucking godsend for me. Super clean, clear headed stimulation that is almost relaxing and sedating to me, no physical side effects whatsoever. The 15mg spansules last about 12-14 hours for me and let me function like a normal human. Couldnt ask for a better med if i wanted to.
