What Do You Do With University Being All Online? I have a ton of issues combatting my ADHD in uni, and I’ve found that throughout the years in school I have only gotten worse, from pretty good marks and satisfactory productivity to ‘just passing’ marks, in fact I don’t think I’ve been able to hand in an assignment on time or even passed a midterm since first year (currently 3rd).
The issue I’m putting out there now is about how every. single. thing. is online, the place where all of us can get distracted the fastest with zero effort.
All this technology just makes it so much EASIER for us to pull our attention away from what we are suppose to do (directly from a Thomas frank video). Within a millisecond I can go from staring at a reading or an already late assignment to clicking a tab on my browser and watching YouTube videos on ‘better methods of focusing for a student’.
Sure, I can get rid of that tab, install a program so I actually can’t go on certain sites during certain times of the day, or even download my readings and turn off my internet so I can’t go on any sites. But that’s not stopping my will to easily uninstall said program, turning on my internet, or just typing YouTube on my browser without much resistance.
I’ve been contemplating printing out all of my readings and assignments and lectures, writing everything out by hand and then typing everything out to submit online for marking, but am I really going to print hundreds of pages and spend more money than I have to in order to hand in everything one at a time?
What are your methods for this? There’s an app called SelfControl and it’ll block the websites and all of that but even if you delete it, the block will still be there. The only thing you could do to stop it is reformat your computer. I found that pretty helpful. If then you reach for your phone or tablet, there’s an app called Flipd which does the same thing, removes all apps for an x amount of time so you can only use your phone to call and text. Good luck!  I used to struggle a lot with this- I have gotten a lot better now because of these few tips

- Using a hardcore website blocker. I use chrome and have the StayFocused extension. The great thing about this extension is that you can actually block the extensions page( so you can’t turn off the extension). More at bottom of the comment for exactly how I use it.

- Pomodoro method. For this, ignore the 25 focus/5 break timing and just use whatever works for you! When I started I had to do 10/2 timing because that was how long I could focus. Now I can pretty reliably focus for 20/3 and 25/5 when I get into the flow of it.

- Turning my phone off. I shut my phone completely down and store it somewhere really far away whenever I need to work 

I think it is important to remember that are not just at the mercy of our ADHD. We can grow and improve our self discipline, time management, etc. It just takes a lot of time, persistent practice, and awareness of how our ADHD affects us and what our adhd pitfalls are. Also a lot of trial error of what works and what doesn’t.

Okay here is how I use stayfocused
I block the majority of websites on their recommended list of websites, and then I make except for websites I use for my homework. Then set up your active hours and days. Okay this is good enough, but if you are serious what you can do is set up the nuclear settings to turn on after you max out your time. Basically, this is like super extra blocking, and I highly recommended it. I spent the last semester of college with 26 hours of the day with nuclear settings on and it was immensely helpful for keep my mind distraction free. 

TL;DR: pomodoro timer, shutting phone off, hardcore website blocker I’m going to give that extension a shot, but I’ll have to switch from safari to chrome.

I have 2 issues with the pomodoro technique:

1. The break time no matter how long I give myself always throws me off. I can’t set a frame of mind to start a break and then get out of it to focus.
2. I can’t concentrate on command. I can’t sit and tell myself, ‘I will only focus on my work for x minutes’. If I had to break it down, it’s as if my mind is either on or off, on being all of my thoughts and off being staring blankly at a screen. Concentration and energy comes spontaneously and it’s never when I’m in a working environment, or when my mind is off. I hope it works out for you!

1. This is really hard- I find it difficult to get back on track too! What helps me is to have non distracting break acitivites( knitting, doodling, stretching), and a really loud notification for break times. It takes a while to get use to though. My suggestion is to keep trying at it- it has taken me 3+ years of trying at it before I could switch myself into and out of work mode. My first time using a pomodoro was a disaster, but now it really helps me.

2. I think you may find the pomodoro method helps with this. It really important though  to be specific with your tasks though. So for example, if I am doing a math assignment here would be my tasks:

- finish 2 problems in 25 mins
- break
- review equations and work out example problems in 25 mins
- break 
- so on and so forth

However, I think you may want to ask yourself why you find concentrating difficult to do on command ( and why you find it not difficult to focus other times). I would avoid just blaming it on ADHD because ( it tends to be a nonstarter since it feels like something you can do nothing about) concentration can be affected by emotions, health, and environment as well. I could see this easily being the cause of you feel stressed out about work.

I found keeping a journal where I just wrote down how I was feeling and what was going on was really helpful for me becoming more self aware. 

I also keep a pomodoro tracker in that journal too. It is basically a page with a time ( actual real time), task, and a next column. The next column is really great because it lets you reflect on what you did during the pomodoro and decide what to do after the break.
