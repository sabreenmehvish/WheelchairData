The Best Way To Stay OFF Social Media At Work???? So I have a job where I have to be on my computer 24/7. 

I really want to find a way to force myself to NOT get on Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc. 

I know that there are computer apps that you can download that stop you from going on certain sites. But I also don't want the IT guy at work to know that I am even using one of those programs. 

Are there any programs that you don't have to actually download onto your computer that you can use to stop yourself from going to certain sites? 

Thanks! What OS are you using? there is a browser extension called StayFocusd which allows you to enter websites and it blocks them or limits the amount of time you are allowed on them. it's not a program you install on the computer, just something you download from your browser's extension store and it stays on your browser i don't have a sweet clue, i know it's microsoft and i'm a mac user at home so i hardly even know what it is.  this sounds perrrrrrfect! thanks so much! i don't want to tell my work place that i have problems focusing or that i have adhd .. and i also don't want to get to the point where they notice how little work i'm doing. thanks! you can edit your host file to block websites https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/edit-windows-hosts-file-to-block-redirect-websites/ this looks farrrrr too complicated for me It's adding a line of text or a few (127.0.0.1 domain.com) to a file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hosts depending on OS), the harder part will be locating the file , assuming the user account has permission to edit system files.  

MaxOS, being unix-based, could accept "sudo echo 127.0.0.1 domain.com"  >> /etc/hosts" (That may or may not work)
