I was wondering what was slowing down my computer so much and realized I had 159 tabs open all at once I feel like it's the digital version of leaving little to-do piles all around your house (letters to be read, receipts to be organized, magazines that you've saved because of that one recipe you wanted to try) - there's so many youtube videos I plan to watch and news articles I mean to read etc. that I just keep open until I have the time - which I either never do or more likely I'll forget that I kept them open in the first place, all the while opening still more new tabs on the right that just add to the ever expanding row without ever actually getting to them (like the pile of unopened letters sitting on my drawer, shooting disappointed glances at me as I type this). 
They're kind of like the visual manifestations of my being unable to finish anything üò¨

Do any of you also have this perpetual tab conga-line going? Did you find a way to manage it somewhat effectively, instead of only realizing they are there when your computer starts collapsing from exhaustion? (Tips on systematically addressing the disappointed letters are also appreciated)

Edit: I use Firefox, but ever since they changed how bookmarks work and I lost the bookmark folders I sorted stuff in I'm kind of lost in that respect - do any Firefox users know a way to create similar folders after the new update? Pr should I just switch to a new browser?  Just look into some of those browser extensions that save articles for reading later (there's one called Read Later btw), there's the website Instapaper, also YouTube has a Watch Later list that you can add it to. In Reddit you can save posts too. I start doing that and my productivity increased a lot. If you use Chrome, get the Tab Outliner extension. It works sort of like the old Tab Groups feature on Firefox.  I can relate to this, and it‚Äôs worse because I have to take pictures of suggested videos on YouTube music tabs I‚Äôve opened (that looks like undiscovered pop punk bands). What you're looking for is probably Firefox with a tab a manager  or window grouping extentions  I don't use firefox (Chrome user) but I love the onetab extension because 

- it allows you to name groups of tabs
- it allows you to lock a group of tabs
- you can star a group
- you can move tabs between groups
- there are features like "send only this tab to OneTab"
- "send all tabs on left/right to OneTab"
- you can send tabs to a specific group from the window - not in the extension My life is full of things I'm going to get back to later, and never do, including tabs. 
There is so much I want to do, watch, and read but getting to it? Ugh. [deleted] Mozilla dropped the feature, sadly, but there‚Äôs an extension called ‚ÄúOld Tab Group‚Äù or something like that. I used to be on Firefox, but it kept crashing on me. It‚Äôs not really meant for having tons of tabs open, whereas Chrome is.  [deleted] No problem üòä
