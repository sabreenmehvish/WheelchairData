My Bullet Journal is the missing piece of my ADHD coping strategy and has made my life manageable Recently I had to go off my meds for a month and when I got back on them I started planning a strategy for getting and keeping my shit together while I had that initial medicated push again.  I had a list of things I needed to do, a list of things I should do, a list of lists and a plan to plans and binders full of disjointed journals and jotted down notes.  All and all, I was horribly inefficient despite my dedication and medication.  I was also weary.  I'm 30 and I always thought I'd have a handle on my life by now.  Despite managing to get everything done that needed to be done for my families survival I was still getting feedback that it wasn't enough across all sectors of my life. 

I stumbled across [the bullet journa](http://www.bulletjournal.com/)l by accident.  I'd long ago given up hope of the perfect system for me and was just trying to find one that worked.  After reading through the set up and execution for the bullet journal I realized that it was, actually, perfect.  Flexible enough for me to tweak but with enough starting structure that I wouldn't flounder and with the added bonus of check boxes.  I freaking love check boxes.  So I tried it out with an old notebook and went through all my old papers writing down important information and using the notation provided.  I threw away about twenty pounds of paper.  

The next day I started out using my new daily list, wrote down what I wanted to get done and kept it realistic.  I got my list done and added to it.  I got it done again.  I went out and bought a mead composition book with graph pages (I don't recommend it for a long term solution but for $2.50 to try a concept it was worth it even if I have to use pencil.)  I set it up, copied down my list of tasks and notes and weeded it all down a bit more.  I started to get things done left and right.  A whole week of completed tasks, neatly checked off, and a clear, easy to read list of things to do in the future are sitting in front of me. 

Today I ordered the expensive moleskine journal that the author of the bullet journal recommends.  When I first looked at the journals they seemed over priced, now they seem cheap.  $20 for good paper in a hardbound journal plus a technique that actually works for me is priceless.  I also recommend practicing for a month (I'm not going a whole month because it's so close to my other system that converting was easy.)  I also recommend writing notes on how to use it as your first page, before your index.  

I wish I'd have had this method in my twenties when I was trying to go to college.  I think my life would have been different and there's not many things I feel that way about.  About half of the information, resources, and things I needed to do got forgotten or misplaced right away and what was left was so disorganized I was lucky if I passed a class.  The stress killed me and I left thinking I'd never really be able to be successful.  In the years since I've learned to manage my life better but until last week I was ineffectual at best and a hot mess at worse despite motivation, optimism and trying and trying every method (which I won't list here because I'm on the longest streak ever for getting done more than I have to and want to keep it up.)

**TL:DR I recommend trying the [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/).  Also, wrote some tips in my post for getting started.  Feel free to ask questions, I'll be able to answer them later in the evening**

***********************************************************


Here's few additional coping strategies that have helped me:

**Egg Timers** - I find a simple egg timer to help me manage how long I'm spending on something works wonders, especially things I tend to get caught up in or tasks I have a tendency to wander away from.  There's no chance of getting distracted setting it like a phone and the tick keeps me centered in the here and now.  The simplicity of it prevents me from using it as a distraction. 

**Zero Sum Rule**  If there's an activity or website that I gain absolutely nothing from or it's value is outweighed by it's downsides I don't do it.  I don't currently have to block websites but in the past I've done it [via my computer](http://www.wikihow.com/Block-a-Website-in-All-Web-Browsers) so that it takes a few minutes to get the site to work again and I have time to come to my senses.  I also do the same thing with food and won't eat iceberg lettuce or white bread. 

**Sharing New Strategies**  When I try a new strategy for my ADHD I tell my partner I live with and my mother who I don't.  Both have ongoing instructions to tell me if my new method is distracting more than it's helping. 

**Repeating Alarms**  I have repeating alarms set to remind me of meal times and to wind down for bed and at a few other points in the day related to my daily routine.  These keep me on track and centered in my day.  I find they really decrease the likelihood I get derailed and help me get back on track if I do.  On occasion I use the oven's timer, too.  The reason is that I have to physically get up and turn it off and it's no where near an area that's a distraction problem for me. 

**The Morning Plan**  I start my days by writing down what I NEED to get done that's not part of my routine.  I stick to items that I can reasonably do.  Then I get completely dressed no matter what.  During lunch I evaluate how I'm doing and add the things I need to get done.  

**Shitty Tasks**  If I've got something I need to do that I don't want to do (like cleaning the kitchen.)  I do it as soon as I get dressed.  After I finish the one thing I didn't want to do I find that everything else is easier. 

**Realistic Expectations**  Although it's tempting to make a day plan for myself that is worthy of Wonder Woman I try to keep it realistic and add on when I'm done. 

**Incoming Information/Tasks**  When I get a new task/information, I write it down and continue what I'm doing and come back to it.  Otherwise I chase my tail all day, don't get anything done and get pissed at myself.

Edit:  I'm so glad I posted this.  I had forgotten that when I was a teenager I wanted to help other people with ADHD that didn't have the support I had.  It got lost in trying to be a college student and the up hill battle my twenties became while I tried to be med free.  Now that I've finally got a handle on my time management with my missing piece I'm going to try to get back on path and work towards that again.  It's been inspiring to talk with other adults that are struggling and to realize that I do have many tools I share with others.  This has been a wonderful addition to an already wonderful week for me.  Thanks! This bullet journal thing sound good, but tbh I will NEVER EVER maintain it.

If something like this comes in app form however... Thanks! I really like the Bullet Journal method. That's pretty slick. I've been using apps to try to do something like that, but I've had trouble sticking with it and for as much as I'm a tech nerd, there's something satisfying about an analog system.

Do you set aside time at the beginning of the day to make sure your tasks are up to date? Truly remarkable. I'm just getting my feet wet with this, but I think this exactly what I needed. I've been doing something similar to this, but in a haphazard and chaotic manner. It feels like when I first discovered and started using the Pomodoro Technique. It's enabled me to stay on task, and it feels like Bullet Journaling is the key to organizing those tasks. 

Thanks so much for sharing this; we should add this post to the wiki.  This thread will be my Lent project  This seems like the perfect way to fill in the gaps that HabitRPG leaves. HabitRPG is so good for repeated tasks and habits, but leaves no room for notes and other random things that need to be done.  I often feel my To-Dos aren't important enough to merit putting on HabitRPG, but a place to write them down just to remember would be fantastic.

Thanks! This is AMAZING info. :) Thanks for sharing! Wow! THANK YOU! This is my first log in in a long long time, mainly because every time i wanted to say something I was lazy to do so but right now I just had to to thank you (hehe I don't think I'll ever top myself with repeated words in one sentence ever again).  
I just recently found out I'm ADHD, at 25, and am on my third month of meds and this past week I had decided I needed a notebook for my ideas (stories, dream house, movies, trips, etc) even if they never really go anywhere. But I figured if I never write them down, I never will get extra engagement in the idea and nothing will ever conjure. I had uncovered a book given to me when I was 14 titled "The blank book" and was going to use it as a starting point but completely disorganised.  And this method is just perfect, as not only can I do that, I can keep a non frustrating calendar (hate having a day broken into hours and feeling the need and urgency to fill those blank spaces), and have all my lists neatly organized in one place. Plus!, I can sketch the house with straight lines hehe.  
Just got to save up to buy the Moleskin as from the description by the author it seems perfect, mainly the pocket at the back and I always loved squared pages as well. And the more organized I am, away from technology the better. I'm just afraid I'll end up doodling all over it and got to think how to go on about large topics like a small story. Thank you once more as well as for the other tips. Seems like you got this figured out.
 This is great. Thank you.  Wow. I feel like I have been trying to invent this my whole life, and came up with a close, but-not-quite-close-enough facsimile.  Thanks! Thank you for this! I've been making lists in notebooks forever, but unless everything I had to do was on one page (the page that's face up that I'm looking at), I would lose track of the stuff that was on other pages. I think the index could be the answer to that. I was actually considering using the system to learn how to write apps (but don't hold out for me because that's a long way in the future) because I think the structure lends itself to a learning project. I'm not sure I'd actually move to an app if I made it, though, although I'd make it available to others.  I think that taking away the actual writing and maintaining would ruin the functionality of the system for me and here's why:

You're going to run into the same problem keeping up with an app.  Time management and organization requires constant daily effort to work and putting aside time dedicated to doing it.  Even if you had an app that used this system it would only really cut out time with indexing and transferring tasks and I'm not really sure that the automatic transferring of tasks from one month to the next would actually be helpful.  Having to do it by hand forces you to evaluate and trim so your not just collecting tasks.  

There's also the problem of the solution becoming the problem.  The journal works for me because I can't make it a distraction.  I can only do so much work on it before the work in the journal is done and I have to work on the actual tasks.  An app customizable enough to use this method is also customizable enough to be a time waster.  A good system should make you more productive and not just busy.  These are, of course, just my thoughts on the subject.  People need to choose a system that's going to work for them and I hope that this one works for someone else as well.  I would strongly recommend using the app/website Workflowy. It could be almost peefectly adapted to this system.  I sure do.  I wake up, grab a cup of coffee, take my meds and sit down with it for ten minutes while I eat my breakfast.  After I do it I let myself check reddit as a reward.  I actually love using it.  I really, really, really love graph paper.  I have since I was a kid and it hasn't changed at all as an adult so I enjoy drawing my little to do squares and find the whole process very satisfying and calming, like keeping a bonsai tree if bonsai trees helped make my life more productive.  I leave it open in front of me and by the time the meds kick in I'm in a great head space.  The trick in there is that I keep my subscriptions by my zero sum rule.  I can't get distracted by stupid things if I'm not looking at them so I don't.  

I reward myself with internet time throughout the day when I get to check off a master task.  Then at 8:30 PM if I did all the things I was suppose to I get to watch a TV show or play a video game.  I save them for last because of the amount of time it takes to do anything useful in a video game and how long TV shows are.  I also try to  pick up the house during commercials for the next day so I can start with a clean slate.  At 9:30 I journal for a half hour and then I go to bed.  I have some natural enforcement of this schedule because of the kids and a lot of motivation to stick to my routine because if I don't the kids leak into my reward time.   I just looked up the Pomodoro technique and my mind is blown.  My mother started setting an egg timer for me in the late 80's but used it before then so there's no way she got it from the book.  I had no idea there was a name for it!  

I really hope that your bullet journal is everything you need.  Mine continues to help and holds my memory much better than my brain was doing.  Please update me if you can and let me know how it's going.   I'm glad you liked it.  I'm full of joy tonight sharing these things and talking to people who might be able to use them.  Thank you for letting me know you appreciated it.   I'm so happy you'll be able to use this!  The hardest part of ADHD for me and the biggest struggle has always been having potential and being aware of it but not being able to get anywhere.  I've always been aware that I could be doing so much more, I've even been aware of what I needed to fix to do it but couldn't find the right tool.  I'm so glad I shared this and got to read about how it's going to help.  Don't be afraid to doodle!  Just set a timer so you don't do it for too long.  Doodling is a great way to let the mind wander to places it wants and come up with new ideas as long as you don't let the tool become the distraction.  
 I see what you are getting at.

However I just got into the habit of religiosly maintaining a calendar, which is an achievementfor me. I need tools that work with that calendar (google one) not ones which will distract me from it. Agreed, and adds drag/drop simplicity to some of the migration/ordering tasks. I looked into this, it looks very exciting, however, I do maintain an online calendar, which I am unwilling to give up.

Do you think that this can be incorporated?

 Hey you're doing great. I like this. And thanks for posting useful, technique-based content to the sub. All the "this is SO EXACTLY what ADHD is like" posts are nice but exactly the kind of distractions that I don't need. I still use my calender for events.  I think I explained in another comment that I use an app called Cozi which is a family app that pulls from my calender, my partners calender and my stepkid's school calender.  I still fill out the month section.  Mostly I use it for daily planning.  Have you checked out any.do?  That's a to-do app and it works with your google calender.  I don't know how I would have functioned without my Google Calendar. Between that and Reminders (*especially* location-based reminders), I can actually remember to get everything done that I need (mostly). I recommend an app called any.do and cal that comes with it.  Thanks for the boost, this whole thing is feeling pretty good.  I'm actually getting so much done and staying on task to a degree that's beginning to worry me.  I might be a danger to the people around me if I keep being so wildly productive and actually accomplishing things I set out to do.  Even my relationships have improved.  My stepdaughter has actually started telling me she loves me when she walks in a room.  I was mostly running at about 25% before and now I think I'm at about 85% and a few minor tweaks to the schedule will make it closer to 90% which will be the best I've been in my life.  

I just want to spread this feeling I get coming this close to my potential.  I'm going to have to do SOMETHING with my spare time judging by how quickly I cleaned up three months worth of backlogged tasks and projects and I think it might be to build a website with all my favorite tips and resources from over the years.  I'm practically a library at this point.  I've spent the last twenty-four years learning coping mechanisms and working on myself and I really should share all that experience if I have the time to.
