LPT (iOS and andriod, free)! I've always HATED shopping in-store if I don't know exactly the brand/item I need. Realized I've been using this LPT for years, thought I'd share incase anyone else has this issue! **YOU CAN SKIP THIS PART, LPT STARTS BELOW UNDER THE LINE**. My least favorite version of myself is the one that's been tasked with going to buy what should be a simple item, but then ends up overwhelmed by the choices and price differences and wondering if the one that costs 25% less IS just as good as this other one over here, and wtf does the XTRA at the end of the product name mean, etc., THEN spends 2 hours looking insane and sweaty in one aisle trying to find brands/model names&numbers on packages to Google reviews on my phone with bad network reception because I'm in a Walmart. The normal person response would be, "You know you can return stuff and pick a different one...?" but then that means I have to go to Walmart again and wait for the money to get reimbursed to my card, and I'm poor, so...

I started doing this a few years ago and just today realized how it might help someone else with the same problem. It's the **Amazon App**, but *I don't use it to buy stuff from Amazon*. So on the Amazon app, there's a function where you can snap a photo of a barcode on what seems like *any* product, and it will bring up the top results for that specific item on Amazon. That means that instead of going to the website in browser (or googling), trying to determine which words on the packaging are important for finding the specific product, getting frustrated by huge non-loading webpages, distracted by the internet, hoping the star rating/review I found is for the right product, trying to compare the package word for word with whatever online, etc., **you can just pick up the product, scan the barcode with your phone, and have THAT product's ratings and reviews immediately**. And amazon already has the "compare related products" feature, so it's just LESS WORK. I cannot tell you how much of a difference it has made in my anxiety about shopping for stuff I don't know a lot about. It has saved me countless times from accidentally picking up the wrong product because the reviews I read were for a different version of the same product (like, Xtreme vs Xtreme+ at the end of the product name), AND from spending way more money on the "recognized" brand when the generic one actually had way better reviews and value. I recommend it highly, especially for non-food items!  As per the rules in the side bar, yes or no questions such as "Does anyone else" or "Has anyone else" (or variants thereof) are not allowed in post titles.  Please repost with a more specific question, such as "How do you manage this symptom?" instead of "Does anyone else have this symptom."  You'll get better answers and more replies.

We appreciate your understanding, thank you.
