Today's xkcd, I'm sure users here will identify with it.  I have 20 tabs I've meant to read later........ I was at a friends place once (shared apartment area I guess, I live next door) and I was on my phone and she snap chatted me. I was confused since she was right next to me. 


In the snap was me, with my laptop on my lap, phone in hand, iPad on the arm of the chair I was in. She captioned it "too much" lol 

 [Relelvent](http://xkcd.com/1106/) I work in IT, so it's not uncommon to have a million things running at once. Sometimes it gets ridiculous and almost unusable because of the sheer amount of windows and tabs I have open. What ends up happening is I run an update or something that requires a restart and go to far before I remember that I have so much stuff open, and then I have to close everything anyways. 

I guess I wasn't supposed to need everything open all the time... I've caught myself on my phone, switching to my iPad, looking at my tv, then looking at my laptop. All while I'm *suppose* to be studying.  I usually grab my computer with a goal in mind... Today I ended up looking at calligraphy pens for my mom and still can't remember what I was supposed to be looking up.  Today I checked Facebook on my phone when I was sitting in front of my lap top on Facebook.

On the plus side, I only have 10 tabs open right now. Oh man this is the story of my god damn life... Heh, the alt-text, too! I've got a plastic bin filed with half-read novels, biographies, and non-fiction...   
 I've been looking for this comic. So I read it, clicked random a few times, (literally under 5 times) and came back to this same one....

And now I'm back on Reddit. This is spot on if you swap news with reddit. ...In both of the browser windows I have open. I started keeping bookmarks to keep track of all the interesting stuff I need to read.

I have 4600 bookmarks... my life became so much less complicated when I stopped lying to myself about reading articles My husband says my tabs are like a sharp saw.  I have literally 24 tabs in 4 windows because I can have multiple desktops on my macbook pro I do that ALL the time. Ha. I'm kind of doing it right now.  [Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/add.png)

**Title:** ADD

**Title-text:** 20 balloons float away while I'm busy permanently tying one to a tree to deal with it for good. Unfortunately, that one balloon was 'land a rocket on the moon in Kerbal Space Program.'

I feel the same, and its made even worse given that most of my work is done in a terminal. If I don't have at least 12 browser tabs open and at least 6 terminal windows open, I feel like something is off. 

Its especially bad when I manage to find a long lost terminal window with an already active ssh connection to a server that I just opened a fresh connection to. HAHAHAHA,  I am in IT and I do the EXACT same thing. And to keep some sanity I have recently resorted to sending them to evernote if I haven't read them in a week.... I'm sure I'll get to them later :/ Heh. Cute. Right now I literally have 17 browser windows open, the "emptiest" one has 4 tabs open, the "busiest" one has 14 tabs open.

^^help. I do this on my laptop AND my phone.

Is there a way I can have synced browsers? You don't *read* porn, you *watch* it. [Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/overstimulated.png)

**Title:** Overstimulated

**Title-text:** My favorite thing to do at parties is to talk judgmentally about people who aren't there.

"What do you mean, 'No such file or directory'?? Wait. Oh. That's not my hostname..."

    exit *hifives*  My bookmark folder of stuff he left open (foldered by date) is getting large...
 Chrome. Sigh, [don't remind me](http://imgur.com/idabqno). I once rebooted a heavily-used shell server in the middle of the day when I mistook a remote session for a local terminal.

*Sorry!* o/
