The result of a particularly bad couple of nights: 226 Chrome tabs using 10.3GB of memory and 16% of an i7 CPU at idle [I usually run with a lot of tabs open (they're just like super-bookmarks) but once the tabs could no longer display icons while spread over a couple of windows (2 active out of 7) on my *ultrawide* I realised that this is a **problem** (and it was 4am and I hadn't finished most of the videos or articles I opened).](https://i.imgur.com/7ZmMta6.png)

Anyone else care to share their collections? :)

edit: I'll add that two of the extensions next to the tab count there - [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) and [Webtime Tracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtime-tracker/ppaojnbmmaigjmlpjaldnkgnklhicppk?hl=en) are essential tools if you want to combat time wasting in your browser. I **am** fully aware of the irony... Yeah... this is common for me, not quite 226 but I keep dozens open to function as bookmarks, because I get anxious when I have everything under control. That being said, the IT in my wants to say that the computer isn't technically idle, since some of those tabs are constantly using resources or playing music or videos or ads or etc.. but kudos for reaching this level of non-activity. I would freak out if I had to close all of those, because what if I need them later? Ten of them are from something I'm researching, ten from troubleshooting a problem, several from review sites, rabbit-hole information...what a mess. About 90 on Firefox OneTab is amazing for this. You won't open those tabs again for 5 years but they're still there so you haven't lost anything.

I normally do this on my phone though. Once you get to 100 tabs chrome just shows ":D". I never don't see that...
