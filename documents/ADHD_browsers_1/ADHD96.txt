Assistive Technology - Apps to reduce brightness/opacity/saturation of inactive windows I use the [Compiz-Fusion ADD Helper](http://askubuntu.com/questions/35106/backdrop-equivalent) plugin on Linux to reduce the brightness, saturation, and opacity of all but the active window, which really helps me a lot to focus on what I'm working on. 

I use both Linux and Windows 7 at work, so I was wondering if anyone knew of an equivalent application for Windows 7. The backend is definitely there in Aero, so I expect there must be applications to take advantage of it. This isn't quite the same, but I use [Clearly](http://evernote.com/clearly/), a browser plug-in, to turn distracting/jumbled webpages into one solid PDF-like document right in the browser. You can even set custom background and text colour and size. It's been a lifesaver with a lot of my course material being online. This one seems to require the use of hotkeys, which is *far* from ideal, but it's in the right direction.

A post I was reading mentioned that this program has that ability automatically, but is not free. Also, my experience with Stardock applications have been largely negative; they tend to be too bloat-y for me. [Here](http://forums.stardock.com/418643) is the post that mentions that it has the function.

I just loaded up this last one to try it out for myself while I was looking for this, and it seems to work fairly well. That said, it looks like the last time it was touched was in 2006, ~~and it is acting a tad wonky. It's darkening the Windows 7 taskbar right now, for example.~~ Nevertheless, it doesn't really get any simpler or lighter than this little 212 kb app.

EDIT: Right after posting this, I played with it some more and found out it has a nice little settings .txt file that, among other things, had a setting to stop the taskbar being darkened. Not seeing any problems with this little guy so far. Even has multi-monitor support! Thanks, that last one looks like I can make some use of it.
