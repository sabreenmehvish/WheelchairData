[UPDATE] Hey guys, I'm building a Web/desktop app to help people with ADHD. What would you want in an app like this? Hi guys! So the other day I made a post about making a productivity app geared towards people with ADHD, and I got an amazing response. 

First, /u/mwd410 has graciously offered to help me with the coding and such - and you can, too. If you're a programmer, you can contribute to the project on Github. Right now there's repos for the [web app](https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/Focusser) and [desktop app.](https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/FocusserDesktop) I'll add the mobile app repo later.

If you're unfamiliar with how Github works, what you have to do is: 

- Create a github account
- "Fork" the repository, basically creating a copy of the code in the repository I've uploaded that you can edit
- When you're done making changes, go back to my repo and submit a pull request - I'll then merge your code in with the main project. 

Not a programmer? Well, I'm also in need of a designer - logos and UIs don't make themselves. Drop me a line at nachogaminglp@gmail.com and we can talk.

There was some talk on the original thread of a kickstarter campaign - would you guys support this? Having money involved with this project would be a huge help for me. 

**TL;DR: [Github,](https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/Focusser) kickstarter and web design. Who's in?**

Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1dxs2v/hey_guys_im_building_a_webdesktop_app_to_help/ I want a fist that extends through the screen and punches me in the face every time I procrastinate. Such as now. Is there an issue tracker, as well? Or should I just add whatever the hell I want in my own fork?

EDIT: Nevermind: https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/Focusser/issues
It'd probably be nice to have a list of individual features that need to be worked on, though. Awesome. Thanks for the follow-up, please continue to keep us posted!! What language are you using for the backend? I've got some python experience and have just started learning Ruby/Rails. Just sent you an email :D If you don't get a lot of response for UI help, could you please post another message? I could do it, but I'm a rather novice graphic designer.  did you heard about Personal Kanban?

I think it does have really useful idea/rules for your create/finish the todo list app.  something i could minimize to the system tray but would pop up and make an obnoxious noise on a timer.

something that runs on startup and asks me weekly/daily/whateverly what if i've got some important shit coming up (otherwise ill forget to use it)
 ohhh requirements! I love me some good requirements :)

(I'll skip all the system shall/may crap)

- A task list which is sync able across desktop, laptop, android devices.

- Ability to attach task list to desktop so its always visible similar to Win 7 gadgets

- Multiple alarm functionality, and ability to attach alarms to tasks

- lock down system ability. Similar to Respondus browser (http://www.respondus.com/products/lockdown-browser/)

- system override alarms for time ie: no matter what is open at 11:00 pm it is minimized and a huge alarm opens and cannot be dismissed for a minute or 2, ensuring inability to just "go back to" what you were doing

- Ability to lock system and require password / phrase to unlock based on specific criteria, such as time (for those of us with ADHD kids)


I think a "toolkit" type application would be much more valuable then one standard app... also web sites are hard because its to easy to just close the browser and go about your day lol. doesn't do any good unless you are forced to see it


  I would for sure kickstart that. Not a lot, but some for sure. Have you thought about gearing it towards kids as well? Say picture schedules for little ones and easy reading for kids a little older?  Hey, I spent a little bit of time just sort of coming up with a UX style of sorts... also a logo. Sort of designed it as a website but it's just a style guide if anything http://i.imgur.com/Y41M8nk.png (click link for full sized if you're using RES) SQUIRREL!

Wow.  A team of ADHD programmers working on a personal task managing app.  Either this is going to be done in a month, or this is going to be on the back burner for a decade!

Jokes aside, I look forward to seeing progress. oooh I looove apps for that. and there have been none that I found too useful for ADHD (besides http://www.Sandglaz.com).

I would say that the main issue that I have is maintaining concentration on a task while using my smartphone! Too many notifications, messages, alarms, reminders, etc, etc.

I'm not much of a programmer, so not sure if this is relevant, but if there was an OS that would allow for me to do one task at a time, shutting everything else off, that would help immensely. Not sure if that is possible. But a task-based OS, if that makes sense, would be a dream come true. That would be awesome. I've been looking for ages for a decent desktop/mobile app. I can program a little but I'm not skilled enough to actually help. Is there a way to still follow the progress even if you can't help out? And I have android, so you don't have to worry about only being able to program for android.

Quick question: the desktop app, on which OS will it run? * An app that runs on startup and will allow me to add tasks for the day
* Push notifications/alarms to do your work and to take breaks
* Something that blocks certain websites like reddit (although this already exists, if you're a mac user check out self control)
* Clean UI
 just took a short term to do an essay. Aaaaand im still on reddit Django/Python.  Awesome, thanks! I don't care if you've been doing graphic design since before CSS or if you just started last week. Shoot me an email. Indeed. That's why it's both a web and desktop app, and there's probably going to be a mobile app. The problem with that is mostly that I've never developed for mobile, and even if I did I could only develop for android, since I don't have a mac to use for iOS development. DAMN YOU APPLE AND YOUR PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE  Maybe, but it's more geared towards people who are older.  That looks awesome! There's a design folder on the github page now, and there's also another designer that's working with me. Create an issue on the Github page for design, you guys can talk there.  It will run on PC, Mac, and Linux, but on Windows you'll have to install Python to get it to run (Mac and Linux have it natively). 

Any help would be appreciated - just head to [the Github page](https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/Focusser) and follow the issue tracker - there's all sorts of stuff that needs to be done, from programming to design to documentation. Sent! Screw apple, Android ftw :) Ok. Thanks. I run Linux anyway. Like I said, I can do a little programming, but not enough to help. Especially not Python. But documentation, now that I can do, multiple languages if you want. Can I contact you through mail? I wish, but lots of people have apple devices. I'm trying to be helpful here, not idealistic :P Yeah, absolutely. My email's in the readme on github.  Sent.
