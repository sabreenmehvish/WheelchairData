How do you guys deal with focusing on the right task? Ritalin can make me laserfocused, but a lot of the time it's on the wrong task. Like sitting down for hours reading about study-techniques instead of doing the actual studying. I totally realize it's happening while I do it, but I can't seem to stop it.

Any tips or tricks for guiding that focus in the right direction? I also have the Pocket app on my phone with a browser button on my laptop browser, so if I come across an interesting article but I shouldn't read it now, I can save it to there. It shows myself that I'll read it, but that I don't have to do it right now. 

Edit: autocorrect myshap >reading about study-techniques 

Is studying in a place where you won't have internet access an option? Talk to your doctor about CBT. I also just tell my boyfriend (or anyone) what I am supposed to be working on and tell them to check back in 15minutes and see if I'm actually doing it. Repeat. One more...

I tend to get sucked into whatever I'm doing when my meds kick in, so as soon as I take my meds, I put the stuff I need to work in front of me (like an essay prompt). I swear by the todoist app. As soon as I find myself wandering off I can just flip to it and its got my next task already lined up.  Mobile app is also really helpful when someone tells me something and I need to write down right away not to forget.

Generally, I'll only put 3 tasks into the "today" category, and if I happen to be rocking it for that particular day I'll pull in the next thing.  After using it for a few months, I realized that based on my usage pattern I only get three "things" done a day, so no point disappointing my irrational brain by scheduling 10 things which are not going to get done no matter how optimistic I am. **Taking a break and getting exercise is how I handle this**. The meds help me get to the point where I can follow through on a task, but they don't really give me the ability to stop a task through force of will alone. For some reason, getting physical exercise (it doesn't have to be strenuous, I go disc golfing during my lunch break) gives me the mental presence to recognize when I've been side tracked, and the ability to get back on track.

Additionally, **I have learned/noticed that my ability to perform certain tasks is related to my physical location**. My theory is that I associate certain activities with the room where I do them, and if I try to do to many different tasks in the same room my brain gets overwhelmed. The worst situation for me was in the dorms in college where I had my desk, my bed, and my media center in the same room. I learned very quickly that I could never be productive doing homework in my dorm room because I associate that room with so many distracting activities. The solution was to only do homework in the library or study rooms. To this day, there are certain activities that I can only do while sitting at my desk in my home office. 

Lastly, **just accept that it will happen, and practice making the distracted periods as short as possible**. One way would be to use multiple browsers on your computer. You could use Chrome for distracting/relaxation activities, and Firefox for school/work. The point of using entirely separate browsers is that when you find yourself getting distracted, all you have to do is close the distraction browser. Practicing this when you are not under pressure will make it easier.

Take some time tonight, open up reddit in a new browser, click on one link, and immediately close the browser. Don't read the link, don't do anything else, just close the browser. Do this 10 more times in a row, and then you can move on to reading the article, but closing the browser at the end of the first paragraph. Slowly repeat this process over the next 30 min, and you will be that much better at breaking the distraction cycle. Definitely use the website blockers.
(Make sure to set them to work in whatever "invisible" mode your browser has too.) The one I had during school was Blocksite. I know there's one that will let you go on a page for say, 30 seconds, and then kicks you off. I like that idea because sometimes you might need to look something up on a site that you have a tendency to get sucked into.

 * website blocker
* having step-by-step lists of things needing done and kept next to you where you can see it
* having a buddy check in on you at least once an hour to see if you're on-task and to harass you till you get at it
* having a general accountability buddy who you can tell at the end of the day what you did AND didn't get done
* Practicing self-observation (catching yourself hyper focusing on the wrong stuff) and self-control (close the tabs you dont need to be reading the second you realize it, before your brain can even be like "but let me finish this page!" or whatevs.  What?!?! Omg thank you!! I need this for life. I currently have like 80 tabs open! Nope, need internet access for all my studies. There are apps and programs to blacklist certain websites for certain periods of time. (Looking at you, Reddit and Facebook). I'm On mobile. Google it.

Also, have a to do list available. If you find yourself not wanting to focus, procrastinate by doing something productive. Often you'll feel motivation and momentum from accomplishing something and be able to focus on the first task.

edit: SelfControl on Mac [deleted] If OP uses Chrome, there's a free extension called StayFocusd that pretty much does the same thing!   That's right - forgot to mention: There are **plenty** of free options available, but this one will sync across multiple devices, and works for apps and other non-browser software :)
