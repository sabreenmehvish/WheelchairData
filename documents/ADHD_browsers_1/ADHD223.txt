SUNRISE: a good calendar iOS/Android/desktop app that's also FREE. [**iOS version**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendrier-google/id599114150)

[**Android version**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=am.sunrise.android.calendar)

[**Browser version**](https://calendar.sunrise.am/)

Sunrise **syncs all reminders and events** from Facebook, Evernote, Google, Todoist, Trello, Asana, LinkedIn, Office360 and others, so it's all in one place. (Perfect for those using a number of apps and programs to stay organised, Sunrise keeps 'em all together.)

Sunrise also has a load of nice **inbuilt calendars** to choose from depending on your country and interests (e.g. public holidays, sporting events, religious events, school holiday dates etc.)

#**TL;DR**: go get [sunrise](https://calendar.sunrise.am/) the fuck now it's amazing

^(**not affiliated whatsoever**, just very excited ^and ^*possibly* ^procrastinating ^something ^else) I used this for a while, but bailed when Microsoft bought it.

But here's a couple of other versions of Sunrise.am:

* [OS X App Version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar/id886106985?mt=12)

* [Chrome App Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sunrise-calendar/mojepfklcankkmikonjlnidiooanmpbb)

 Question - right now, I'm doing pretty okay with Google Calendar which pops up on my smartphone, connects to my Gmail and also synched the calendar on my iPad. What does Sunrise do that'd make it so worthwhile to download another app on my phone?  I use Sunrise and I couldn't be happier with it and helped me make big strides so far! 

Unlike iCalander, it actually syncs!
