Autopilot is a serious problem My SO and I were talking about this the other day. I would sometimes forget to put my dished away because I would go to dry my hands (so I didn't get the dry dishes wet again) and then since I had just dried my hands I would go about my day because I had just finished doing dishes because I had dried my hands. My SO couldn't accept or understand this his immediate response was "how can you forget in 10 seconds"  and I'm just like it just happens and he doesn't like that as an answer I describe it as being pulled in by my thoughts. It's like I do a thing, then my thoughts (or another task) sucks me in and I forget what I was doing a minute before. This is so relatable to me.  I really hope your SO comes around; mine is a bit more understanding but he still gets very frustrated with me. Walk into a room and forget why your there. I’ll go to do something and a text pops up and I’ve completely forgotten my task. Put a reminder on the door or something I do this all the time. Usually don't even need the text to distract me.

Also I love your username Its popular (;
