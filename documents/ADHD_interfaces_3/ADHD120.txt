Advice needed: Reigning in Holiday gifts for the kids I have a 6 year old, 4 year old and 18 month old. 

&#x200B;

I'm balancing holiday gifts especially since my two older ones birthdays are close to the holidays. For my two older ones I'm looking into categorically hitting interests, STEM toys, arts & crafts, and books. 

&#x200B;

I keep pooling the possibilities of what to get them to whittle down. Only problem is my ADHD kicked in and I feel like gathering and culling has turned into a project. My filters are waining for expenditure and realistic time needed to put into building, creating, reading etc after gifts are received.

&#x200B;

To compensate I've made a spreadsheet breaking down the total cost, cost by child, number of gifts per child and cost average per gift. Also In my mind I'm changing playroom layout as I travel down the rabbit hole of meticulous detail. I don't feel like I'm obsessing, I feel like I'm working out the details out of necessity which is probably the very definition of obsessing.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions? Thoughts?

edit: spacing block text for better readability It's a little obsessive, but is it getting in the way of other things you -need- to do, like work? If not, treat it as a hobby. If it's something you want to do.  There -will- be a  natural end to it. make an STD list.  Shit/Stuff to Do.  Do one thing at a time.  

Are you an accountant - I'm studying for the CPA and it seems like a lot of other people in this sector do everything in Excel. Thanks for the redirection.

I'm a technical manager in video production. I use to code Lingo and ActionScript before they became defunct so know my way around working with formulas. I tend to overplan, go into meticulous detail and need to see the big picture to feel I have an understanding... of everything.

Wish you the best in pursuing CPA career. > Thanks for the redirection.

I understand, thanks.  I went from computer science, to IT then full turncoat to Accounting and an MBA.  Now I'm working at a car dealership (not sales) but my tech roots tend to show themselves.   I'm the de facto liaison between the normies and IT these days.  Ha
