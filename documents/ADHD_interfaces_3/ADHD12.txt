Hey everyone! If you have trouble reading sense texts and would like an audio-reader for PDFs/websites, there’s an extension on chrome called “Read Aloud: A text to voice reader.” It’s helping me actually soak in some information without sitting around for hours trying to force myself to read. 

Hope it helps someone else xx 

EDIT:

So as an example, I’m listening to a PDF I couldn’t get through a couple of weeks ago and have learnt more than I did the first time, even as I’m fucking around on Reddit too.
