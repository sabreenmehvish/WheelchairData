Was studying for 3-4 hours, now mind begins to wander and I lose the will to keep going. I was recruited to work in a finance company as a Financial Advisor/Insurance Agent. The pay upon being hired is about $800 per week for the first 13 weeks and $400 a week for the 13 weeks after. Hopefully enough to move out and start a new life. I made some plans with my significant other on moving to an apartment and eventually getting married and living like normal adults.


I am required to pass the state insurance license exam, and complete the investment license afterwards.(Employer will not allow both courses and exams to be taken at the same time)


The Insurance course, which my mother loaned me $144 to pay for the *online* 40 hour course.


*I want to finish this course as quickly as possible to take the exam, pass it and move on to the investment license.*


**My plan for this 40 hour course is to commit to 8 hours a day on this course, and to get this course done with in a week.**


I found that there are 21 lessons in the online course in all, and 39 units in the book. I broke it down to 2 hours per lesson, 4 lessons per day.


**Here is the situation I'm facing:**


* I am on medication and cannot sustain focus for more than 2 hours.

* There are days where I am not motivated to do anything at all. That includes the course and other very important tasks.

* Forcing myself to focus on the course at hand makes it harder to stay on task, and causing my mind to constantly wander and not want to continue.

* Reading course material, especially textbooks are especially hard. The length of the chapter of the textbook determines my will to even bother. If a chapter is about 20 pages long, then it's hard for me to get started or even finish it. My mind would sometimes wander even when I'm reading, causing me to forget what I just learned.

* I cannot take good notes for the life of me, and taking notes is a huge pain in the ass even when I have to do it. Notes such as copying texts from the book or course material word for word gets boring and painful fast.

* My bedroom is the only place I can study peacefully. I can regulate external distractions easily when on medication, but it's the internal distractions, such as my own thoughts and daydreams are what's difficult.

* Pomodoro technique was attempted for 1 hour for a task, and 15 minutes for a break. Even during a pomodoro my mind wanders during a lesson.



As a result of this situation, **this has caused me to take substantially longer to finish the course than initially planned.** It's very frustrating and time is short.


I need some advice of how to sustain and keep working for at least 8 hours.


What am I doing wrong? And what can I do right?


**TL:DR**


* Have no motivation to continue course, even when I have to.
* Forcing myself to focus on a task when it's required makes my motivation to do the task worse.
* Have issues taking notes.
* Can't sustain focus for as long as desired.
* Has no idea what I'm doing wrong, and how to fix it. For starters, you've set an unrealistic goal for yourself in the first place.  I had the same thought process as you a couple of months ago and received a reality check.  The human mind has limits on what it can absorb in a single day.  

Trying to learn 8 hours worth of material in a day is unrealistic.  Even if you sit there and study for 8 hours, your brain will only retain so much information.  It's better to get 2 hours of studying done per day and actually remember the material than to get 8 hours of studying done and barely remember any of it. 

 So, I would suggest that you revise your plan and try to finish the course in a month rather than in a week.  Also, studies have shown that reading a book and taking notes or highlighting are not very effective means of studying.  The best way to study is to test your knowledge of the material.  

This means that after learning a new concept, you should immediately begin to test yourself on it.  If the book doesn't provide questions, look some up on the internet or create your own.  So, for instance if I'm learning about derivatives from a Calculus textbook and the passage I'm reading about is the power rule, then I should immediately start testing myself on the power rule.  What I usually do is create a list of about 10-30 questions and then take them in random order. 

Then, I start learning something new and do the same thing.  Then the next day I test myself on the material from the previous day.  I do this because the human brain retains information better if it's exposed to it more often.  Just like when you were first learning how to drive a car, you didn't just drive a car once and then expect to know how to drive for the rest of your life.  

Rather, you kept driving day after day until you got good enough to pass your driving test, and even then you weren't as good a driver as you are now where you don't even have to think about driving, the motions are just automatic.  So, imagine how good you would be at any academic subject if you were to revisit and test yourself on the material every day?  That's why our education system is so screwed up.  

Students are not rewarded for revisiting past material because once they get an A in a class or at least a passing grade, no one cares anymore if they work on that prior material.  So, students then realize that all they need to do to succeed in school is to regurgitate what information their professors want from them, then purge that information after the course is done and repeat the process until they have their degree.   8 hours is a long time to study, don't get to hard on yourself :)

Have you considered shorter bursts for pomodoro? 25min then a 5 min break?

Can you switch between modules? I find long study stints are a touch easier if I'm swapping between topics (or tasks) often. Read for 25, write for 25, type up notes for 25, etc.

Text books are boooorrrrring. You need jelly babies. Place them across the page and you get to eat them as you read up to that jelly baby (replace jellybaby with delicious treat/cigarette/wine/etc).

Instead of 8 hour at once, what about 4 hours early morning followed by fun/Netflix/nap, then 4 hours later in the day?

People say don't study in your bedroom but if that works for you, screw em. 

Prepare your study session: it's worth taking 15min as you start to plan what your going to do. I plan 1/2 blocks with lots of different activities. If you get the hyperfocus, run with it! Just take a decent drink/food/bodily function break after.

Hopefully any of these might help. I'll write something about notes in a sec, I'm supposed to be packing right now... ###Everyone needs breaks, meals, bathroom trips, water, stretching, exercise, and for relaxing and refreshing your brain.  

You might have to start with smaller Pomodorii and build up to longer ones with practice.

There's a [section in the wiki on studying and academic resources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/assistance)  Try the Cornell Notetaking Method.  Look at the Studying Tips.

Medication isn't a magic pill, it just lowers the 'effort' barrier.  You still have to work on your skills and techniques for getting things done.  Instead of trying to learn to ride your bike uphill, you're trying to learn to ride it on flat groundâ€”learning to ride it still takes practice and energy.


 Ask yourself what your primary goal is. Is it to be able to pass the exam you're studying for, or is it to complete the study material as fast as possible? Like you, I like to rush thru things and it took me a long time to realize that quick completion isn't the goal. As others have said, don't try and do 8 hours a day. That's impossible. Two hours a day is a lot more realistic, even if it means you'll finish in 20 days instead of 5. You'll retain more of what you learned and make it more likely to pass your exam.

And don't feel like you have to do the 2 hours consecutively. Do an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon. You'll do good! :) That's called fatigue.  Your brain requires energy just like your body.  Take a rest.  Go for a walk.  Stretch.  At most every 50 minutes.  You cannot will away fatigue.  It is fact and it is happening to you and everyone else.  Learn to work with it :) I've had a houseguest the last couple of weeks who is in almost exactly the same situation as you (regarding the insurance course and getting apartment).  I've noticed that she studies in fairly short blocks, stops to cook and eat, goes to the gym, and works on her other job in short bursts throughout the day.  But she has been powering through that book, a chapter or two per day, sometimes more, over the past 2-3 weeks.  She's taking the test next week.  There's no way in hell I could have got through it that fast.

Here's what I've seen her doing:

__1) READING ALOUD__, repeating key phrases

__2) TAKING NOTES ON INDEX CARDS__, to review them later

__3) EATING, EXERCISING, and TALKING TO PEOPLE__ in between study sessions.   

She doesn't isolate herself in "study-world" all the time, only in definite blocks of time.  This woman is *extremely* ambitious and energetic - just watching her exhausts me - but her technique seems to work.  She actually seems to use her ADHD to her advantage somehow.

Anyway, this may or may not help you, but don't give up.  That test is hella hard.  A week is too short a time to learn all that stuff.  8 hours is too long a time to study all at once.   _Take some breaks, eat well, exercise, and read the book out loud.  *Good luck*._ 
>* Have no motivation to continue course, even when I have to.

motivation follows discipline/motivation is not a requirement.  

practice doing, and rewarding. let the motivation follow but yeah. do it anyway. 

I struggle with this too. good luck!!! I tried doing 25 minutes, but it doesn't seem to be enough time to get things done. Plus I felt that 25 minute tasks just makes the entire course take longer than planned. What about 50/10 instead of 25/5? Maybe something like this:

Wake up, take dose 1 of meds, eat breakfast, spend 15 min sketching out a schedule for the day. Meds should start to kick in.

Set your 50 minute pomodoro timer. Work, making sure to quiz yourself like /u/darkside619 talks about. Timer goes off, take 10 minutes to use the bathroom, get a glass of water, grab an apple, check facebook, whatever. 10 minutes are up, another 50 minutes. 

When that's done, take an hour break and get some exercise: go to the gym, go for a jog, a bike ride, shoot some baskets, whatever works for you. Exercise increases dopamine and works almost as well for a short time after as medication.

After exercise, come back and repeat the two 1-hour pomodoros. Now you're halfway through, time for lunch. Take an hour, get lunch, relax a bit, take a second dose of medication (if you're on an IR sort of drug. If you're on an XR/LA that you only take once a day, disregard this). Then you do another two pomodoros. Time for another hour break. Maybe this one you watch an episode of a show on Netflix, play some video games, or practice the ukelele. Whatever you want, but keep it to an hour. Then you can finish with the last two pomodoros.

Something like that might work, where rather than "8 hours of work followed by free time" you divide your free time up within the work time. 8 hours of studying dull material is going to be *really* hard to pull off, though, so I'm with /u/darkside619 on the unrealistic goal thing. Remember, it's okay to admit that you've underestimated the material and modify your goal in the middle. That's not failure. Failure would be if you *didn't* make a change, and ended up quitting or flunking the course. Taking an extra 2-3 weeks to do it right is much better than not finishing IMO.
