Reading Comprehension learning disability along with Adult ADHD Really Sucks! It just really hit me as I went back to school to finish my Bachelors and I feel like the reading is never ending for my current classes, and everything is "Referencing the text you read"....But I'm over here like "Wait I read that!?".

Does anyone have anything to help combat this and retain things you've read? Meds don't seem to help this.

 Reading is the worst for me. I literally don't know how people can just sit there and read so much text if they're not interested in it.
