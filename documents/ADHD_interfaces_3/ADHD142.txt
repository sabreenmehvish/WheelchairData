"Mintisthebestcolour, manager wanted to have a chat with you in the back room. Can you go see him?" Internal monologue: 

"Oh my god, I screwed something up. Did I sell mismatched shoes? I've only done it once, but maybe I've done it more and I don't know yet?? Maybe I'm getting an official warning for something, was I rude to that customer before because I couldn't give them the 75% off discount they were asking for? Does he hate me? Have my coworkers complained about me?" 

Me: So you wanted to see me? 
Manager: Oh yeah! Can you start earlier on Monday? Someone's called in sick 
Me: oh! oh yeah, that's fine. No stress. 

--------------

Does anyone else go through this every time someone asks to see them? Why brain whyyyyyyyy

TLDR: My brain doesn't think of chill options when being asked to see a manager at work

 Yes.  Does not matter who. Supervisor wants to talk? Instant panic. Friend? Panic. Spouse? Relative? Child's teacher? Hair stylist? Unknown caller? Cashier ringing me up? Stranger on the street who may or may not be making eye contact? PANIC! What have I done! What do they need! Remember to breathe! This too shall pass! Be cool! OMIGOD I'M NOT BEING COOL I'M BEING UNCOOL I'M BEING THE ANTITHESIS OF COOL Yuppppp and that's because I've had a few of those  "your performance needs improvement" talks I have had to tell my supervisor that he can‚Äôt say stuff like that because it literally ruins my brain for the rest of the day. I can‚Äôt take that kind of stress. Mine was, bosslady is complimenting my work a lot, and is being nice, omg I'm gonna get fired.

Now working on my development to leadership üòÖ I live away from home and talk to my dad once every three weeks with the occasional family group texts in between. I usually call him to catch up. 

Earlier this week my dad texted ‚ÄúHi, how are you? Let‚Äôs chat tomorrow‚Äù

Immediate reaction? ‚ÄúOH NOES WHATS WRONG?‚Äù

Nah. Turns out we were just a week overdue with the call.  [deleted] Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, anyone???  Even when people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs nothing bad‚Äù I still think the worst I get this feeling with everything in my life. Part of the joys of imposter syndrome, I guess.  This hits close to home on so many levels.  Holy shit I do this all the time!!! My brain always catastrophizes and assumes the absolute worst when my boss wants to talk to me. 

The funny thing is, my boss loves me and is more than satisfied with my work. But I still do this every time.

Edit: I do have both ADHD and anxiety.  Just reading this and the comments has my heart racing with worry for others. Ugh. Isn't this a normal thing tho?  I think it makes sense to feel that way, because a manager will very rarely ask to see you privately if it's something good.  I feel that way too. I remember being almost frantic because the manager asked to see me, but my supervisor refused to tell me what it was about.  I was praying like crazy that I would not lose my job because of whatever this was.  We went into the meeting (manager, supervisor, and myself)  She told me what she wanted to talk about.  I gave her the full details of what happened and the context.  I explained how I acted appropriately and without malice.  And I ended up unintentionally embarassing my supervisor because he didn't even bother to ask me about the situation first so I didn't have a chance to tell him what was going on before he hauled me in front of the manager. Every single godsamned time, at every single motherfucking job. It SUCKS. Yeah I would shit myself as well [deleted] I feel like I make so many mistakes at my new job. Everyone has told me I'm doing great, but last week my boss sat in my office and explained a mistake I made, and then a few days ago I made another one. 

I have so much anxiety.  DUDE i'm conditioned to think this too! people act and say hey why are you getting so defensive? And then I just feel dumb. mint is definitely a good color my first car was..unfortunately a similar color Oh God  yes, all the time. I had to tell one of my old mangers that if he needs to talk to me to please tell me what it's about first, not just 'I need to talk to you'. I once found out that a fellow employee found out he was let go because he couldn't log on to his work laptop. Apparently, neither HR or his manager wanted to come in early enough to intercept him.

&#x200B;

Ever since then, anytime my laptop takes too long to log on or the login fails, I have this mild panic attack, "what if I've been fired!" Or if certain apps disconnect. Or if my work email suddenly goes quiet. Ahhhh! I haven't even had a single bad performance review, not even a lukewarm one. But still...!! EVERY EFFING TIME!  Just the other day I got a calendar reminder that my boss and I had our monthly 1:1.  It's always crazy busy at work so I reached out and asked if he still wanted to meet.  He goes, "Do you have anything? Cuz I'm good.  Oh, wait, we should meet, yah, let's meet."  Then turned out we couldn't meet for 2 more days.  2 MORE DAYS!  

Why did he *need* to meet with me you ask?  I'm up for a promotion against a few other people, to fill a single management position, and he wanted to review some stuff prior to my interview so I do well.

Every *EFFING* time! Just about every damn time yeah. Also, totally coincidentally, I used to suffer from constant anxiety (I take something for that now)

In fact my new boss a few years ago precipitated me seeking a diagnosis, meds, and treatment. It really helped. A few years ago I got a programming job at a corporate office. It was a move across states because my ex wife had gotten a new job in the area so I took any job I could get. I was only two years out of college so I got low balled on salary. Fast forward about six months and the manager called me into a conference room end of the day on Friday. My mind was all, "fuck! What did I do now." it's end of day Friday, that's almost always never a good thing. Turns out that since they had low balled me and liked the work I did they gave me a raise to their avg salary for my position. HUGE wave of relief lol All the time. I have found a job where I don't see my boss every day. I had a job where I didn't see my boss for months at a time. It just made phone calls horrible.haha... :/ oh god i have a story like this. early one year in college i was struggling in my harder classes, and started slacking off in my best class, latin, to focus on them. the other classes‚Äô homework took me so long, i wouldn‚Äôt even do the latin readings the night before. i‚Äôd wait until i was in class, and when we were going around the room reading our translations, i‚Äôd count the people before me to figure out which line i had to read, then translate just that line really fast.

so this had been going on for about a week when i got a B on a quiz, but the professor had written ‚ÄúSee me after class‚Äù at the top. i panicked! my heart raced the whole hour. i thought he knew i wasn‚Äôt doing the homework the night before and he was going to contact the dean and get me back on academic probation. but it turned out he just wanted to ask me if my accommodations were working to my satisfaction in his class üòÇ thanks for the heart attack prof oh hells yes!!

This and the constant babble of the "mental radio", were a constant ongoing stream of conscious that was my daily reality.

I've heard it called ["catastrophizing"](https://www.google.com/search?q=catastrophizing&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b), and it is quite common across a variety of "disorders".

Since accessing treatment, I've noted that this is still prevalent, but I am now able to parse it from what was the constant "radio", and now I can shut it down. But I have to force awareness of this state of thinking and consciously "force close" the thought stream.

If I could make a suggestion, make a note, even if only to e-mail yourself that this happened. 

You got asked to do more work when you expected to get the "rolled up newspaper". 

It might later serve to remind you that you are a) getting better, and b) not all interactions with authority are going to be negative. and c) you will have a written record of this interaction, and the extra hours of work.

Sounds like you are winning **Keep up the good work!!** Aghhhh I hate ambiguous requests like this! 'I want to talk to you about something.' Well, what flipping is it? Because my brain *will* speculate until it finds out. And drive me up the wall, almost always for nothing.  Yes! So often that my boss knows to start any good meeting with ‚ÄúNothing bad, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù TODAY. over the radio "hey becca can you come see me in the office?" internally; "this is it, what did I do? will they fire me or just discipline me? I shouldn't have done __ or said ___ the other day. oh fuck." 
get there, "hey you have nice writing yeah? could you make a sign for this" OP you‚Äôre nt alone!

I have anxiety so this is amplified by the chatter in my brain. Recently I got into a strange situation with my friends, and haven‚Äôt been able to talk to them. So the past week my brain has been making up 10,000 different scenarios of how I could be screwing up. It‚Äôs not even funny. 

I haven‚Äôt resolve it yet but I‚Äôve been trying to use positive self-talk to keep it down. 

 omg this happened to me today!

"Come with me" 

... longest walk of my life ensues...

 *(points to grocery basket)* 

"Here, do these go-backs"  This isn't ADHD, it sounds like an anxiety disorder. I suppose it *could* just be chalked up to rejection sensitive dysphoria but it rarely presents itself as catastrophizing to that extent. The likelihood of having anxiety is much higher for people who have ADHD, so imo it's likely you have it judging from your post. You may want to let your psychiatrist know that this happens to you if you haven't already. (And if you have and he just said it's part of RSD, then please excuse me for being completely incorrect!) I understand your struggle!  I go one step further than is and freak out at any feedback, positive or negative. All my numbers are good but there is one thing to work on = I suck at my job and I can't do anything right and they're probably already looking for a replacement. 

The other day I got an email from our home office with my name highlighted three times in a customer contact history for someone who wrote a letter of complaint to our CEO and VPs. I thought for sure I was fired until I saw the letter he wrote and he specifically said I wasn't who he was complaining about. Still a little on edge about being under a microscope for a little bit. I had a boss once that yelled at everyone _but_ me. So I always got freaked out going into his office but he was always nice to me. But I could hear him yelling at other people in his office! It was crazy. Awful place. 

Bonus: When I left that job, actually, I had written an email to upper management telling them how awful this guy was for being so abusive, and it got sent out and he got in trouble (sweet!), but I had set it up as a task on my work computer that on accident ran every _day_. So the email went out, all the fallout happened, and then the next day it got sent again! And I had locked my computer and nobody knew my password and were afraid to shut the machine down in case it was running something important. So it just kept getting sent.  i once stole 10 dolars from my dad and that month, everytime he called me i got really anxious OMG. Yes. All the time!!! But I‚Äôm so excited to know that this is an ADHD thing, not an I‚Äôm nuts thing!! I‚Äôm thrilled!!! YES! My boss called me about something and started with "This is awkward" and my brain went right to "Holy shit! He's firing you! Over the phone!" Is this an ADHD thing or an anxiety thing  Yes I always think I've fucked up whenever *anyone* asks to talk. It's like the "we need to talk" text from a significant other applies to every single interaction in your life.  "Hey, can we have a little talk in private later?"
*Proceeds to be anxious for the rest of the day wondering what the fuck I've done wrong* I definitely experience this but I didn't think this was from my ADHD (: TIL Whenever a manager asks to see me. "What did I break?" ".....nothing, can you change your schedule?" "Oh, yeah, fine." I was mentally preparing to be fired as I went into the meeting where I was promoted.  Sounds like anxiety more than ADHD Oh gawd, for me it got so much worse after one such conversation in which my brain assumed the worst‚Ä¶and was correct. I got laid off from a temp job because there wasn‚Äôt as much work as expected, and out of the group of temps I was the least productive, [sooooo...](https://i0.wp.com/img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-01/14/22/enhanced/webdr15/anigif_enhanced-3371-1452827962-2.gif?resize=500%2C275&quality=100&ssl=1) (That was almost ten months ago, and I still don‚Äôt have a job‚Ä¶ üôÉüò≠) And did you repeat that monologue in your head several times after you walked away? Because that's what I would have done after that situation ALL THE FUCKING TIMES!!! Did you set up a reminder for Monday? I feel like that when I missed a call on my phone OH LORD THAT‚ÄòS ME! I once explained to my therapist that I get scared extremely when my boss wants to talk to me and even if she enters the room.
Not only my boss but any ‚Äûauthorized‚Äú person. I always thought it has something to do with PTSD.  My mom just did this the other day! She wanted to talk to my bf's parents (we're moving), and sent me a text in the middle of the day saying we need to have a meeting. Cue me immediately thinking of the worst possible thing, my mom going crazy, etc. My day is ruined, I barely got any work done.

She then proceeds to "go out with a coworker" when she got home. Until 11. Out waiting me to go to bed, whether intentional or not. It wasn't the first time, either; every time I would get a major bitching out for something I forgot, she wouldn't tell me right off; she would unplug the internet, then leave for a few hours while I waited at home having a panic attack until she came home. At least this time I had internet.

Then, in the morning she went to the gym before I woke up. I ended up telling  her that she can't send texts like that, because my brain has been trained to think of the worst possible thing (which, I do get that from her, because she does it. A lot.).

Oh, and in the end of rhe discussion (which we could have had the previous night) she ends up not wanting to go. I'm pretty sure my future FIL dislikes my mum now for  such a short notice meeting and then calling it off. I need to apologize to him... Oh my god I nearly had a panic attack on Thursday because my manager said an IT director was dubious of something our team released and my mgr wanted to know the ticket # of that task so he could demonstrate that it went through production review protocols (IT job). My heart felt like it stopped beating and I said ‚Äúsure, I can find the ticket‚Äù but for some reason I was REALLY worried I released it without any ticket or validation, which would get me in trouble. I found the ticket, and sent him the number, and everything was okay but it still took a very long time to lower my heart rate and settle down. I was REALLY convinced for a moment I released something under the radar and now it was going to bite me.

My Apple Watch even detected a heart rate spike over 120bpm. I feel like even people without ADHD feel like this sometimes. (When it comes to feeling like they might be in trouble at work at least...) Yes. Every. Single. Time.

The last time was the first time I actually had a "your performance needs improvement" talk.

My boss was worried about my "productivity" which is fair, there are days when I accidentally half the day on facebook and reddit. 

Our CIO recently changed and wants us running our own projects more now. That's a totally new thing for me, and it's easy to get off track. So my boss will be having weekly meetings with me to keep me on track with my projects.

I'm actually not that intimidated by it because it's something I need to work on, and I need someone to teach me how to do, because it's not something I've done before. Yes XD you should be relieveddddd  i once stole 10 dolars from my dad and that month, everytime he called me i got really anxious Spouse texts "we need to talk".

Me: well, it's been a good run. And if you have enough time, WHAT DO I SAY IF THEY SAY (...). I‚Äôm super prepared for so many situations that will probably never happen. "Cashier ringing me up" could be *ON PAYDAY*, swipe my card, takes a moment too long...."SHIT! I'M OVERDRAWN!" Cashier presses their "Total" button, purchase clears, "WHEW!" For real. And if I even see a cop, I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm going to get pulled over. I have a blushing problem that strikes when I have this panic. I feel the panic and then turn totally red - like sometimes completely tomato red on my face/neck/chest. It's VERY noticeable. 

Adderall has helped with this thankfully.

 So close to home, this hits.  Spot on!  Before I got made redundant at my previous job I was on a performance improvement plan... That was before Ritalin though. As I've only been on it for about 7 weeks I'm not sure what'll happen next. It's made a huge difference to my productivity (at both home and work), but I don't know how long it'll last like this...  It's a matter of time. Even just one is enough to make my brain jump to that conclusion every. time.  Oh that‚Äôs smart. I usually just die of internal shame, but I may try this next time.  I had to tell my husband he can't say stuff like that. Way to go!!

Any tips on your success? It's totally natural to assume someone is dead when receiving a message like that. I understand  I call my parents most days, if they ever call me, I'm all 'omg who died?'. It's verrrrryyyy rare that someone's actually dead haha.  ha! yes! Set my alarm in advance and got my boss to email me so I wouldn't forget it later! Thanks for looking out for me! 

&#x200B; hi :) Don't worry it's nothing bad... At least for my. ME TOO! I thought so too, I think everyone pretty much shits their pants and expects the worst when someone just vaguely says ‚Äùwe need to talk‚Äù or ‚Äùperson x wants to see you/talk to you‚Äù, ADHD or not. Definitely not, "normal" people don't assume the worst and run through every possible negative scenario in their head without considering the positive possibilities. It sounds to me like OP has anxiety, not just ADHD. Probably because when growing up, any time a teacher/parent/coach had to talk to us it was to reprimand us or ask why we weren't working up to our "potential".  Not to cheapen PTSD, but it almost seems like a similar response to stimuli. I second the **"keep up the good work"** and to add to keeping a record of the extra that you've done...  

I keep an folder in my email titled "Self Appraisal" I fwd emails from my boss from positive interactions, when I've gone above and beyond, when they ask me to help out, or I'll also send myself a quick email to remind myself for when it comes time to do my annual self appraisal, it's all there! I swear that's how we get screwed into crappy shifts.  We're so relieved that it's nothing bad that we aren't within the right headspace to push back on working til 8p *every Friday night* Anxiety is a common comorbidity of ADHD. As a lot are already telling you, this has probably something to do with anxiety, but it could be that your anxiety‚Äòs body is ADHD.
Since ADHD kids usually are ‚Äûdifficult‚Äú so you automatically assume you did something wrong. Lol. First date:
She says "what are your goals in life?"
Me: "We got divorced, and I am hanging myself in my apartment." Ugh. Yes. But also if something shitty *does* happen for real you also ruminate on how you could have made the interaction less shitty for hours. Hours!  Omg thiiiiiiiis. Literally every time. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And the new chip readers always make the worst noise when the transaction is completed. I can't be the only one that thinks that sounds like your card definitely just got declined. Ditto. And I really am an excellent driver. Obsessively so. I even imagine cops using me as an example and saying to someone "now THAT'S how you make a 3b point turn!"  Same! My work quality improved so much on the meds, hopefully it does last Fortunately and unfortunately it'll last as long as you keep being prescribed to a stimulant. There is no replacement  I've been on Ritalin for a few years, and the productivity will come. But if you're like me, you need someone to help you keep track of what you're supposed to be doing so you can be productive on it.
 Not only did I lose my first job within a couple months. I'd just moved across the country. I literally had _nobody_.

Eventually I got it sorted out and a few months into supervisor "promotion" (no pay incr, 60/hr weeks without o/t) I was having those talks as well.... While a dude I managed would break into her computer to change the schedules.

He came in high and sweaty as fuck one night. We both had envelopes. Mine was an ultimatum to up my numbers. His was vip hockey tickets.  It works. I just told him you have to say ‚Äúcan you come talk to me about (insert topic) I have a question or concern.‚Äù  Not say ‚Äúcan you come my desk or we need to talk.‚Äù When I explained why, he was really chill about it, like he just didn‚Äôt know that gut wrenching anxiety attack inducing fear he was causing. I would recommend talking to people about some of those things. Some times it works, sometimes people are assholes about it but people can‚Äôt change if they don‚Äôt know they need to. :)  Work hard, and then find your niche to be able to change working hard to working smart.

I've developed a new handbook and masterfile for my department, because I didn't think the old one was easy enough to use..  apparently it's mind boggling to my boss that I've created the new handbook in 10 minute spurts before my shift started Oh yeah, I got a text from my now wife then gf "hey, have you talked to your mom today? "    "you should probably call her"

Yeah, my dog, my sweet lovable(well, lovable by me anyway) dog, had died while I was away on an internship.  I mean, one time my grandmother really was dead, but I could tell from the tone of my mum's text that she really did have something she wanted to talk to me about in person. All the other times have been false alarms.  Set a second alarm abt 15 mins after the first.  If something is outa the ordinary for me sometimes I'll turn off my alarm thinking "nope, I don't have to be up this early, more sleep!"  I just found out about this yesterday. I‚Äôm really happy about it, because it helps me understand stuff.  They are often comorbid. This is exactly what I am talking about. Not only do I have negotiating points to use for my next performance review/pay increase negotiation, I have a file of GOOD THINGS about myself to reinforce my actual worth over my perceived lack.  I understand but OP's title will make anyone get anxious, ADHD or not.  Am I right? Yeah, but this is an ADHD subreddit, not an anxiety subreddit. If OP posted it here (rather than /r/anxiety) he may think that he only has ADHD and that anxiety is just a normal part of it (which is it definitely not), and he needs to tell his psychiatrist. You need to lower the bar - your goals are too high üòÇ Yes! And then recurring forever. My brain is like, "oh, having some insomnia? Let's review all memories of every shitty event EVER. Exhibit 1: preschool...." I'm on day 6 of meds and just busted head first into automating a huge chunk of my job.

Like not a basic script but a full blown tool suite that scrapes stuff from the several websites I use with Selenium, handle automated emails/templates in outlook (I proofread, I press send myself!!), store that information (ie how many times I've nagged a client vs executive action on my part),

and it's great because I'm literally getting practice in my next planned career in doing so.  My old job was so detail oriented, and I got a new boss for whom I *really* wanted to do well, so I went back on Adderall.   About 1 month into taking my meds my boss and I were meeting about a project and she looked at me and goes, your meds are really working!  

Side note, I worked in the student services office of a "special act" school and my boss was the Director of the Committee on Special Education (CSE) for our school so being honest with her about my ADHD was not as terrifying as if I were at another job.  Also very accommodating when I would try different things (ie: gerryrigging a standing desk, requesting a second computer monitor, wearing headphones while at work) yeah its a little anxiety inducing knowing it all comes down to your ability to get your meds. Well, your brain can still develop and mature, and you can learn new skills that help you cope with adhd. I‚Äôm back to school in a very intense nursing program at age 31, and I‚Äôm doing much better now than I did at my less-intense undergraduate program (age 23-27). I‚Äôm on the same dose and med now that I was on then.  I can second this. It helps to also have a therapist to make little, but incredibly helpful improvements to your usual way of doing/handling things. You are so right!! Thank you for this! That doesn't mean it's normal in any way for people with just ADHD to have those symptoms. It's normal for people with an anxiety disorder to have those symptoms, and it's common (~50%) for people with ADHD to also have an anxiety disorder. But the anxious symptoms shouldn't be attributed to ADHD, because that will make people with ADHD think it's normal for them to have anxiety symptoms as part of the ADHD and then they may be less likely to get treatment for the anxiety disorder. I'm not sure I understand the point you're trying to make by just saying they're comorbid and not adding anything else.  For real, Mr. Hangs Himself in an Apartment, and not an old abandoned warehouse like the rest of us Wow sounds great :) are you looking to switch careers? Tbh that was my thought after I found out about my ADHD 'maybe I shouldn't be in this field' That's really awesome! I'm scared about mentioning it at my current job because I feel like corporate jobs are very competitive and you don't want people to give any information that they can use against you... in a way, them not knowing makes me look better because it's like after they told me my performance sucks, I suddenly listened to their advice and got a lot better (in reality it was the meds) I hate the end of the month when I have to do the ritual "should I take 2 or 3 today"
 I started on Adderall XR and over the years I switched to Adderall amphetamine-salts then Vyvanse and then back to Adderall salts (instants). I'm on the same dose as when I was 16 (I turn 30 in two months) but it took a lot of testing and trying to figure out where I should be mentally. You obviously still need therapy (supposedly..) so I haven't gotten there yet but I just meant you really need to take your ADHD meds lol.  I wish I would have taken my therapy seriously. It's the one thing I need in my life and I no longer have insurance (BRAND NEW) until Virginia expands Medicaid in November. My point was that they often go together, so it's not like it's unrelated to people with ADHD. Thank you for clarifying both of our comments.  Sorry, please don't revoke my membership....
 I thought he was replying about the being married in the first part goal I've always wanted to get into IT, all my life, literally. And I did. I dropped out of college when I moved (I had to, unfortunately, long story.)

After about 2 years of basic entry level jobs, I trained my replacement in a law firm and was going full panic mode. I had phone interviews and in person interviews, sometimes multiple, every single lunch break when I started training this new guy. Everybody knew, yet said nothing about my 2.5 hour lunches, lol

I finally got two IT job offers. I took both jobs, and actually didn't sleep for like 48 hours. One paid more and was work from home, but they were fucking cunts. I quit that one, and I've had the same job ever since - just going into year 3.

In my spare time I've done a handful of python projects. From sorting data out, muting "only the annoying" sounds in World of Warcraft, and even a tricked out web-based PID/PWM heating and monitoring system for a snake I had. And here I am thinking, why am I not doing this for a living?

Because I can't focus. Well, I can now. And I want to do this for a living. So, I'm working on it. I can feel the effects of meds making it much more difficult to jump from one ticket I'm working on to another, or to drop everything when my office phone rings. But it's managable. When I have downtime though? Holy shit I can't get my face out of all these books I've had since 2016 yet have never been able to read. Yah, that was the first job I was so honest abt my ADHD, but again, I was working for someone that's the ally for every one of our students who had a LD. I know I've found my tribe.... I can relate, I was a bit of a techie (installing linux almost from scratch) when I was a teeteenager but there was no way I could tackle math and computer science.. always wanted to learn coding in my free time but always end up just putting it off.

Didn't know what I wanted to do for work. Picked business as the most practical option. However the field I ended up combines the biggest challenges for ADHD - details/accuracy, prioritization, being able to handle multiple ambiguous situations.

Only at my current (third) job, it dawned on me that *maaaaybe* I have attention issues. That's how I got diagnosed. So now I'm in 'what now?' mode. Despite of suddenly actually being good at my job (thx meds), I wonder if the industry is right for me. What if my meds will stop working one day? I feel like I need a contingency plan.
