I text over lengthy paragraphs in group chats and am almost childishly excited about everything My contributions to the group chat with my friends include random articles and photos (space! DND! games! oh look the 5th pretty sunset I've sent in a week!) all the time and me rambling for paragraphs suddenly out of the blue. 

I've written emotional messages about a TV show I'm watching, a nostalgic reminisce of my childhood, deep analysis of our DND campaign, so on and so forth. 

I often feel embarrassed because of my seemingly childish way of interacting when really I'm just curious about things that are novel and exciting and I want to share them. 

I don't blame anyone for not wanting to keep up with my jumps from astronomy to rpg games to forensics to art to music and more, but I do feel bad when I take over the chat wanting to share my enthusiasm but nobody really knows how to respond. Gah. 

The dichotomy of my childish excitement over things is my struggle w depressive symptoms for most of my life, and my seeming immaturity with apparently my "too mature for my age" advice giving/insight. 

(And even when people come to me for advice I'm afraid I'm rambling too much into several paragraphs when really I just care about them and want to help. I just go on tangents).  Are you my long-lost twin? I call it enthusiasm. Something that 'normal' people are often sadly lacking. Maybe that's why they try to squelch us at every turn. Children are naturally enthusiastic but we are quickly taught that this is not okay! We learn to squelch ourselves. I'm convinced that that is why enthusiasm is called 'childish', because most people are Diane out of their enthusiasm at a young age.  Retaining our natural enthusiasm is something that I appreciate about myself and other ADHD people. Because life is awesome and should be celebrated! 

I've also suffered from depression. When we have to squelch our enthusiasm I think that may contribute to depression. I'm absolutely interested in everything. I blurt things out all the time. I take 10 min to get to a point when i should have taken 1. I throw myself into every job i have because I'm so excited about all the opportunities. Then i get frustrated when no one else is as excited as me! I’m with you! I am overly enthusiastic and pretty perceptive as well so I know how that makes other people see me. I have found that it helps to celebrate that aspect of my personality and show unbridled enthusiasm for OTHER people’s interests (I can almost always find it somewhere, even if it’s just excitement over finding someone who is just so incredibly boring... like who are you? How are you alive??). My experience is that blathering on about random shit makes people not take me seriously, which can be kind of painful, but that if I have previously engaged them and supported them they are more likely to view me positively and to reciprocate. I used to be like that but I guess I was put down one too many times and now I just bottle it inside and let it die. I'm trying to get it back, just don't know how.

Keep doing you! The overexcited personality in social settings is almost deadly in text and other non-face-to-face communications. I almost exclusively feel that immediate downfall sinking into depression everytime I realize I'm the only one excited about a picture of a cat and then 40 other things not pertaining to eachother at all. It makes me feel childish and stupid. But when you meet someone on your level, it's great! Except neither of you can keep up with the others' interests because you have your own 23 tabs of web pages to excitedly look through. That's so cool, don't change. We're better than everyone else. ;) This upsets me about myself often, because I know it's the way I interact, and at the same time I often find I'm drained by others who do the same thing to me. This is me alright. But don't underestimate your positive impact. As we get older and get to see friends less and less I find my long messages about stuff are slightly appreciated much more. Because there have been times where I was either unwell , depressed or really busy and I'd be quiet on group chat for a time. Suddenly no one's talking on group chat anymore at all and people are not interacting with eachother anymore at all.

I've always seen myself as the shy one, the socially awkward one. But as I got older and examined my role in my groups of friends I have realized I appear to often play the role of the glue. And if it wasnt for my ramblings and middle man messing between groups that these people wouldn't even hang out with eachother anymore if I disappeared. And that even if they're too busy to reply, reading a long rambling message from a friend you've not seen in months is still nice for them even if it's slightly eye rolling. It'd be missed if those messages stopped appearing , and friendships would fade. 

So I feel less guilty these days if I do the odd ramble and don't even get a reply. As I know I've read the odd ramble and smiled from other friends but been too busy to reply. But it was still a nice moment to have read the thoughts of a good friend that day.  Hello, soul-sibling Cheers, felt like I could have written this. That dichotomy is spot on with me. I can have the most childish enthusiasm. Meanwhile I'm a city construction inspector fully steeped in the pessimistic reality of the human condition.

It throws people off when I go from childishly talking about how cool a piece of construction equipment is... To talking about my rejection sensitive dysphoria and the harsh realities we all face yet often don't talk about... all with the same smile on. Hey .. I lost my drivers licene recently do you have that too?
 
The bit Im finding the most difficult atm is the over talking and blurting ... where is that Time Machine when you need it?

<3 Highly relatable.

Don't want to either deal with a dozen tangents or a focused monologue on whatever I am currently obsessed about? My only solution is don't talk to me.

I get the excitement and enthusiasm. It is a manifestation of emotional dysregulation and is 100% normal for ADHDers. It can be a bit much if the people you deal with aren't used to it. I'm very similar. I find all sorts of things fascinating and assume that others will be equally fascinated, so I share. I’m such a passionate person that anytime anyone is thoroughly excited to divulge full captivating details because they are excited I am excited. Could be about ceiling tiles, just love passionate people. They often so rarely show up in my day to day life that I feel like the draw is magnetic for the few times I witness it regardless of where I am. 

 Holy shit, I am the exact same way. I’m into cars, and if someone doesn’t stop me I’ll be off on a tangent about this or that car then aerodynamics and engine tuning and... it just keeps going. 


I have however found that it makes me quite an effective programmer/ project manager. If I’m
Interested in it, I’ll dive into every aspect and faucet of the problem, from every angle. I just have to try to shut up once in a while in meetings when I have a really good solution because I’ll be off on a tanget about how I came to that solution or the root cause of the issue that’s the root cause of our issue and then people’s eyes glaze over.

I also find it can make me a bit of a natural leader, because I’ll take the reigns in a project or setting, because I have so much input or so much thought that I’ve put into things. 

Flip side is I hate being managed by people who don’t see the big picture

Annnd suddenly ^^ I’ve done it above, all while trying really hard not to 😂 So I recently found out that the right type of enthusiasm comes across as an attractive and confident personality, we just tend to over-think ourselves. 

  
Context: I know someone who is generally regarded as a fascinating friend, the kind of person you really want to get to know, and when they hang out with you its the best thing EVER. What I realized, was that there wasn't a ton of mystery to how this comes about. They are actually a rather average person who happens to speak about their interests confidently, and engages other people with their discussions. Its always super important to let other people talk and feel like they contribute, and they walk that line fairly well. The other interesting thing, was that outside of these traits, they arent anything more or less than the average person. If anything, I get some "Post-College-Burnout" vibes when you take away the aura of "Omg arent they so cool!!!!"  


What makes them put out this "Amazingly Cool and Attractive" vibe is a mixture of a few unique interest they can talk about with passion, and enough awareness of other people in the room that they bring them into the discussion. Their interest in talking about something in-depth combines with openess to include whoever is willing, and the result is a fiendish amount of charisma.   


So, to apply that to us:  


We must always be mindful of how much we talk, and if we are talking about what is relevant, and to make sure we engage other people. HOWEVER. Talking with passion is often recieved well, if you are staying with a topic that everyone can be engaged in by some degree, and if you actively include other people. People like it when we ask them things, or want favors, because it indicates trust and humans love that stuff.   


TL;DR- ADHD lets us be "Cool charismatic people", when you include others around you I do this but I try to space it out. It's not fair to everyone else to dominate the conversation. Before I share something I think 'is it relevant' 'will this take away from the conversation at hand' 'is it interesting or only to me'?

Having ADHD is great for when a conversation is slowing down. Or you need conversation starters or whatever. It's not great for being well liked in a group chat. If you can refine the waterwaterfall of information you can hydrate people without blasting them
 Yup.  Verbal diarrhea.  In person my choices are talk too much or barely at all.  But in writing I've figured out something that helps.  Before I hit send/submit I go back several times and whittle it down just as hard as I can. It's time consuming but the end result is less likely to make me feel embarrassed when I look at it later.  

Somebody's comment here mentioned "telling stories" .. that's a good description because the main attribute of my verbal diarrhea is that my enthusiasm makes me want to get the whole picture across, not just some measly summary.  Turns out people prefer summaries, go figure!  

I'm an old person and I didn't recognize my ADHD until less than a year ago.  I still have all my enthusiasm intact, along with the on and off depression.  OLD-PERSON WISDOM: even if you can't make troublesome parts of your personality go away, you'll get better and better at dealing with them.  Go easy on yourself, you have great value in your world! Space? DnD? Sunsets? Are we friends and I didn't know about it? :P I just have accepted that part as my personality. I'm just a teen but I know it will persist in to my adult years. Especially the things I'm interested in. I love comic books, cartoons, video games, superheros and other things considered to be kids' interests. It's just something I actually enjoy about my ADHD. My friends think it's hilarious,dults think it's a unique personality trait and some girls think it's adorable so I'm not complaining.  Oh god I do this all the time. I feel like it shuts down conversations, but I can’t really tell if that’s true or not. Virtually nobody can ever respond with a similar paragraph unless they have exactly the same enthusiasm for exactly the same thing. Me too. Do meds Help? I do that often. Check my one and only post. That's one I typed out impromptly. You just described be to a tee. My mom always makes fun of me for always acting like a kid or getting excited like a kid. Really, why the hell would I want to change that? I think I enjoy life more than most miserable adults I know.  Just be yourself, your true friends will accept who you are and just let you get your excitement out. I'm exactly the same as you. If it's something I'm passionate about my enthusiasm just bursts out. There's nothing wrong with you doing what you are doing. It's not immature. Love yourself and your adhd.  You having characteristics about yourself that are different from others isn't necessarily a byproduct of your ADHD. 

Be stoked and proud that you're not like everyone else, and that you find joy in things. It's cool. Do you know that this actually bothers your friends? Even if it's occasionally annoying, I bet it's charming and funny far more often :) Yeah...  I do that too.  I don't tend to go into long paragraphs, unless it is in response to someone ~~activating my trap card~~ talking about a subject I know too much about...  But dear God do I spam some random memes/links! When you are interested, you speak stories. If not interested, you cut down to a few words. 🤔 I do this too! And while I’ve been lurking on this sub for ages, this is the first post that made me feel comfortable commenting.

I have negative karma because Enthusiastic writing sounds like copy writing - which obviously doesn’t fly on reddit. Sigh. I gush when I like something.  I have the same problem. I think it goes back to executive functioning, where "typical" adults are constantly self-moderating. Our excitement about our interests is pure and unfiltered and therefore seems childlike. Unless we focus on moderating our communication, that too is unfiltered and may exceed length and bend other boundaries of social norms. I think both of these things can weird some people out and scare them away, but become characteristic quirks to the people who stay. There are a lot of other parts to us that make us worthwhile friends, and overall, our genuine, earnest nature makes us hidden gems in our society. [removed] Same. Thanks for your post. I have been feeling self-conscious about this most of my life. But it’s actually kind of cool to be like we are, I think. We have passion for things and if it can be harnessed sometimes we can do great things! And the people who really love us will love it about us.

Sometimes, though, it feels like I’m getting on my mom’s or my husband’s nerves. Because I can see the look on their faces, just trying to keep up and follow what I’m saying. I go all over the place when I’m trying to make a point or tell them about something. But they never say anything about it bothering them.

My texts to my mom look like huge blocks of texts and then I’ll get a one line response. Like “cool, that’s great!”
But she actually does the same to me and send me huge blocks of text sometimes but I send huge replies back to her.  I still do the chat thing but I got my ass beat for being too excited so I’m not happy anymore lmao A man hit me up on Plenty of Fish three years ago. I saw on his profile that he had been stationed in Guam several years prior. I had lived in Hawaii briefly around the same time he was in Guam.

So I started excitedly talking about tropical birds in our text messages, and then he got excited about it and we stayed up all night talking about birds, snakes eating centipedes, guns, video games, and other random crap.

He married my dysfunctional butt, so some people do appreciate it. I’m over enthusiastic about EVERYTHING! I know how you feel Oh my god, same here you don’t even know, I y’all so much in the group chats and I feel so bad!!!! But like I’m just excited about so many things... how are y’all not?!?! (I haven't been diagnosed but am currently figuring out the process of getting screened/possibly diagnosed)

With group chats I'm the same way, I just go on and on with a million lines and go on tangents. I'm really self-conscious about how texty I can be... Before I considered ADHD, I used to joke "ughhh i have 500 brains" (but they're not 500 smart brains)

I understand it can be overwhelming being on the receiving end so I've learned to tone it down esp with people I don't know that well. I've learned to differentiate "childlike" (positive association, curiosity, enthusiasm, openness, wonder) from "childish" (negative association, petty, flighty, capricious, pouty) and staunchly defend my right to be the former!  Yes yes yes. I suffer from depression as well, and when I do get excited about something and talk to people about that subject, I feel like I need to double check with my partner if I was being obnoxious, or seem like I was talking too much.  There were too many times where I didn't realize my enthusiasm was deemed annoying while growing up, and when I finally found out I became so self-conscious. I've only been diagnosed this past year at the age of 31, and I'm trying to really work on letting myself be me a bit more. There is nothing wrong with getting excited about things.  THIS. People are STARVING for that enthusiasm, even if they seem put off by it at first. It’s hard to tell because RSD puts a negative spin on it, but they’re only reacting that way because it’s so rare. So double down. 

It turns into a superpower when you channel that enthusiasm and curiosity towards the people you’re talking to. It’s even a rule in “How to Make Friends and Influence People”. Don’t talk about yourself, just unleash your curiosity and enthusiasm towards the other person’s life. They’ll love you for it because you made them feel valuable. Heard. And validated. Even when they haven’t learned or won’t remember a thing about you. Theyll remember how you made them feel.

Having said that, I get to the point fast when I’m texting. Nobody wants to read long texts. The problem is rooted in the same issues that causes bipolar disorder. They're sister disorders. I might be a triplet here. Same exact fucking thing going on here...

I think I found the source of my depression lately, so I’ll go ahead and share what I’ve learned to see if anyone else can relate.

Yes I’m very intelligent, but that has little to do with confidence. My confidence has always been all over the place, and I think it’s because I trust in other people too much when I should be listening to myself. I know that seems pretty self centered, but it’s the truth. Lately I have been telling myself, “Don’t let people bully you for being right and don’t play their games”. **It has been working!**

 I made friends with a girl at work after knowing her for a few years.  She admitted to me after we became friends that I was the girl in the office who was "way too excited in the morning".  Saying hello to everyone, asking what they brought for lunch (my favorite topic)... It just reminded her of how she did NOT feel that way pretty much ever, yet here I was at work exuding this excitement about pretty much nothing.

I personally like that about myself.  I like that I can get happy over the smallest things (oh, you thought I might like this type of chips so you bought me a bag and brought it for me for no reason at all?  Welcome to being my best friend!). I'm sorry people suck but don't bottle it up, that can be very dangerous. What I've found is that you have to find the right audience. You just can't word vomit all over most people but I hope you have a friend or SO you can "nerd out" with and if you don't there's plenty of people here that understand. I have been put down so much thought the years for being like this, mostly when I was young. I'm interested in so many things and can't sit still in life, so I've experienced SO much at a young age. From travel to my career... It's actually a good thing! But I've had to learn to stop talking about my experiences because sometimes I feel like people get jealous... At the same time, my impulsivity causes problems for me...

Anyway, my self esteem is really low due to 23 years of people talking smack because they can't relate to me, and I go on tangents, I feel heavily, talk too much... Same here. I've always had bad anxiety with people I don't know well. I'll be really excited, but have to stay really guarded about my excitement.  Same. Zoloft has helped immensely.  Make that 24 tabs for me!! LOL.

This is a great discussion. SO open and informative for me. this right here. "Soul-sibling" gonna use this one! Thank you. If we could find both my license and debit card I'd be set **Inner child**

In popular psychology and analytical psychology, inner child is our childlike aspect. It includes all that we learned and experienced as children, before puberty.  The inner child denotes a semi-independent entity subordinate to the waking conscious mind.

The term has manifold therapeutic applications in counseling and holistic health settings primarily.

I’ve often been told I’m “exhausting”when I get excited about stuff. I always ask my husband after we’ve been in social settings if I was acting like a crazy person because I’m pretty sure at some point I got excited about something and got “weird”. I have massive social anxiety now that I’m older and realized that I can be a lot to handle at times. Some people love it and some people simply cannot handle it. I totally do this! I love finding out about people. They are fascinating to me.  Make that quadruplets. I always catch myself about halfway when I’m showing someone something I’m pumped about, or even just talking about it. I’ve always referred to myself as “a lot” so when I’m in a situation where I don’t know a ton of people, they think I’m quiet. When I’m with my friends, I’m the energetic one. This whole thing has actually got me thinking and might explain some things I’ve been wondering about myself 😂 I'm that way on Zoloft. I love it. When the life-long battle of anxiety/depression sets in I hide in the corner and don't talk to anyone. I'm super careful about finding the right audience. For now, the best audience is my mom. With others, it'll take me more than a year before I'm comfortable to "nerd out" with them.  I hate it when I’m in a good mood, and then I’ll do something that makes me laugh (but not other people) like saying, “where did that jackass learn how to drive” because that’s something I would hear in a movie. That leads to people saying, “are you ok?” and this is where ADHD or what ever the hell I have going on kicks in and even though I’m ok, I’m annoyed that they asked in the first place, so when I say yes I’m fine, they take it as I’m not ok. 

Eventually this turns my good mood into a nervous mood and then ADHD makes me think that maybe I really am an asshole and I should be more nice to people and... **ALL OF THIS SHIT IS TERRIBLE FOR US WITH ADHD** because deep down, we really are fine, if anything we’re better than fine until someone else asserts their opinion onto me and then I accept their opinion as probably right. 

Now what I do is this...

**Them:** *With a very concerned look...*

Are you okay?

**Me:** Yes I am. *Then I try to change the subject with a smile.*

Usually this works and I go on my day, but if it doesn’t work and they bring it back up, this happens.

**Them:** Are you sure, I think...

**Me:** *Waits for them to get done talking...*

Yes, I’m fine, stop trying to change my mood.

That is what has been working for me. I’ve learned that ADHD has a little OCD in it, so even if I’m not ok, I still say I’m fine because I’m 1 minute I truly am ok. Happiness is linked to how fast you can get over something, try it out sometime, it helps! I completely understand how that is. On the flipside, you can also use the nerding out as a lithmus test to find the right people to be around. Before I knew about filtering myself my husband and friends got the full brunt of whatever random thought I had and they stuck around so I got lucky.  Beautiful!! I love it!  haha I usually explain my thought process after they ask the second time.  The responses will surprise you, and if they think you're crazy for how you put your thoughts together next time you answer "I'm fine" they won't press.   I feel like you just described half the arguments I have with my SO.   Thanks! ❤️ Yay! We can all be happy together.  I tried to do this as well, and I thought it was working for a while, and then last weekend a couple people all dropped the same bomb on me (you’re always talking about this one thing, are you happy?) and I instantly thought, “Yes mother fuckers, I have been saying I have been happy this entire time and just because I am dedicated to working on one thing at a time doesn’t mean I’m not happy, that’s the only reason I told you, and you didn’t even follow along with my thought pattern, so no hard feelings but I’m not bringing this shit up again I’ll be just fine”. 

Then I got over it and I never looked back, **keep pushing forward!** I wish there was a way for us to package these messages up so we could teach them to other people in a way where they would actually understand that by default, we’re the happiest people around, until we get in our own head, and the only reason I end up getting into my own head is because of other people. 

One time I spent a while on my own, just hiding out from my normal crowd and I went and did things where I didn’t know anyone (its been about 10 years ago) and that’s when I realized that other people drag me down. 

So, now my focus is on getting back to my alone happiness while I am around people that I know. It has been extremely difficult, but I am taking baby steps and I think it’s working!!!
