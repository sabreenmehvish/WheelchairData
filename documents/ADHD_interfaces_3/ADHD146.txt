Easily Overstimulated by Texts? Anyone else get really overwhelmed and overstimulated when you receive a lot of text messages at once? I woke up to 5 new text messages this morning. Then several of my friends were responding to texts all at once. Many of them decided to send me 5 texts in a row instead of sending their entire thought in just one text. Now I've been super anxious all day, overstimulate, and I just want to shut down everything and go into hiding. Does this happen to anyone else? For a fact. I opt out of every single group text I get included in the second I realize it's a group text. 

My phone ringing from numbers I don't recognize when I'm in public really overwhelm me too.  Absolutely!

Whenever I get texts or calls and I'm in the middle of something I usually yell outloud "wtf is calling me now" and if I'm flustered, you bet that phone is getting thrown lol Yes! I keep getting phone calls from telemarketers and scammers. Each time my phone rings, it makes me want to throw my phone. But I don't want to draw that kind of attention to myself. So I try to casually silence my phone, when I'm sure I look very frantic and anxious.
