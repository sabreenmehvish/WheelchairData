start to suspect adult ADD/ADHD while reading articles online. Seeing psychiatrist in 2 weeks. I feel guilty that I "want" to be diagnosed but I have nightmares about being denied. How do you tell the difference between lazy, unmotivated and ADHD? (Long rant with TL;DR) I know this is probably just a rant but I feel like this is the only sub I can talk about this..... So thank you if you are willing to read all this rant; I really appreciate it if you do. I know this is way too long so ***TL;DR is in the bottom***

I am currently a PhD student studying physics in U.S but not from U.S. Ever since college I start to procrastinate; I always study at the very last few days of exam, do homework at last minutes, and even do the research the last day before meeting my advisor. Things got really worse in the past 3 years since nobody is really supervising me harshly and I am working on research by myself. 

I read about adult ADHD in this March and I was shocked that many of the symptoms are describing my life. So I did some test online and some of them suggest I might have it while one or two suggest I might or might not have it. I then discover this sub and have seem some post that describe almost the same symptoms that I do have. Unfortunately the student health insurance didn't cover this and it is actually cheaper to fly home  in east Asia to see a doctor.

I also watched this talk by Dr. Thomas Brown and I am super shock a lot of things he said are similar to my experience:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RbYEuJ2Akc

Finally I made an appointment two days ago. It is in 2 weeks. 

I start to feel bad that I really hope I get diagnosed with ADHD. I feel like I am looking for excuses for my laziness,because while my work and study performance are definitely hugely affected by something, I don't have all the typical symptoms listed on all websites. I am not even sure if I am remotely close to having ADHD or just really lazy. But at the same time, I am really, really afraid the doctor would just say "you did great in school so you don't have it". 

Clearly something is wrong in me and I want to find out the problem! People usually think I am doing great but I am good at getting away with things last minutes, and I definitely feel I didn't fulfill my potential and wasted too much time. I want to do great, I know I can, but right now I can't. *I kind of really wish ADHD is the reason so I can deal with it*. If this situation continues I am very, very sure I can't graduate from my Phd. I am almost into 5th year and still at least have 3 years to go. People wouldn't believe me, but **I actually have almost ZERO progress in research in the past 2 years**.

So I guess my question is, how do you know you are affected by ADHD and not laziness or just being unmotivated? I like Physics, but I am not motivated to do the research constantly each day every hour. Also, if the psychiatrist think I don't have it, would he try to figure out other problems I might have?

I know I shouldn't post symptoms and try diagnosis here but just to share my case so hopefully you guys have some opinions...

-----------

**The things I have that are similar to ADHD:**

1. **I procrastinate until very last minutes for everything**:

* I have been warned by the TA instructor 3 or 4 semesters that if I keep grading till the last minute I might got in trouble or gets fired. I grade half of the lab reports the week before final grade should be submitted by the instructor. Before that I always know I HAVE to grade them, but when I think of all the text walls of report I just couldn't start; it feels too painful to start this boring work and even when I finally start grading I have to pause several times each lab report to browse internet. When I was in college, I remember one semester I spent a week not sleeping because it was the final week.

* If I finally start doing my research or project, once I finished the hardest part I have to rest for the rest of the day. I just don't feel like doing things. And I usually don't like to start doing research because it's difficult and I know I am going to get obstacles in there and I don't want to face it.

* I don't feel like starting doing any task I want to do, so I watch Netflix instead with guilt. I know I really should start working or I will be in big trouble, but it's always one more episode. Even before my qualifying exam, I was playing video games. And I passed it... Still, I feel very bad everytime I procrastinate but I still do so; either playing games, netflix, or just facebook/reddit. 

* I am smart enough to pass most of the obstacles. I studied in the top university, went to a decent graduate school and did OK in classes. People usually think of me as smart, but I know my potential is so far from fulfilled; I always KNEW if I work hard I can achieve a great lot more.

* Even when playing video games/netflix/internet, I switch my attention away every 10~30 minutes to different things.

* I can get very focus at very last minutes. After that I will stop working. If I work hard for 3~4 days, I will take the rest of week off, just because I "REALLY FEEL LIKE RESTING FOR A WHILE" and "Let's really do things ....but maybe take a rest first".

* When there is research/project I always start with a high standard that I wanted to do, then downgraded it because I did it last minute and do 60~80% of what I initially wanted to do. I always feel bad about it.

2. **I have to make a list to organize writing**. As of now I am making a list of what I want to type in here...and I forgot what I want to put in. I have to type out things I want to write before writing postcards to friends. I would write down key points I know I have to put in an article and stared at it, not sure how to best organize them.

3. **Can't focus on reading online article or textbook for more than 10 minutes**; there are too many temptations and I feel like I have to leave the article I am reading since it's too much to read.

4. Sometimes when I read through some words, I **understand every words I read but didn't really catch what it means** and have to go back and read it again. In some case however, I realize I actually caught it but thought I didn't. Usually worse with non-native language like English.

5. Sometimes when people talked to me (especially more severe in English), **my mind floats away/zone out if their sentences are long and need organized thoughts** and I din't catch what they were saying. I ended up having to guess what they said. People in U.S in general thinks I speak very fluent English. It happen to my native language too but not that bad.

6. **I can't wait for people to finish sentence if I have something to say**; I will cut in when they say the last few words. Sometimes I finished their sentences if I know what they are going to say. Also, if people are trying to say something or make a joke and I know what it is, I get very impatient and would look away to not listen to it.

7. **I have to make a list before packing**, otherwise I would feel unorganized and don't want to pack.

8. When I am in the left turn lane I have zero patience. I yelled in my car (I don't want to cause actual trouble so never open the window) to the car furiously if he/she starts a bit slow sometimes. **I loose temper very easily when driving**.

9. **Serious trouble sleeping since college**. I thought it was because I didn't do a good job maintaining a steady schedule, but even when I work out during daytime I still can't sleep at night a lot of times. Lately I have average of 5~6hr sleeping and have to take a nap in the afternoon (sometimes it fail too). I woke up frequently

10. I can't even start playing video games now because although I really want to play them, I knew I am going to pick up a lot of things ingame (those are huge games like Witcher 3 or Fallout 4) so I **unintentionally avoids it and just browse the internet instead**.

11. **I have at least 5~6 family members that have ADHD/ADD**, some of them diagnosed at very young age. They are all cousins or aunts/grandmother, but my twin brother has **Dysautonomia** and he is still taking Prozac (not sure if this is related).

12. **Distract by noise easily**.

13. **Forget small errands/task easily** like need to pick up stuff in store or get documents done.

14. **My Room is chaos.** It takes me a great deal to make up mind to clean room and when I do, I clean it thoroughly, but before that I never do. I travel home in January and when I got back to apartment I lay out my luggage, and since cleaning it requires organization I just never do them. The luggage and stuff inside is still laying on the floor now.

-------------------------

**Things I don't have that are listed as ADHD sympton:**

1. **I don't recall having any of this big trouble before college**. I was treat rather strict by my mom but still I don't remember having such difficulty.

2. **I have no trouble following instructions**. I like people telling me what to do because it doesn't require brainpower.

3. **I don't forget/lose things very often**. I do sometimes forget where things are and what I am doing at the kitchen, but that wasn't bad and I feel like everybody do this. **I also always put my keys/watch/wallet/phone at only several fixed locations so I rarely loose them**. I try never putting them outside these places (bedside table, pocket, one particular bag in backpack)  (*Update: And I spoke too soon... today I got the travel document signed so that I can travel with my passport, put in my pocket, get dinner and on the way home it fell out and sit on the parking space for 5 hours and I didn't even realize I didn't take out the document and put it back. I almost couldn't find it and was almost crazy*)

4. **I don't have really bad mood swing**. I tend to consider things at the worst case scenario and worry way too much, but I don't swing mood.

5. **When I am required to sit in a meeting, I can sit in a meeting**. I get anxious if the meeting is boring and people are wasting time, but I wouldn't lose control and stand up. If leaving meeting gets me in trouble I wouldn't do that at all.

6. **I don't make much careless mistake with work**, because I am doing it slowly.

7. **I don't always feel "restless"**. I do have to spin a pen or something when I do work. I don't know what it feels like to not being able to relax so not sure if I am like that.

8. **I rarely feel like I am driven by a motor** or on the go and have to do things. More likely I feel like I am lazy and lie on my chair in front of my computer, feeling like not doing things but feeling bored at the same time.

9. **I don't talk that much**, and if people are busy I wouldn't interrupt them.

10. **I sometimes can get really concentrate when doing things I like**.

11. **I don't often forget appointments if they are important**; rather, I think about it all day anxiously (you need to do xxx at xx:xx!!!).

------------

I talked to my aunt and cousin which have ADD/ADHD and they even said "but brian, why do you want ADD?" then my cousin said "I was diagnosed but I say screw them I don't want it so I control myself when I am in college so you can probably do it too". But I am way past college. I do can control it in college, but GOD graduate school is a complete different level. I even have a master degree and has a published paper already, and yet I think it is getting terrible. People wouldn't believe me and I really doubt if I am making excuse or really has problem.

Thank you for reading all this; I really want to say it to somewhere and you guys are the nicest people I know now. I really need this place to get things off my chest. I can't talk to people around me.

-------------

**TL;DR:** *(I know this is suppose to be 1-liner..)*

1. Doing well enough in school, has bachelor/master degree and now in PhD program, still thinks I might have ADHD. Never noticed symptom before college. Hugely influenced by something past few years; has almost zero progress in past 2~3 years, literally.

2. Don't have some symptoms listed on self-tests.

3. Really doubt if I am lazy/unmotivated or is affected by ADHD.

4. Really want to get diagnosed even though feeling guilty about this. If I really have it then I NEED to know so that it could explain everything and I can possibly deal with it

5. Flying home for doctor in two weeks, very afraid he wouldn't believe me. (or afraid I am actually just using this as excuses)

6. Not sure what to do if denied. Do Psychiatrist refer you to other problems if they think you don't have ADHD? The irony of writing that wall of text on /r/ADHD. I quickly skimmed, but I will tell you this, if you believe you have it, then you probably do. As much as I wanted to have a name for this thing I had, I was more afraid of getting medicated on stimulants that I didn't need. In the end, I was right (I do have ADHD).

Go meet with a professional, share with them your concern of confirmation bias, however, if you feel you have a problem there is nothing wrong with seeking help. In describing yourself, you've also very nearly described me - including the feelings of guilt wanting to have ADD.  I'm currently working on my masters in biology, and I want to move on to a PhD.  
I now take medication, and it does help.  It's much easier to do the menial tasks like laundry and being more consistent in picking up after myself at home, instead of doing huge cleanups every couple weeks and then letting my apartment recede into chaos before doing another huge binge clean.  

I can also relate to your experiences sitting in meetings.  Maybe that's the perfection piece fighting back against the ADD?  I want people to like me! 

Thank you for sharing your experience!  I made a reddit account just so I could comment.  I'd comment more, but it would mostly be just me saying "yes, that too!"

Good luck In my opinion, focusing on things you don't enjoy or don't want to do becomes harder with age, humans spend their whole lives working so it is easy to just forget about responsibility and do whatever you want. In a philosophical sense, we already do what we want to but that complicates things. You could have ADD/ADHD but don't be afraid if you don't, everybody is lazy and will procrastinate to a degree and there is nothing wrong with that. If you don't let laziness and procrastination define you then all is as it should be. Good luck with the doctor m80. ...Print this and give it to your doctor. 

...Don't be disappointed if you aren't immediately diagnosed, be disappointed if they don't refer you to someone else. You shouldn't feel guilty for seeking help or information. If you believe that you have an impairment, then no one could fault you for trying to achieve your optimal abilities. 

...It may not be adhd, it may be something else, you're a tenacious PhD student in PHYSICS, get your answers. Also, if you're not from the U.S. make sure you check that you can bring your medication before visiting home. ADHD meds are illegal in a lot of countries. A few notes: first, you shouldn't feel guilty about wanting to get a diagnosis. It's not that you want to have ADHD, it's that you're looking for a way to understand and deal with your struggles. Imagine you had really bad leg pain and you thought it was broken. You're going to the doctor to have it checked out, and your friend says "but Brian, why do you *want* to have a broken leg?". You don't want a broken leg, you want relief for your pain.

Also on the laziness, laziness is not wanting to put in the effort to do things and not caring. When you desperately want to do things and they're still not getting done, it's not laziness. 

The thing that will likely give the psychiatrist pause is that you mention that you didn't seem to have these problem when you were younger. While there some minor research recently on adult onset ADHD, one of the main diagnostic criteria for ADHD is that symptoms have been around since you were a child. It tends to lead them towards considering depression (or disthymia, a milder but chronic form of depression), anxiety, or bipolar disorder, all of which can be adult onset and share some symptoms with ADHD. That or physical causes. 

The thing I actually catch on in your post is that you mention your issues sleeping, and the timeframe roughly coincides. Sleep disorder symptoms have **major** overlap with ADHD. 
 Even if you dont have adhd, is there anything else you can do to survive? You sound creative with all these methods of exec functioning to help your issues prior to a diagnosis which is great! How quickly are you to fidget to focus? Do you fidget during netflix? I fidget in literally everything to focus, it's a great indicator amongst my family members and some friends as well. How often so you engage yourself through multimodial learning? As in, reading and speaking about things to help focus your attention and relate information? Its something alot of adhd ppl do. If you want to get a better idea of yourself as a child where adhd symptoms tend to show, check out your report cards from kindergarten and grade 1 I'm a fellow PhD student with the same concern. My appointment is in 1.5 weeks and I'm really worried my recent grades will make them think it's unlikely. I'm with you on grading assignments - it is the most boring thing I've ever done! I can also relate to grad school being completely different to undergrad. I got away with doing everything at the last minute and still getting the highest exit mark...but without due dates, close supervision, and grades, I'm feeling lost in the PhD.

My current plan is to go in with a big list of concrete examples from my life. I've been keeping a running list of all the examples of inattention/hyperactivity from the last while...it's already four pages :/ I think that'll be better than just talking about abstract symptoms. Not sure if it'll help but that's my advice! Good luck! I empathize with your wanting clarity on a diagnoses. Being diagnosed with a psychological 'label' means you'll have a perfect opportunity to solicit the necessary options for ameliorating a possible psychological condition - to the effect of improving your quality of life and increasing your ability for productivity, and thriving in your academic, social and hobbyist pursuits. The assurance that comes with a diagnoses is truly liberating - finally you can jettison your notions of laziness or apathy for a more defined syndrome. A diagnoses gives you impetus to research your condition to find coping mechanisms and recommendations for adjusting. Sometimes, I even search for successfully famous people that share a similar condition to mine and feel a distant kinship - a bit narcissistic, I know but it has me feel somewhat normal by comparison. Anyway, I hope that soon you'll be able to get clarity on your symptoms. LOL, textbook "compensated adult." You just went through the damn checklist: "but what if I CAN sit still? But what if I hyperfocus on something so I don't forget it? But what if I worked out that if I put my stuff in the same place I won't lose it?" So yeah. If your doc is competent, you'll be fine.

Source: also in PhD program, got diagnosed during my second MA degree, reading this was like reading my own doubts. I made such huge lists to convince myself, the doctor and possibly others if they asked,too. Got diagnosed a year ago and hat pretty much the same Shit going on. Only discovered ADHD so late because of my pretty high IQ, which can makr boring things even much worse. 
As has been said. So much as you now think you have ADHD and see how this disorder pretty much explains everything suddenly... I say you have it. Plus ive seen some people, including me who felt the same; "wanting" to be right and so wanting the diagnose to be certain. Its normal. You maybe not normal but you are in good companionship! Hope everything works out good for you :) ADHD is a spectrum disorder, it has 3 variants, we all have different brains, have lived different lives and learned different coping mechanisms. It's normal that not everyone has the same symptoms.

Alike disorders are depression, anxiety, borderline, and bipolar depression - you can read about them and see the differences to best prepare for the visit. (For instance, I know I'm not bipolar, because my mood swings are correlated to events in my life, whereas in bipolar depression, they happen out of nowhere.) Sorry, TL;DR Thanks! I am scheduled with a doctor specialized in Adult ADHD so he will definitely know more than I do. My one cousin said he hated the medicine because "it makes him dumb" so I don't want to use medicine that doesn't suit me either

*Edit: those were the actual words one of my aunt that has ADHD told me how my cousin describes it Yes, I totally forgot to mention my room is a chaos; I still have the luggage from half year ago not organized and clean up! Also, thank you for the reply. Good to know people share similar experience. Do you mind I ask if you have it diagnosed?

As for the thought of "wanting people to like me", that's me everyday. I am in constant worry that people don't like me for any possible reason and try to please people too much even when I feel it being very tiring.  thanks. I will ask the doctor about the medicine if I do get diagnosed. I only stay at home for 2 weeks so if it can't be done I would have to do it back in the state thank you.

The sleeping issue is ambiguous because I kind of mess around with sleeping schedule a lot especially in college, by studying late or video games. Sometimes when I tried to have regular schedule though it still wouldn't work. Nowadays (I'm almost 30 now) it's more like I can't go to sleep easily, and I often wake up after 5~6 hours of sleep, before my alarm! I gets really tired but I wake up nevertheless. haha, I am not entirely sure what fidget means actually but I tend to do this kind of pen spin when I study:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDayvRnEPrI

...And I will try to find a pen if I don't have one while studying. I don't really do that while watching Netflix, just layed back and thinking how much things I should be doing (I shake legs sometimes though).

Not sure what multimodial learning is either, but I speak to myself often in my brain and sometimes I speak out a few words while studying or doing research if no one is around. If I get anxious with texts I might speak them out a few times sometimes. Thank you. I did started a note on Onenote so that I could pull that out anywhere on my phone. The list I had right now is pretty messy and unorganized though, so I probably have to re-write it at some point (lol, procrastinating on this)

I am just anxious because although I have a bunch of concrete examples, some doesn't seems 100% like ADHD and it could always be countered by "others do this too", and I am not as bad as a lot of people I saw online (ex: forgot things very often). I think the most obvious thing I have is lack of motivation which according to Dr. Thomas IS what ADHD is about, but I doubt people will tell you to pursue other stuff instead. 

Anyway, good luck to you too! And yes grading is the worst thank you! thanks! do you mean compensated adult by that I try to do something to counter something?

I hope your help with ADHD has help your program. It is a tough road no matter what condition one has Thank you! would normally the doctors help one to find out if depression/anxiety is present? I don't think I am bipolar either cause I usually get sad when there is a concrete reason. But I am not familiar with depression and anxiety; I don't feel like I am like that either but I do notice I interact with people differently than what I guess other people do, for example I overthink things way too much and get huge reaction from others actions > "it makes him dumb"

If it means what I think it means, he probably articulated it badly. But sometimes Ritalin (if that's what he was taking) can make you feel blurry and weird, definitely not dumb though. Besides, there are many medications that can help with it, and not everyone gets the same side effects. Yes, I had it diagnosed about 2 years ago!  

Your experience sounds very, very similar to mine.  I've always tried to please people, but I've been more blunt lately and it honestly feels like such a relief.  It's not that I don't care at all, but I'm better at not trying to spend time making people happy when I don't need to/want to/enjoy being around them, anyway. You're welcome. I mean that you have largely found workarounds and ways to keep up anyway, despite your condition - it just takes a fuckton of effort and is hard.

The higher intelligence you have, the longer it takes to get diagnosed - this is pretty typical for ADHD, as my doctors tell me.

And thanks! And good luck to you as well!

Edit: accidental sending too early. Yes, it's first and foremost their job.

I just can't remember enough during one visit to make a good assessment of myself, and it's also hard to objectively assess one's varying mood. Personally, I'm on a high during every visit, because we're making things better, so cool! So I hugely recommend preparing and writing down one's symptoms, and then the doctor should gives a diagnosis based on them.

Also, depending on the country, doctors may know little about ADHD, let alone how it looks like combined with depression (which can curb hyperactivity, for example). I had to push hard. I had good grades in school, so no ADHD, and wasn't that depressed, so dysthymia it was.

 yes, he is taking Ritalin. He was diagnosis around 5 I think. He didn't do well in high school and college at all, but we are not close so I don't know the detail Wow, this is the first time I heard this "dysthymia " and it looks a bit similar to me too, especially the part about low self-esteem, problem sleeping, and social thing. I should probably ask the doctor about this too If you are diagnosed then you will probably start there, I did. It made me sick to my stomach. The thing is, you don't need to keep taking anything that doesn't feel right. Just don't settle. 

I tried quite a few different meds before finding what worked. With these drugs, the effects are pretty immediate. If even after the first or second day it isn't working or makes you feel bad, voice your concerns. If your doc asks you to keep it up for a week, and its still no good, then make a change.
