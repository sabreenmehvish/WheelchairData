Life Pro Tip: have whatever digital text you're reading be read outloud by your device while you read it If you listen only, you'll just space out, let's be real

-For kindle, within the past couple months there was an update that now allows all books to have text-to-speech. It will automatically turn the pages for you as it reads them to you. You can have it be slow or fast.

-For chrome, there is an extension called SpeakIt! where you can highlight any text, and it will read it. It can also do varying speeds.

If you're reading a word document or pdf, copy-paste the text, compose a new email in your browser, paste the text in the email, then highlight the text there and SpeakIt! can read it to you.

There's other text-to-speech chrome extensions and probably extensions for other browsers, SpeakIt! is just the one I happen to know

Good luck, humans There's also beeline it, where it changes the text to different varied colours to make it easy to read.

Mac users can highlight online paragraphs and get it to read to them. WAITWUT. How do you do the thing on Kindle? Go to the menu in the top right and hit "text-to-speech". If that option isn't there then you don't have the new update yet
