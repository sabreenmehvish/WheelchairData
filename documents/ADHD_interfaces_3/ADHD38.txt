Reading Naked Lunch was how reading any other book felt like. If you haven't read it, it's basically a cut and paste narrative where the flow of the story is derailed about every few paragraphs. I found an odd comfort in getting to the next page without any recollection of what preceded.  Burroughs wrote it in a way where the reader can open the text at random and read a section without being confused. And that's just about the most ADHD thing I've ever heard Yeah - can't do it.

Would drive me crazy; I seek structure, even structure in story. yes. try bob dylan's Tarantula. although it's not quite as literally cut-and-paste as Naked Lunch, it's very obviously free associative and all over the place like it. it's got that thing where you can place your finger on a random line and it can be consumed alone and then seem like it has very little relation to the next or previous line.. until you read like one line 5 pages past that ties it all together. i keep it with me on days when my brain can't find structure in anything. sounds counterproductive to use this book as a source of comfort but knowing that there isn't supposed to be a clear message in all of it that i'm possibly missing because of my ADHD and that i just don't have to give a fuck about absorbing it in a specific way just feels great That book made me aware of the fact that I don't usually read books in order. Opening to a random page, then going back and trying to figure out what I'd missed was basically how I read everything.

That revelation, however, did not make it any easier to finish. Kept feeling like I must have zoned out and missed something, going back and re-reading, and realizing I read it all. I must have read every passage three times trying to figure out where I lost my place. 

Anyway if you haven't read Junky yet, it's also great.  Try reading *[House](https://www.amazon.com/House-Leaves-Mark-Z-Danielewski/dp/0375703764/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496850723&sr=8-1&keywords=house+of+leaves) of Leaves*. Lots of jumping around.^1 Lots of format screw: sidways or upside-down text, text in geometric shapes, one word per page, etc. Lots of hidden clues and easter eggs. Plus it's a pretty bizarre, surreal, suspenseful story in itself. It made for a much more dynamic reading experience.

^1 Half the story is told in footnotes.^2

^2 And there are footnotes to footnotes to footnotes. The book which finally put me off opiates for good.  Try William Gibson.He has ADD.
Brilliant books. He & Brion Gyson were into [cut-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique). Tried to use it for an essay grade, prof not having any of it, though he was familiar. 
Plus, read over years, James Joyce's ['Finnegans Wake'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake) style lends itself to 'interrupted' reading. Cheers! I actually read that although Junky embraced the cut-up style, Naked Lunch was compiled and edited by Ginsberg and (Kerouac? or another contemporary). The narrative, or that-there-of is Ginsberg's creation based on writings sent to him by Burroughs over a period of time. 

(Can anyone verify? I don't think I dreamed this)

(Note:
For many years I thought I had imagined the acoustic version of Layla until I heard it on the school bus.) I can absolutely relate, can't deal with "postmodern" because constantly worry if I am missing the structure that was not  even there to begin with ##Cut-up technique
The cut-up technique (or découpé in French) is an aleatory literary technique in which a text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs, and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

##Finnegans Wake
Finnegans Wake is a work of avant-garde comic fiction by Irish writer James Joyce. It is significant for its experimental style and reputation as one of the most difficult works of fiction in the English language. Written in Paris over a period of seventeen years and published in 1939, two years before the author's death, Finnegans Wake was Joyce's final work. The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, which blends standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words to unique effect.
