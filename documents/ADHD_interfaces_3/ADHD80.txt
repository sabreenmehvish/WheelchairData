how to get the most out of reading really dry uninteresting text So I am taking a class where there is a lot of reading to do, like 150 to 200 pages every other day. All the literature my professor assigns is pretty dry very extensive and jumps between ideas often. I keep spacing out or just don't catch much so what do you do to try and get the most out of what you read? I force my self to highlight the important bits, just to make sure I'm paying attention.
