I can play video game at high level, can barely read a paragraph of a text book took me only a few months to go from amateur to  gladiator on WOW(world of warcraft) (top .5% arena players), but everyday I read my textbook it just blows my mind that it never gets easier. "What did I even just read?" Depending on the book, I can go through paragraphs, pages and pages, and couldn't tell you what I read. 

Over the last few months I've been doing everything under the sun, (besides medication), pomodoro, reading aloud, listening to different types of music while I study, not listening to anything, note taking, reciting, different work places, schedule.  I eat a high veggie diet, in good shape and I've exercised consistently for 8 years. The only thing that seemed to garner noticeable results was nofap, but it's difficult to keep up.  I have a buddy who can't hold down a job because he has adhd and can't bring himself to get treatment as he's already 30 and is so demoralized he doesn't care anymore about life.

I wish I could get him to seek treatment but I know what that stubborn pride feels like.  Admitting weakness it hard

He just plays WoW all day. I'm also a ex WoW addict, I played so much I was able to learn the entire English language (am French Canadian) in only a couple years and like you I played at a high level. It seems pretty common for people with AD(H)D to perform above average in the few things that stimulates them, I dropped out of school because of that game and It was only recently when I tried to go back to school and I couldn't read and memorize a single paragraph that I truly learned what ADHD was, I'm diagnosed now and ever since I've been on meds school has seriously been a breeze for me. It really is mind blowing. thanks for sharing. I gave up my wow addiction over a year ago, I want to feel addiction for life and learning.  interesting, thanks for sharing.
