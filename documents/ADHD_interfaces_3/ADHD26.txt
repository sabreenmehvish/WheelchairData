Recommendation for reading focus. I'm in university. This my first semester back with adhd treatment. Doing well so far. But I'm having trouble with my reading pace. I kept up pretty well at the beginning I even started the semester having read the first few chapters of each book. Now though it seems I can't sit and focus on the material. Any tips on getting through reading? audiobooks (put them on a faster speed so it doesn't go too slow), while reading along!
& generally reading out loud to yourself as well.
keep reminding yourself to focus, try to be really aware when you start to drift off and stop yourself. 
also, force yourself to read a little bit at a time ~every day, dont sit up and cram it all in one night.
 Also, with math and science texts, audio/text-to-speech isn't really an option because equations can't really be read out loud (at least not in a way that makes much sense just by listening). In that case, I've found it helps to either

1. Copy down the equation and the surrounding text that introduces, describes, and derives the equation. 

2. Read the equation out loud as if you're teaching it to someone else. Make sure to talk out the definition and significance of every variable, operation, and symbol. Also, talk through every operation of every step of a derivation/solution.

3. Read in a physically active way. Walk around while reading out loud. Stand up and pretend you're reading it to a group/class. Write the equations and such on a white/black board.

This can also apply to reading code in a CS text.

This is coming from having done grad school in both math and physics. It's almost impossible for me to comprehend a dense, mathematical text just by sitting and reading, so I had to invent ways to get through it. Thank you both for the suggestions. For my business law I often read and takes pretty detailed notes while I progress but it's proven to be both labour intensive and time consuming. Though it does help with retention.
