Even on my medication I have trouble focusing on large text. I love reading. I used to read all the fucking time. Me and my dad may bash heads over politics frequently but he always gave my cool history and science books. I used to get in trouble for *reading* so damn much in class.

Now I'm 20 and I can't focus on reading at all. I can't get through large posts on Reddit. I've been meaning to finish a book but I just can't find the time. Everytime I try to read anything really big my eyes just glaze over. I'm getting so fucking sick of it. 

Not only that, because of this I'm a writer without the conviction and temperance to read his own work. I have immense trouble proofreading when I'm done typing.

And when I do focus on reading long text I have trouble keeping all of it in my head. I have to go back and re-read paragraphs just to remember what happened in them. 

It feels like it's getting *worse* too. Honestly, *all* of my symptoms are getting much worse and it's starting to really worry me. Ive always had this to a certain extent, but the last couple of weeks have been insane. Usually if I find something boring i have a hard time finishing it, but now even the shit I would normally love to read is becoming a hassle. I just get this like uneasy feeling in my body, like a dog thats waiting to be released from his leash to run outside. Thats how I feel while reading, its like it takes so much to focus on this piece of text. I think I experienced the same thing. It wasn't until University that i realised that i was a below average speed reader. 

My theory is that this is a result of developing habits to compensate for ADHD. As the amount I had to read increased and the amount of time I had to read it decreased, the habit of trying to scan for the most relevant parts of the text became more pronounced. This can be pretty handy if you're looking at a textbook, which are designed to teach you things as slowly and lucratively as possible or projection slides. But when the intention is to read everything it's hard to overcome this and it really slows me down.

Also, I think I try to learn as much as possible from any small thing that makes sense to me. So, if I read an interesting fact my mind will go on a tangent and think about what that means and the implications of that fact being true. By the time this train of thought is done, I'll realise that I've just been staring at a page for fifteen minutes idly. 

My e-reader helps me with the scanning because you can really control the amount of text on a page. Besides that, using something to physically track where you're reading helps (ie. use your finger to track along or a straight-edge to keep your eyes on the line you're reading). For retaining information, I  try to make mental or physical notes after each paragraph. It seems counter-intuitive, but you really have to take your time, or else you'll end up spend your time reading, not actually reading and go much slower.

Good luck. Reading's great. **Highlighters & pens- mark it up!** As you're reading, circle/highlight/underline (whatever way you feel like doing it) the key words, main ideas, most interesting points... find the thing that stands out in each paragraph. If you get stuck somewhere and there's nothing you can find worth highlighting, move on to the next paragraph. It might feel like extra annoying work at first, but it becomes natural and easy really quick.

**"active reading"** (as it's called) is a really good way to keep yourself engaged when your reading, and also the process of doing it helps you retain the information and the general flow/structure of the text much better. Yes, it takes longer, but it's also much easier than trying to force your brain into submission line by line. There's also something really satisfying about *owning* what you're reading and seeing the evidence of your progress as your going. 

I'm halfway through grad school, and am constantly buried under mountains of horribly dull articles and textbooks, and my highlighters and pens have become my best friends. As far as novels/fun reading, I don't usually need to mark it up paragraph by paragraph to stay engaged, but keeping a pen nearby in case I get stuck or find something particularly interesting still helps. 

**Tl;dr: active reading; highlighters & pens; mark it up as you read. Sounds like a lot of work, but trust me it makes reading easier** I'm also around your age, and have been dealing with this for much longer. It feels as if I don't read with purpose and interest - as if I'm losing interest rapidly, if there ever was any to begin with. I remember really enjoying reading as a kid, but I never really had many moments where I got closely involved in reading for pleasure unless it was something spontaneously catching my eye (typically online) - like a topic I actually had thought about recently enough to summon my interest in it.

It's bizarre but it's hard for me to be deeply interested enough to think clearly about something unless It was on my mind *very* recently. http://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/

Check this out. I was diagnosed with it last year and it makes a lot of sense, as I have the same difficulties with reading.  That is exactly how I feel! It truly sucks. I just dont have any medication. Still a self-prescribed ADHD patient here haha. Going to the doctor this month. Hope if I get meds this gets solved, because I feel like im going crazy.
