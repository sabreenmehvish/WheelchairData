Surprisingly decent write-up on 21 of the realities of ADHD on Buzzfeed. I listed them out here in plain text so you don't get sucked into Buzzfeed! [LONG] **1. First of all, ADHD is a legitimate neurobehavioral disorder — it's not just feeling distracted and disorganized.**

>"ADHD is a bonafide neurological disorder recognized by the DSM and countless major institutions, and backed up with years of research," says Kevin Murphy, Ph.D, President of the Adult ADHD Clinic of Central Massachusetts. Many people still struggle and blame themselves for what they think is a defect in character, he says, when in reality it's a very treatable disorder.

**2. The brain of someone with ADHD is literally different.**

>The frontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for executive functioning, is actually wired differently in individuals with ADHD. "There is under-activity due to decreased blood flow, decreased glucose metabolism (a measure of brain activity), and lower levels of neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine," says Murphy. He describes it as having a frontal cortex that, at baseline, is running on fumes instead of gasoline.

**3. Most of the symptoms are caused by an impairment in your brain's executive functioning, which is basically the control center.**

>We so often talk about ADHD in terms of symptoms such as lack of focus, but symptoms aren't an explanation for the disorder itself. "We must understand ADHD as a disorder of self-regulation and self-control," says Russell Barkley, Ph.D., ADHD expert and Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Medical University of South Carolina. All these things are driven by the brain's executive functioning, which includes six key areas: self-awareness, inhibition, working memory (verbal and nonverbal), self-motivation, emotional control, and effective planning or problem solving.

**4. There are actually three different types of ADHD.**

>And each type is characterized by the kinds of symptoms someone presents with. There's the predominantly inattentive presentation, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, and the combined presentation. And because symptoms can change, a person's presentation of ADHD can also change over time.

**5. Actually being diagnosed with ADHD can be a long and frustrating process.**

>When someone goes to a doctor or therapist presenting with symptoms of ADHD, the clinician looks at so much more than just how they describe their struggles. They also consider things like when the symptoms started, changes in school performance or behavior, and impact on their family and social life. "Someone with ADHD will have clear footprints in the sand," Murphy says. But people can also have ADHD-like symptoms from depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and other situational stressors, Murphy says. Psychiatrists will try to rule out every other possible explanation for the symptoms to ensure that they have a reliable diagnosis.

**6. People with ADHD don't have a lack of knowledge, they just have trouble putting that knowledge into practice.**

>The part of the brain which is under-active in ADHD individuals, the frontal cortex, isn't responsible for understanding and retaining knowledge. "Knowledge is in the back part of the brain, it's the part that puts knowledge into practice which is impaired," says Barkley. People with ADHD can retain knowledge just like anyone else, it's just difficult to use it in an effective and timely manner. So people with ADHD often have trouble speaking or writing on the spot and take to creative things. "ADHD is not a disorder of not knowing what to do, it is a disorder of not doing what you know," says Barkley.

**7. So performance-based things like school and work are especially tough.**

>"Oftentimes people with ADHD can score very high on intelligence tests, but they have poor grades in school because it's very standardized and performance-based," Murphy says. Problems at school are typically a reflection of symptoms — trouble focusing, interrupting, forgetting books or papers at home, managing time poorly — and not a sign of low intelligence.

**8. But ADHD can affect all parts of your life, not just school or work.**

>The DSM-5 definition requires that at least two areas of one's life are impaired and disrupted by symptoms, says Murphy. So ADHD might affect you at school, but it could also affect your social life, athletic abilities, career, finances, sexual activities, parenting, etc. "It's not failing organic chemistry," says Murphy. "ADHD has an unmistakable effect in functioning that causes major life disruptions."

**9. Focusing on just one thing can be tough, since people with ADHD are hypersensitive to their surroundings.**

>People with ADHD often see and hear everything around them, noticing things that most people are able to completely tune out, Murphy says. It can be helpful at times (especially in some creative fields), but at other times these distractions can easily becoming overwhelming.

**10. But you might also hyperfocus, which makes it super hard to switch to a new task.**

>"Hyperfocus" is kind of a misnomer, Murphy says, but it basically means that people with ADHD can become so deeply focused that they can't let go and stop when they're supposed to switch tasks. (Often known as "being in your own little world.") This can be great if you need to finish a project or paper, but not as practical when you have multiple things to work on. "It's cleaning the entire house instead of doing an hour of taxes," Barkley says. This is where reminders and time management strategies can be hugely effective.

**11. Impulse control can be a major issue.**

>When you have ADHD, you know what you're supposed to do but your mind may automatically move you in a direction that's immediately satisfying, says Dr. David Goodman, Assistant Professor at John Hopkins and director of Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Center of Maryland. What comes next is usually rationalizing the behavior with a long, seemingly legit explanation, but it's really because you maybe lacked the tools to have a more thoughtful, controlled approach from the start. "If you're the cart and the horse is your ADHD, you need to hold the reigns at all times or the horse will go wherever it wants and you'll end up needing to explain why," Goodman says.

**12. But it's not just a lack of willpower that's keeping you from focusing.**

>"Whatever is causing people to lose focus is much bigger than their ability to control it — that's exactly what makes ADHD a disorder," Murphy says. It's the I-would-if-I-could-but-I-can't feeling. And the endless cycle of trying and failing to focus can be very demoralizing if you don't understand that the underlying cause is a brain impairment, out of your control.

**13. Working memory is a huge problem, so people with ADHD often forget what they're doing.**

>"Working memory is like the mind's recorder or sketchpad — it holds all the recent information in your mind driving you to complete certain tasks," Barkley says. It reminds you what you're doing, what your is goal at the time, and which steps you will take to get there. When working memory is impaired, its easy to get overwhelmed with thoughts, and for your behavior to get distracted by what's around you. "People with ADHD have a lot of trouble remembering what they're doing at any given moment, not what they did," says Murphy — which is why they often go into a room and forget why they went there.

**14. Having no concept of time is also a very real struggle.**

> According to the experts, people with ADHD are fundamentally bad at understanding the passage of time. They easily lose track of time, underestimate how long stuff will take, or try to do just one more thing before they get out of the door. They call this "time blindness," and it can also be due to problems with willpower. "It's hugely difficult to simply be aware of time and cut things off when you need to go," Murphy says. So it's helpful for individuals with ADHD to create cues in their environment to keep time top of mind — whether that's having fifty alarms before you get out the door or keeping a sand timer on your desk.

**15. Medication helps, but it isn't a magic pill.**

>Medication treats the underlying brain biology by increasing blood flow to the frontal cortex, which is under-active, Murphy says. But treating ADHD is not as simple as taking your pills — especially when pills only normalize your brain temporarily. The most effective long-term treatment, Murphy says, is typically a combination of medication, behavior modifications, therapy, and environmental changes that target performance — which, yes, is a lot of hard work, but often makes a world of difference.

**16. People with ADHD usually need a lot of reminders to stay focused, manage time, and plan effectively.**

>"When you fully understand the nature of the disorder, you develop strategies to aggressively manage it," says Murphy. Everyone has their own system to control their symptoms, and it means the world when other people respect that, no matter how weird or simple the system seems... like writing to-do lists all over your hands or having a million sticky notes on your computer monitor.

**17. And finding the right environment and stimulation that helps you be more efficient is a huge deal.**

>People with ADHD often have "situational variability of symptoms," Murphy says, which means certain circumstances can make focusing much more problematic, while others can make it so much easier. Maybe you realize that listening to classical music, chewing gum, or having total silence are your safe zones. Finding the environment that works for you is crucial, and it can vary depending on the person and their specific symptoms.

**18. It may seem like people with ADHD are procrastinators, but it's really that they have trouble plotting out the steps to reach a goal.**

>Achieving a goal in the future that requires extra steps ahead of time is very difficult. "For people with ADHD, a paper due in three months is not a real thing — it's now or not now," says Murphy. It's much harder for the brain to create those incremental steps along the way, and the person may underestimate how long work will take them so they end up doing it all last minute.

**19. It's also very difficult to control your emotions, good and bad.**

>Because ADHD is largely a disorder of self control, it's very difficult for people to manage strong emotions that get elicited by things around them. It's not just negative emotions like anger or sadness, but also love, happiness, excitement. So even one sad news headline or the thought of a new relationship can completely derail someone's day.

**20. Having ADHD often comes with feelings of fear and self-doubt.**

>Even when someone with ADHD does something well, they may fear being able to do it consistently. They are afraid of being held to the standard of their best performance, says Murphy, because anything less might be attributed to laziness and cause them to feel demoralized. So people often shy away from challenging tasks or new jobs and stay with what is safe and predictable. The idea of finding a way to manage their symptoms in a new environment and failing is so daunting that it may deter them from seeking out something they really want to do.

**21. ADHD is a life-long disorder, but it's completely possible to get under control.**

>Roughly 5% of children in this country have ADHD, and Murphy says about 80% of those will continue to meet criteria for the diagnosis as adult. You don't really "grow out" of ADHD — but many people do find the right strategies, careers, or support system to help significantly reduce symptoms and thrive in whatever they choose to do.

Edit1: WOW thank you for the gold kind stranger!! We're all in this together 😊

Edit2: [linky for the brave!](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/it-is-a-disorder-not-a-decision?utm_term=.biedZOqKJ#.qwwVeGBjR) Well huh


I'm definitely gonna show this to some people. Thanks for helping us not get sucked into Buzzfeed!

I feel no. 19 so hard  I've been loving this subreddit, and this is so helpful. (I'm a new mom to an 11yo with ADHD, so soaking up all and any information that can help me help him continue to thrive.) This list is so easy to share, and packs so much great information in. Thank you. Is there a way to collapse the text of each bullet point to be expandable? I would hate for this to end up being someone's reason for getting lost in a page for a day!! I formatted the best I could. Super great read. Wish I could introduce myself to new people using this article.  >**1. First of all, ADHD is a legitimate neurobehavioral disorder — it's not just feeling distracted and disorganized.**

This needs to be more publicized. People ALWAYS think that ADHD simply means you can't focus or sit still. Even my parents, to whom I've gone out of my way to educate them. 

>**2. The brain of someone with ADHD is literally different.**

It's not a choice, it's not some hormonal imbalance, we aren't "using it as an excuse".

>**4. There are actually three different types of ADHD.**

I'd call it a spectrum of ADHD. We seem to be in a place of liking that word, but it definitely fits. 

>**5. Actually being diagnosed with ADHD can be a long and frustrating process.**

This seems to be luck based. I've had a pretty lucky time with it, not having to go to multiple doctors, though my current one keeps asking if I can lower any of my meds every time lol 

I've read such horrible stories about this though. From a stay at home mother being told that she doesn't need meds because she doesn't have a real job,  to doctors straight up saying they don't believe in ADHD.

>**6. People with ADHD don't have a lack of knowledge, they just have trouble putting that knowledge into practice.**
>
>"ADHD is not a disorder of not knowing what to do, it is a disorder of not doing what you know," says Barkley.

I actually don't like Dr. Barkley's choice of words here. 

It's not "not doing what you know" that sounds more intentional. It's "not being able to access what you know when you need it".



>**8. But ADHD can affect all parts of your life, not just school or work.**

*Should* go without saying, it doesn't go away when you're not at school or work. 


>**11. Impulse control can be a major issue.**

*It IS a major issue* 

>**12. But it's not just a lack of willpower that's keeping you from focusing.**
>
>>"It's the I-would-if-I-could-but-I-can't feeling.

Yeah, except no one without it understands. It's not me being lazy,  I can't physically force myself to do it right now... 

>**13. Working memory is a huge problem, so people with ADHD often forget what they're doing.**

I'm surprised I've gotten this far in my reply. 

>**14. Having no concept of time is also a very real struggle.**

Can't plan for a future you can't comprehend. Makes being smart with money and keeping motivation nearly impossible. 

>**15. Medication helps, but it isn't a magic pill.**

Can't count the number of times "isn't this what you take medicine for?" Or "Why even take meds then?" Has been thrown at me. It's not take a pill that makes my mind grow lol it just helps me be a bit better. It has a cost too, it affects my mood, mainly after it wears off. 

>**16. People with ADHD usually need a lot of reminders to stay focused, manage time, and plan effectively.**

But not condescending... We are frustrated by our disorder MORE than others dealing with us. Trust me, we know,  and we hate it too


>**18. It may seem like people with ADHD are procrastinators, but it's really that they have trouble plotting out the steps to reach a goal.**

Plotting the steps and understanding time.

Plus time just disappears, going from 2 weeks due to oh shit its due in 3 hours...


Edit: To go along with this, we didn't ask to be born like this. We have to deal with ourselves **and** people acting like our adhd is a huge burden to them without realizing that *we are well aware that we have ADHD and have to live with it. It's not convenient excuses for us, or lucky we can get meds, it's so we can try to live our lives.* How many of us didn't finish reading this list? 😅 Number 6 is especially a sore spot for me.  I've often been the first person to grasp how to do things and to be able to help other people understand, but actually putting the knowledge in to action myself has been incredibly difficult.

Also, I have always had trouble being a friend because a lot of conversations revolved around references from last night's Simpsons episode or something, and even though I watched and enjoyed it, I could never remember any of the references when they were being made.  

It's tiring.  6. People with ADHD don't have a lack of knowledge, they just have trouble putting that knowledge into practice.

    "ADHD is not a disorder of not knowing what to do, it is a disorder of not doing what you know," says Barkley.

I get what he's trying to say here...but in reality it's more like "I know what I need to do.  I know how to do it.  I just can't figure out how I'm supposed to do it."

Or

"I'm looking at the map.  I'm hearing you tell me how to get from here to there.  I just don't understand HOW I'm supposed to get from here to there.  I know your telling me, I know your showing me.  I just don't get it." Thanks for helping a bit with eliminating one black hole of distraction.... much appreciated! 18 man. 18 kills me. I do it every fucking time. I leave my assignments till a week before then work super hard and generally do well, but I don't understand why I'm not doing that now when I have a month? I could do so much better. But there's no urgency in me, it may as well be next year. It's depressing. Running on fumes is a very good way to describe it. I need to save that one. (twitch) can’t think past each labeled as “1.”, else ty! Can we just like pin this in the subreddit? Lol New to this subreddit.

I feel like every post on here is so relatable and humanizing and reading things like this makes me literally break down in tears.

I was diagnosed with ADHD/OCD/Depression (and Tourette's, just for good measure) my senior year of High School, but I think in the overwhelming process of understanding and accepting my multiple diagnoses that somehow along the way I forgot to learn what ADHD actually was.

It wasn't until this year that I came across a podcast episode about adult women and ADHD and fell down an internet blackhole that's only recently lead me here. I think I literally yelled " WHY HASN'T ANYONE EVER TOLD ME THESE THINGS ARE SYMPTOMS AND NOT JUST SHITTY ASPECTS OF MY PERSONALITY??? " at my doctor (who, to be fair, wasn't the one who diagnosed me).

So weirdly, I feel like I did at 17 (I'm 28 now), and am trying to come to terms with the idea that so much of my frustration and anxiety and self-doubts and failures and aren't my fault. 

Lists like this make me feel human, and somehow this subreddit always leaves me in tears (of relief).

They also make me want to print out copies and hand them out to all my friends and family in hopes that they might understand my explanations aren't excuses... Can attest to IQ tests.  Before I was diagnosed, I scored 65.  A year after i was diagnosed, and had a good grove (still do) with treatment and meds, I retook it.  I scored 134.  The Psychiatrist was all like "What the fuck?"  Good list.

I like this one:
>/6. People with ADHD don't have a lack of knowledge, they just have trouble putting that knowledge into practice.

And this one frustrates me:
>/18. It may seem like people with ADHD are procrastinators, but it's really that they have trouble plotting out the steps to reach a goal.

I don't know about you guys, but far out deadlines seem perfectly real to me (as much as they are to anyone). Even when it doesn't "feel" real, I still cognitively know that it is. But, as with #6, the problem is "doing." I could make a good decision about when is a good time to get started, but making myself get started around that time is the hard part!

(Which leads to the one about feelings of fear.) I love Barkley! He’s been the lead international researcher on adhd for 30+ years. I’m glad they cited him. The work he had done has made for tremendous improvements for the lives of those who suffer from adhd. Man, I read the first 3 then the last two and some of the ones in the middle, some of the way. 

The one that stuck out to me was the need for therapy to be used along with medication. I hope the place I am going to offers good therapy if not Im going to be traveling to a larger city. As a programmer, I identify very well with #10.

When I am stuck on a problem, I will literally forego everything else just to figure out how to solve it. It actually becomes an obsession, and I (internally) freak out if I am forced to move on to something else before solving that problem. It's improved, but it is still pretty bad. When I start snapping at people when they break my concentration, that's indicative that I need to work on my "hyperfocus". thanks for sharing! Accurate to my experience, it's killing me. Thanks very much for this. I'm the dad of a 17-year-old ADHD boy, and I can't have enough reference material.... >in reality it's a very treatable disorder

If it is, why the hell can't I find a way to treat it? Where is this miraculous treatment? 22. People with ADHD are fed up with everyone’s disapproval and feel like all y’all can go fuck yourselves. 

23. People with ADHD look up occasionally and wonder where all the time has gone and why other parents can plan fun things with their kids but they can’t. 

24. People with ADHD forget that their own kids are also afflicted with the syndrome and are convinced that their kids are just being obstinate bastards. Excellent post.  First of all, thanks for listing them here. Buzzfeed has stolen Reddit posts for their own posts and sometimes not even giving credit. Would you happen to have the text of your post? It’s saying removed now, and it was *really* useful. I relate to number 9 a lot. One of the weird manifestations of my ADHD is my brains inability to "properly" focus on the person talking in a crowded or noisy room.  If someone is talking to me at a party and I'm not consciously and intently focusing on their mouths, it's impossible for me to discern their words. Yet, I find my ear "tuning in" to some other conversation across the table or beside me with perfect clarity! Sometimes using the other conversation's topic as a segway, which totally confuses those around me. It used to be really frustrating until I learned about how this related to ADHD. Now that I'm aware of it, I focus on the person talking and on the conversation in front of me, knowing that they're not hearing what I am, because their brains actually filter the ambient noise out.

I have had my hearing checked because of this symptom. Hold the fuck up, my shitty time management is a symptom? And all the bullet points are listed as #1 in Classic ADHD Fashion! Much as I dislike BuzzFeed, can you link to the article at the end of the post or something? They did put it together and should at least get a linkback. Yup this is basically me in a 21-compartment nutshell. What amazes me the most is that I didn't know until after I had passed forty fricking years. Was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in second grade. Now they’re telling me I’m cyclothymic and I never had ADHD. Everything going on in my life is still in criterion for ADHD. Should I get a second opinion? >15 Medication helps, but it isn't a magic pill.


I disagree.  Adderall **is** magic.  No, it doesn't fix everything, but it **IS** magic.



> 17 And finding the right environment and stimulation that helps you be more efficient is a huge deal.

WOW, I never knew this.  It totally explains why I'm able to get work done in my office (even when unmedicated), but I am basically unable to get the same work done anywhere else.  It doesn't matter that I've got my work laptop with me, it feels like I'm trying to perform delicate work while wearing hockey gloves... unless I'm in my office, where I can work without issue. wow this is great! thanks for sharing, i’m definitely gonna show this to some people  This is awesome! Thanks so much for posting.  Thanks for the info. Having a rough day, still got sidetracked. :/ But it is not your fault. The formatting is great. Buzzfeed is actually awesome with mental health issues, especially ADHD.   Excellent post.  I appreciate it, OP! I wish I could show this to the important people in my life.. without them scoffing at me. Thank you for copy and pasting. Very nice of you to take the time. Good article.  This really cleared up a lot of issues I am currently having. I was diagnosed when I was quite young and stopped taking medication in highschool due to feeling like a zombie and a lack of knowledge on the existance of other kinds of ADHD medication. After going through college and getting subpar grades and just having A LOT of these symptoms, I am finally goong back to the doctors to get back on track. Thank you for sharing. This really hits home. Thank you for posting this.
 Amazing post. Very spot on, definately something that cam help me explain it to people as why i am in my way in some areas of life. This is a great read. And so true on every point! Glad I read this list instead of doing other more important things. 

Just kidding this is a good list  I feel #14 so hard.  Hats off to Buzzfeed for this, and thanks OP for sharing it! What link is it? It says removed to me.  I love this. Thank you so much for posting this!!!! This gives me a lot of insight, and is helping me to understand myself better so that I can improve my life. 

I only have one question: could you possibly link the article? I want to see if they have sources/links and references on the actual website!  The part where it says it is very treatable is not completely true I feel. If it is a spectrum disorder, necessarily there must also be a range in the treat-ability. Otherwise one pill would serve all, one CBT would serve all, etc. There is no guarantee all ADHD can be mitigated and success rates will differ.

Or maybe I am too 19.
 > So even one sad news headline or the thought of a new relationship can completely derail someone's day.

Derailed myself today by accidentally calling a girl I like "mate" I found this subreddit yesterday and have been reading this post over and over again. I know I have ADHD because others see it, ask me about it but I just haven't gone to a Dr yet (planning on going very soon). Anyway, I have really enjoyed this post because it is nice to see that these issues are shared by so many people (I know, it's very cliche). Thanks again and great job OP. In regards to #4 I think this link gives more details to that point.
https://www.healthyplace.com/adhd/articles/characteristics-of-add/  I know this will probably my get buried, but thank you so much for this!!! My son (6.5) was just diagnosed, we’ve suspected because his dad has it, but I’ve been trying to find support and information. This write up was awesome!! We have other meeting scheduled but I wanted some of my own research and this was great! Reddit usually is the best place to go.  20 plus being an artist go figure Does anyone think meditation helps ADHD symptoms?  Man I wish I could explain this to people without them thinking I'm just making excuses  #20 oh God. I know I can do stuff, the problem is I can't do it consistently.  . I would like to point out that ADHD is not a disorder, but a collection of unique qualities that many (unfortunate) people were not born with. Extremely successful people in society are able to manage and use the positive attributes of ADHD to their advantage. Many intelligent and inventive people in history, including Thomas Edison, displayed clear signs of ADHD. I get tired of hearing that, because you are not "normal" like all the other zombie robots out there, you have some sort of major disorder. This condition should be renamed in a positive way, and the lucky people who have  it should be proud that they have been blessed to have such unique and dynamic qualities! 

Edit: Don't take drugs. Channel your abilities. Learn to live with creativity. Printed it out, it's a great list! Yep. The worst for me is actually having my positive emotions go on a runaway track. 

It tends to freak people out that I get so excited and happy that they feel it's either fake or I'm just a nut. Very difficult when making friends or pursuing new relationships because nobody tends to mirror my emotions and the extremes that I express tend to be turn offs. 

I never thought that would be such a problem, but, I've found that it hinders me socially more than my negative emotions (I've at least had practice in suppressing those over the years and so can now dial them down easier than overwhelming positive emotions).

tl;dr: I'm annoying and overly excitable :(

Edit: 

For anyone feeling down because they relate to what I shared in this post, keep in mind that this is just one unfortunate aspect of expressing positive emotion so heavily. In reality I wouldn't trade it for the world. I've had such moments of joy/love/ecstasy/happiness/excitement/etc that I couldn't possibly wish it were any other way.

I know that when people don't understand how a display of emotion in this fashion could be normal/healthy/acceptable, they are revealing their own self imposed limitations and expectations. I have compassion for people who's good time could be stopped by my good time, simply because it seems to exceed the limit of what they deem acceptable for themselves. 

Some people just don't get as excited, and that's fine. If they find themselves judging others for not being like them, or altogether being derailed from their own good time by seeing someone else's, that's a heavy trip to have in life. Sometimes I wish people could feel what I feel. Positive and negative.  As number 19 is about feeling things so hard, I’m having a hard time feeling you’re not being ironic.

But I feel you. Yep. God forbid I match with someone that seems interesting on tinder. I'll be thinking about our potential relationship constantly until we meet and find out I was building her up way too much in my head for it to ever be successful. You're a wonderful mother Make sure to send this to your teacher or someone at your school. Unfortunately, ADHD is still misunderstood at schools.... coming from a teacher with ADHD Thank you so much for supporting this child any way you can! My mother meant well when she kept the possibility of an adhd diagnosis away from me, but it was at about 11 that I really started to struggle. Unfortunately she didn't connect the dots and revisit the ADHD idea. You're doing what I wish my mother had done! God bless you!

For the record, my mom is amazing. She just didn't yet "get it" 20 years ago.  Good for you!

Just a question: has anyone else in your family been diagnosed? ADHD has a strong genetic component. It's not unusual for a kid with ADHD to have at least one parent with ADHD. (I suspect that I'm at least third generation.) Honestly I think you did a very good job formatting it as is. Very easy to just skim through the list and read any one particular section that stands out to you. I think it's good as is.  12/10, skimmed and caught like 6 words.  It's definitely about ADHD.  Will save and read later when I hyperfocus on my bookmarks. Please don't forget to link to the original source material from which thes guys pulled their quotes and information: 

Dr. Russell A. Barkley, ADHD-The thirty essential ideas you should know about ADHD. It's about 3 hours of content packaged in 10-15 min intervals.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY Spoiler tags make it collapsible Nope, unfortunately, reddit doesn't support that. Literally my first thought was "I should read this but it's so much scrolling and no pictures"

You did great though, bub 👍 You are so thoughtful!! Thanks for posting it in text here. You did well. Thank you! I agree or showing up to family functions with this article.  > 12 But it's not just a lack of willpower that's keeping you from focusing.
> "It's the I-would-if-I-could-but-I-can't feeling.

>> Yeah, except no one without it understands. It's not me being lazy, I can't physically force myself to do it right now...

SO true.  Until medication, I could never understand how people could study for several hours. I thought they were just more disciplined than me.  But after 1 day of medication, I realized that they can "just study" without having to fight themselves to do it.   ADHD doesn't quite fit on a spectrum, since that implies that inattention is on one end and hyperactivity is on the other - and that people with both have lesser symptoms than people who are primarily one or the other.

It's more like we have two dials, one for inattention and one for hyperactivity, and all of us have at least one turned up too high haha Thanks for the thoughtful replies!  Number 8 I think needs to be much bigger in the public eye. It takes away so many possibilities in your life. [deleted] I did! Then I forgot all but two I read the whole thing but I have several assignments that i should be doing instead I finished it, but accidentally doubled the length of my usual break at work...  i 'nope' out of anything that doesn't have a tl;dr and it didn't dawn on me that was the ADHD until this very moment.  Absolutely.  I think that second analogy is excellent. It's like having a map, having Point A and Point B marked, and you can see that there are streets connecting Points A and B, but none of the streets are marked and sometimes the streets are closed without notice.  "ADHD is not a disorder of not knowing what to do, it is the inability to do what you know" maybe For me it's like riding a bike. ("riding a bike" being "focusing on a task") Yes, once you learn how, you don't really forget. Most people know how to grab any bike and just ride. I have to get mine out from behind the lawnmower in the shed every time.

To most people, "Just grab your bike and go" or "Just buckle down and focus"

I AM grabbing my bike and going, but SIMPLE isn't always EASY. It just takes more effort for us than many people realize.

And getting distracted and moving on to a different task entirely is like finding a new bike leaning on your shed on the way to the bike you meant to ride. At the time it's like, "Why shouldn't I just do this instead?"  Yeah! I happened to come across it, and I was like man, I want /r/ADHD to know about this but I barely made it through with the images and spam distractions all over that dumb site, let me post it in plain text! :) "Now or not now" holy shit. I manage to do things in advance 75% of the time by maintaining a level of anxiety and paranoia that subconciously convinces me that everything is due tomorrow :)

the other 25% I burn out completely and begin studying for a final the day of...  I just had to switch degrees with only 12 hours left in a BS in Chemistry, because last minute no longer works. Everything that’s left is essentially a series of semester-long projects. ~200 pages of writing, and PChem 2 is too complicated for me to understanding without continuous studying (essentially a semester-long project).

I’m not trying to bum you out; I’m hoping to encourage you to go find every bit of help you can now. 

I found, just months ago, a place at my school called the “student success center” where you can meet with academic helper people, and they will help you plan out anything, even just a single assignment.

I’m too burnt out and in debt to keep trying right now. Does it ever work the opposite way for you too? I put something in the microwave for 2 minutes. I started doing some cleaning in another room and freaked out because I forgot all about my Hot Pocket. Then when I walked in the kitchen, the microwave was a few seconds away from being finished. I swear it felt like I was busy for 10 minutes or more.  Must be whichever client you're using - they're all numbered in the desktop and Boost, sorry! also. regarding #13.

I often have to chant the name of whatever item I'm trying to find so I don't forget while I'm flailing around halfway under my bed... Yep, I sure as heck know when the event is, I just can't convince myself to get ready. I even *like* getting things done/being places early, but what a struggle to start. It’s not real in that you have no motivating stress response to it. People w/o ADHD picture the consequences, and have an intuitive understanding of the future consequences, and they experience motivating stress that lets them work now even though the consequences are so far off. ADHD people can understand the consequences, and worry about them and the future, but we just don’t feel a push-to-action from it.

Please note that motivating stress is not at all the same thing as anxiety. Different experience here! Far out deadlines always feel "far out" to me. It's like I have a more innate grasp of "dates" than I do of "times". Every deadline, from work to family to budgeting to whatever winds up in my head like this current example: "My friend is visiting on January 13, ~~but I don't have to prepare for it because that's like 3 weeks from now~~ and oh shit that's this weekend." For me procrastination is a very real thing. If I know doing a certain task will be unpleasant (because it will take a long time, a lot of effort, or if I have failed the same task before) I will go out of my way to avoid it.  
The thing about "how to get srarted" is also very real, but it seems two separate things.  I agree. I KNOW it's real, and KNOW that it should take X amount of time for X amount of days to finish, but I don't FEEL that urgency until I get way past the optimal start time. Especially when cramming has worked out *okay* in the past.  Try reading out loud, it really helps.  this made me smile because yesterday I filled out a really long questionnaire from my therapist and i filled out the first two pages, then got distracted, restless, went back to front, accidentally got them all out of order and then filled out random questions.  Hyper focus might be the biggest issue in my relationships, work and social.  God bless you!  treatable, not curable  I feel you. I know you love those kids, too. There are a lot of parents that are shittier than us, so try not to beat yourself up too much.
 Reload the page, automoderator screwed up, the post has been restored. I would say "I hear ya!" to your comment, but.. 😉

For real though, I struggle with this one a lot. Even if it's just my wife and I talking one on one, or my boss, even in an otherwise empty room, my focus wanders to the computer screen they're trying to show me, or on composing my response in my head to the first thing they said so that I don't forget it, while completely tuning out the second and third thing they said!!  Same for me as well. I always thought it was my hearing that was the root cause. I can speak to someone in a crowded room or bar and the second I hear laughter or a louder voice from somewhere in the room, my focus automatically veers in that direction. I’ll still be hearing what your say but no longer listening to what you are saying.  ABSOLUTELY!

It manifests in the way that if your executive functions can't differentiate time discretely, then you have trouble defining the exact time that it is, and how much time you have left to accomplish something, be it a project due in two weeks, or just trying to leave in 20 minutes!  Which client are you using? I heard someone else say the same thing but they show up properly numbered on my clients (desktop and Boost for Android)!  Adding it to the OP now, I've just been really wary of adding it because I know that at least for me, Buzzfeed can be a quick hour wasted!  I was almost 48. So many things make sense now.  If you identify with some of the things in this (albeit not authoritative) list, I think it's probably a good idea to get a second opinion, yes.  Absolutely! You can also be both.  What does adderall do? I think one of the most useful tools in our toolbelt is to show others that we are not alone. 

Additional voices expressing the same things we are trying to express can go a long way to solidifying our thoughts and showing that we're not just "making this up." 

I've recommended it before, but there are some great episodes of the Faster Than Normal podcast that speak to the everyday challenges of having ADHD, as well as for those living with us. 

The stigmas will always forge on until we push to change the narrative! 😊 Try again, automoderator got a little zealous and removed the post after an edit.  It's been reapproved. Thanks for the link! So wonderful to hear!!  I've been trying to get into it, but with varied success on actually being able to make it a defined part of my schedule. I like the initial little boost of clarity that comes from opening my eyes after a short meditation (much like how the sky appears that much bluer and vibrant after closing your eyes for a while at the beach), but it's hard to say with absolute certainty that it's benefiting me. I'd like to explore it more.

Aura is a great daily mindfulness app that has a short (and I mean SHORT, like 3 minutes or less!) meditation that can fit into any schedule, unlike longer ones like Headspace. That’s a really irresponsible reply.  While I agree with and love the idea that our brains work in a special way and if channeled properly, can be incredibly useful, I take issue with painting with such a wide brush. While yes, there are many advantages to our chemistry, there are many of us who aren't taken seriously, who can't get systems in place because we're too scattered, who can't get medication in the first place to be able to focus straight enough to GET said systems in place. 

I've heard it put that often medication can act as "lifting up the house to fix the foundation", and once you have a stable foundation of habits, routines and systems, that you no longer need to medicate. And that's absolutely fine for some people, some "houses". But other houses are subject to high winds, floods, or tornadoes and need extra bracers, reinforced walls, and triple-pane windows just to be able to live in the "house" they have. 

Being overtly dismissive of medication is dangerous, and it's naive to blanket that we should all just only look at the positives and just "be better". Telling someone with ADHD to just "learn to live with creativity" is the same as telling someone with bulimia to just "learn to live with not being super thin". It doesn't help the narrative at all. While I do understand your point, that ADHD can be a "superpower" when channeled positively (I really do like Shankman, btw), there are so many for whom it's not so cut and dry. Please be more judicious.  Aye. I shared it on my Facebook. It's very informative. SAME. I sometimes wonder how I kept it all in long enough to get someone to marry me lol. It's been the biggest relief. But I sometimes think back to times when I've scared off potential friends and it bothers me that I don't realize I'm overwhelming them until it's too late :/ You are lucky that you have any enthusiasm left for anything > tl;dr: I'm annoying and overly excitable :(

Same :( most people hate me when they first meet me. my two closest friends said that they thought i was fake, and very bad at hiding it :(  I feel you 100% Haha I thought about saying something to that effect but decided against it ;) That is so kind. I am working on it! (new parent, we adopted him.) He is so, so talented and full of amazing skills and perspectives. We are working as a family to shift the old (inaccurate) narrative of "I'm a bad kid," or "I'm not good at school," to be more reflective of his gifts and how hard he works. So understanding ADHD has been huge for me to picture how he's working and what things are extra-frustrating.  Happy cake day! Thank you so much for saying this. We really work to help him understand the things he is awesome at (physical activity, reading, making speeches, remembering things, handwriting, taking care of animals, music...) and that all of us have things that don't come easily. But there are tools and strategies, so let's find them and practice them. So I think for him, knowledge is power. Thank you! We're adoptive parents, and he's been with us for a year and a half... so I don't know. I myself struggle with anxiety, as does he, so we often talk about our brains and how they can bully us (or work seemingly against us) and how we can be clever and creative to find new ways to work things out.  lol I feel you.
 I just figured the less rabbit holes to get sucked down the better. Thanks for the link! 😊 I’m 60 and just discovering that my life long afflictions fit into the ADHD basket and this is the most informative and accessible information to date. Greatly appreciated. Thanks for the hard work. Lol on a business card which you hold out and it just folds out like an accordion of facts about me. Exactly, though *several* hours of it would be really hard for me lol Yeah under "it has a cost" you forgot "normal" sex life. 

Can't tell you how many times while having sex my mind is like: 

sex
sex
sex
sex
sex
sex
what am going to have for dinner?

I desperately WANT to focus on my partner but sometimes stuff just pops in my head and I can't focus. 
Sometimes it makes it physically impossible and women don't like hearing or believe you when you tell them it's your fault. 

They usually take it personally which makes a mortifying experience worse. 

 i cannot picture myself sitting down and doing my chapters for my law class... such a foreign concept. i have to break down my chapter in like 10-12 minute increments. To be completely honest, just picturing myself sitting down and studying makes me want to cry.   I watched a Barkley video earlier and [he thinks that there are no subtypes of ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbpHJvOups) but that [some people with ADHD-PI might actually be SCT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmaA5zwNYQQ) I like the dial idea! Sounds better yeah Moreso spending money without thinking lol...

But I've *definitely* done some stupid shit that could have killed or injured me,  like broken and stranded shit same.... I got really into reading it then I realized.. I didn't retain any of it. BUT what is fucking ridiculous.. if you bring up a point I'll be able to recall it once it's brought up by someone else.  a lot of times I know what I need to do, I just don't understand how to do it, or even how to start, or even lack the ability to start. when someone tells me something is "easy peasey" I want to bitch slap the fucking shit out of them, because for me, it's not. Yeah! This is why my personal unhealthy coping strategy is maintaining a high level of anxiety. You're never late if everything feels like it's due tomorrow! I even catch the teapot before it boils.

until you burn out. heh I use the iPhone reddit app and they are all 1. But I got through it after I sat it down several times, got a drink, switched to check on a different app, played animal crossing, and did dishes.   Oh god yeah! I do that, and then I have that word running through my head at random times throughout the day.  I do this! Or another trick I developed from this is the word and counting down from some number that makes sense so that I don't start focusing on the sound or rhythm of the word. So like, "charger.. 3,2,1, charger.. 3,2,1" You said what I said but better. Thanks! Haha I do this when my brain starts not wanting to take in information and it really helps. Even if I'm just mouthing the words. so funny but i read out-loud my college textbook chapter because i was trying to record it, hoping that I could listen to it while driving an actually retain the information and I discovered that simply reading the information out-loud i actually remembered the content!! Thank god, because I forgot to press 'record' because I was so focused on trying to get through the gravity of the task at hand. If that isn't the perfect example of ADHD then I dont know what is.  Thank you! You as well! Not to mention that "treatability" is not always the same as "accessibility to treatment", unfortunately.  Thank you! Well. Shit. Mobile. Reddit App on an iPhone 5S It’s a stimulant that tells the frontal cortex to wake the heck up. On non-ADHD people, it’s like drinking 10 cups of coffee, but it just catches us up. 

It’s one of several stimulants that help treat ADHD. There are several non-stimulants, too.  Stimulants basically enable our "motors" to start easier.

**Consider it this way:** you're trying to start your lawnmower. You know there's plenty of gas, you keep pulling the cord in vain, but the engine just won't turn over no matter how hard you pull. Think of Adderall, etc. as the primer pump on the lawnmower, getting a little gas into your "carburetor" so your "engine" can finally bridge that gap to where pulling the cord actually starts the engine! 

It doesn't mean your lawnmower is broken, it just means that it sometimes needs a little something to help it start. Hope that explanation helps! Thank you for the fantasic reply! I'll have to check out that podcast! I'll re-add the link. I actually pulled it thinking that was the reason it was modded!  I feel like meditation has helped me somewhat but also my ADHD symptoms are much less severe now (I'm 19) than they were when I was younger. Also I've been using headspace for 2 months for meditation & it's pretty great but today I meditated naturally in the outdoors and I might start doing that more often when spring approaches. People like to have fun...just not TOO MUCH fun I guess lol. Even when everyone else is visibly having a good time, as soon as I start 'crossing a line' in respects to appearing too happy or excited, people tend to shed their smiles for concerned or judging looks. Apparently, I laugh too loud too often and smile too wide. Some people must think that's creepy or something...weirdos! lol
 Yep it's difficult to do anything now, but I'll be damned if I take meds again.  Tired of that rollercoaster. Sometimes it gets hard to have enthusiasm. When I've been severely depressed and lacked coping skills, I fell into a black hole of apathy, anger, alcohol, and aversion. It took a lot of hard times and hard won personal victories to dig myself out. Years.

I still get depressed, sometimes severely. Sometimes I need help. But, over time the crests and valleys of the waves of life get you into a sort of rhythm. At least I've felt so. I can anticipate when things will get worse and better. And they do get worse. And they do get better.  

When people take my enthusiasm as a sort of pathology (he's TOO joyful/unpredictable/uninhibited/etc) it takes the wind out of my sails for a time. But, I know it will come back. I know because that natural inclination towards uninhibited joy that comes out in my best moments is something inside me. 

There are things out there for each of us that give us that spark. If you find yourself having fewer and fewer bouts of happiness or enthusiasm, reach out and reach inward. There's work to do. 

I've also been very lucky. So good luck to anyone who needs it. Exactly ,this a positive attribute I feel and shouldn't be dimmed! There are times when we might actually be acting 'fake'. I know there are certainly times where I've been playing it up or down not entirely out of honest feeling but for some desired effect. We've all done it. But, it is damaging to believe that we always act this way, or even a good amount of the time. If we are being fake, that's up for us to realize and change (while not being hard on ourselves for it).

For all the times when our genuine selves come out and people can't seem to believe it to be real, we have to become secure in knowing that who we are isn't dependent on what other people perceive or expect. 

Life is long, there will be many opportunities to get to know ourselves and find like-minded companions. It sounds like you're having a tough time now. There can be nothing lonelier than being surrounded by friends who you feel don't 'get' or understand you. This will pass in time. This is a great community for info! Glad I could be of service :) QR code I just remember when I was in college, I knew of people who would spend several hours over a couple of weeks studying for their finals.  And I could never do it... I'd be there with the books in front of me **trying** to study, but my brain would just say "nope".  I'd fight through it for about an hour, and then break down in tears, deciding "I don't care if I fail the test, I can't do this anymore".  And I honestly believed that all of that was due to me just being lazy and not willing to put forth the effort that they did. 

^(And then I'd still end up getting one of the highest grades in the class, go figure.) I'm in class right now and can't follow the link, what is SCT?

Edit: Found it, Sluggish Cognitive Tempo yeah- pictures, stories etc will bring back memories of mine from a decade ago, and I'll remember almost everything about it, but if you flat out asked me without any of that, my mind is just blank. YES it's all about starting something for me. It's like, there's a jumble of info and I'm trying to grab onto just one piece of it but it's flying around in a wind tunnel. But once I can grab just one little part of it, I can start working through it and the wind tunnel shuts off. I think non-ADHD people don't have the wind tunnel on at all.  I can never figure out where to start! I’ve bombed enough chemistry finals because I know the material but I can’t figure out which to put into practice. I’ve asked my professors if there was a strategy but just ended up getting a lecture on the material that I already knew. Its like I understand the questions and the equations but I don’t know which to use without serious context.  I’ve used this strategy for as long as I can remember, it’s a great one. (autocorrected from tragedy, ha... :\ )


And by “great” I mean a truly magnificent way to drive yourself certifiably bonkers while going undiagnosed for a decade. Me too! Slows my pace, but at least I will actually finish it (usually)!  Well, now you have a name for it, at least. It's been so heartening to learn more and more about our condition and what is and isn't just "I'm bad at.."  Strange! I wonder if it interprets Markdown differently? Each "bullet point" starts with two asterisks for "bold", I wonder if it thinks that's the start of an ordered list.  Yes it does. Thank you! So it doesn't improve your focus levels or attention span? That's awesome! Keep us posted :) I feel your pain every day. Today I am on the other end of the spectrum. I have been stressed for the last two weeks due to struggles at work. :(  I recently switched to XR, and it really helps with mood  You might want to look into a different type of medication, there are tons! Extended release stimulants like someone else mentioned, but also non stimulant medication like Wellbutrin and Strattera and Clonidine. In addition, our responses to medications can change over time, so if it's been a while it might be worth another try.

The point is, never rule anything out wholesale - that just limits your options! I can't count the number of times I've sat down to study, read a page or two and went "what did I just read?"

But yes still one of the highest grades too lol That's my problem too.  I can't test.  Give me an IQ test, and your lucky if I shit out a 37.  Yes, that happened.  Even on meds, and following my treatment plan 100000000%  I look at the IQ test and think WTF?? This shit makes no god dam fucking sense.

Same with finals, tests, a quiz.  Might as well skip to the part I get the lecture after failing it. 

Put me in a chemistry lab or have me do a project where I have to show case what I know?  Have me do a presentation that explains recent research into making vaccines even safer? Make an entertaining power point presentation highlighting changes in state employment law for 2018?   I'm that person who can be given 2 weeks or 15 minutes and still shit out fucking gold.

Hold a conversation (NOT LECTURE) with me on the subject material I'm struggling with?  Turns out I understand more than you assume I do.  I just understand it in a different way than everybody else does.

I just can't for the love of god fucking shit out the answers I'm supposed in the format I'm supposed to when it comes to tests.  Yet the test is the only thing that matters-not the fact I can apply what I've learned in every way possible BUT the fucking way I'm supposed to.

Can I assume your the same way?

I hate ADHD at times! I mean, it does, in a way. It boosts your ability to make the connections needed to focus, so that when you do focus, it taps into your "superpower" to focus hardcore. It basically brings you up to or above a normal person's attention span and focus level.  I hope you're feeling better! It's hard to leave work struggles at work. They tend to hitch a ride in our minds and make themselves at home during 'free time'. 

You'll be TOO happy again in no time ;) Same, instants give me insane ups and downs. XR works much better. Wow, I gotta get me some of that.
