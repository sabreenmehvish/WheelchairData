Tricks I use to stay organized and turn out higher quality work. Hey ADHD, 

In highschool I graduated with a 2.1 gpa due to general disorganization and apathy due to my ADHD. 4 years later I graduated college at the top of my class and I am now attending a top tier law school. I just wanted to share some tips that really helped me succeed academically. 

I Colorcoded EVERYTHING. I bought a file folder and had an obnoxious brightly colored folder for each class. I also put a colored sticker corresponding to each class on all the material I recieved in that class. Throughout the school year I periodically become incredibly disorganized and this helps me reorganize as well as help me build a more systematic conception of a classes subject material. Highlighters work great with this strategy too.

I really struggle with knowing how to organizer and revise papers. There's Something I have never been able to grasp about the way non-ADHD people are able to organize and present material so clearly. I almost always used to procrastinate writing until the night before and then would spend 13 hours straight writing the research paper I should have spent the entire semester writing.  My new strategy is to TRANSFER MEDIUMS. Hand write the first paper out. Then write it again This forces you to review all the material when you type the final draft.

Flashcards for tests and quizzes. My short term memory is garbage and my longterm is not much better. I can't study using any other method for more than 20 minutes before I stop retaining information. I think this method works so well for me because quickly switching between concept and corresponding definition allows my horrible attention span to pick up the information. 

I can think of more Tips but this has already turned into a monster text block.  Let me know what study strategies have worked for you!

TL;DR color coding subjects, hand writing papers, and flashcards among other strategies have helped me improve my academic performance. [deleted] I would love to hear more tips! I've tried color coding and it worked for me but I got too lazy. I didn't do it to the extent you did, so I am going to try again next semester using your technique instead.  I am always looking for more and new tips to help me be able to study efficiently. What I found that works for me when studying is to study in a group. They kept me on track and we bounced ideas off of each other  Could you please elaborate a bit more about that colour coding technique? 

All I got was that you put all the materials for classes into bright coloured folders. What am I missing? **WHITE BOARD!!!** --
I hang it on the wall of my dorm room opposite my bed so that when I'm on my laptop screwing around on the internet it's facing me. I use color coded markers to write down assignments as soon as I get them on one half, and random things to do (like do laundry) on the other half in a different color. Then I write dates they need to be completed by next to them. 

I cross them out instead of erasing them and then erase all the completed stuff every weekend. Crossing them out instead of erasing lets me see that I've been productive instead of just staring at a list of uncompleted tasks, and it's really satisfying. I haven't forgotten about an assignment in the year since I started doing this (yes, I've failed to do some, but not *forgotten* about any :P )

On my computer, I made a folder for each course and put it in a semester folder and label every document appropriately no matter how much it annoys me. It saves me from losing files.

I go to the library to study. It's annoying, but I feel obligated to work if I'm there. Sometimes it helps to go with one of my more focused friends, because I feel bad sitting next to them fucking around on the internet (though you have to be careful which friends because often it's more distracting than helpful)

I listen to white noise or rain sounds while I do my homework to block out other people when lyrics would be distracting

If I'm doing a reading for a class and it's a book/handout that I'm allowed to write in, I underline, highlight, and annotate to an annoying degree... not because I'll go back and reread my notes later, but because it forces me to actively process the material.  **PLANNERS. SO MANY PLANNERS AND LISTS.**

One for school assignments and appointments, due dates, etc.
A blank tiny notebook for non-school related daily tasks but also anything else I need to write down, budgeting information, grocery lists, shopping lists, other lists. . . I don't know why, but I like this system.

This one is kind of my favorite.

**Mostly Healthy Eating & Cost-Effective Groceries**:

* Step 1. Write down everything I want to be able to eat for the next month or so separated by meals: Breakfast, Snacks, Lunch/Dinner.

* Step 2. Make a checklist of the things I need to buy in order to have the ingredients for all of these foods, obviously keep in mind what I already have.

* Step 3. Go to grocery store and take list with me, scribble down the approximate price of each item next to it, rounding up to accommodate for tax to keep an idea of cost.

* Step 4. Go home and cook and eat and cook! 

***Bonus***: When I'm not sure what I want to eat, I consult the list! No more repeated opening and closing of the fridge and pantry trying to figure out what food combinations I can make. =]

Edit: fuck, formatting.

Edit again:

I also created something akin to a personal shorthand for myself. . . sort of. When I'm taking notes I like using stars and arrows and bullets and such, so I thought I should probably make a list notating what means what and then use it consistently to make note-taking easier and more efficient.

And I realized my grocery thing is entirely unrelated to school . . but . . healthy body healthy mind? Yeah?
 Our short term memory is better than everyone else's, our problem is our ability to commit it to working memory, and in term, long term memory. We need to find strategies to pick out the different sensory input in our short term that we want to keep, and commit them to memory.  I can't write entire papers by hand, but I'll often use this method to work through a particularly tricky section or paragraph, or one I've been putting off for a long time. 

I type pretty fast so whenever I try to write something out by hand I get frustrated because my hand can't keep up with my mind. I'm not sure how people do it (It's even slower than texting!) and manage to have decent handwriting.  Yup, this is exactly how I feel, and that's why I also write all my essays by hand and then transcribe them later. Tell me about it! That's one thing I struggle with the most when I type my papers.  I can go back and change the wording and sentence structure for hours, only to realize the distinction is nearly completely arbitrary and I should just move on. Writing it all out has also improved my handwriting a ton!  Yep I will for sure post some more tips! And I totally understand the laziness thing, color coding notes can seem like a daunting task. A simpler solution than stickers is to just take a colored sharpy and draw a line across all of the edges of a notebook that you intend to use for that class. That way, every page has a little reference color along the edge! Yeah, color coding within notes is hard to keep up with.  The trick that works for me is to start out ridiculously organized. Then, even though it slips throughout the semester, I'm still at least a little organized by the end. And a bonus: it's much harder to procrastinate on studying if you're meeting with other people to do it! 

I almost never say no to a study group, even if it's for an "easy" course, because I can help explain the material to my friends, and I end up retaining it better that way. Plus, it's good karma, and there are plenty of other classes where my friends' superior study skills have carried me through an exam I'd have bombed otherwise.  I like studying in groups for classes that I'm interested in, but when it's something I don't care about at all there is no way ill participate or listen to the discussion. These classes are the hardest for me. 

What I usually do for these classes is Wall myself off completely from humanity/games/distraction and sit there with the material I need to learn.  I'll usually stare off into space doing nothing for about 10-20 minutes then out of boredom/madness I'll start reading and making flashcards.  

This may be just a personal thing but I find it really helpful to organize your course load with a few classes you like and a few that are necessary weevils. If you end up taking all the classes you like in a few semesters you may be stuck with a couple semesters of straight horribly boring Classes. It's WAY harder to stay motivated with 4 subjects that you hate than 2 you enjoy and two you endure.  I color code all the folders and The material in the folder, that way when the inevitable happens and I have start mindlessly shoving papers/notes into my back pack, is easier to reorganize.  Also for some reason when I have my notes for a subject all consolidated in one place it's easier to recall previous material and stay current on new material.  White boards don't really work for Me, I usually just end up forgetting to use it and every once in awhile write down a random list of tasks I need to do.  I also pretty much only study in the library because of how quiet it is.  Actively reading as well as listening is a huge deal for me.  Tomorrow I'll post some more tips and include My strategy for active reading and listening I do not share your enthusiasm for planners and lists. Planners will inevitably become lost and forgotten within a month, and for some reason making lists seems to promote my anxieties more than relieve them, which causes me to become apathetic about everything. Even on things as simple as a grocery list, lol.  I think it's because I don't trust myself to produce all of the necessary information that I need.  

For school, what works for me is taping the syllabi for each class up on the wall in front of my desk and write little notes on them, that way I'm constantly reminded of what I need to do for that day and it doesn't require me to keep track of a small book lol.  I have yet to develop a strategy to effectively grocery shop lol.  I swear it takes me atleast 5 times longer to shop for half as many groceries as a non ADHD person.
