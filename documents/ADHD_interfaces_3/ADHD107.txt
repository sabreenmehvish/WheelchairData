My obsession with knowledge and information. I'm not the smartest person, at best I would call myself average. I'm not particularly amazing at anything but, I know a little bit about most things. I constantly have this thirst for more information, and a million things I want to learn more about. I spend almost all of my free time reading and all of my commute times listening to audiobooks, the news, or TED talks. There is not much time of any given day that I am not actively learning something. 

My problem, what I hope y'all are able to offer suggestions for is how to continue learning as much as possible but with more direction, consistency, and retention. 

Part of my problem is that my interest are so varied. I've pursued years of education in mathematics, computer science, engineering, diagnostic medicine, and biotechnological researchers and development. I ended up finishing a degree in nursing, work in an ICU, and I am pursuing a career in nursing anesthesia. I study medicine, but my hobbies are photography, hiking, backpacking, and traveling. I love philosophy and discovering logical fallacies in myself, my peers, and our society. I I find classical text to be a strong basis for a variety of lessons. I use theological text from different theologies for guidance on being a better person and leading a proper life. I read "self help" books for emotional intelligence, increases productivity, and guidance on how to learn and succeed. Business, finance, and leadership books guide my professionalism and leadership skills. Politics keeps me in touch with the happenings of the US and the world. Biographies and people's story sharing of real life events are captivating. Most of all though I have never gotten bored listening to or reading books related to various fields of sciences. 

I realized today I am listening to a vast variety of content, in a seemingly random order of greatest momentary whim. Due to this I am not able to efficiently string together concepts from various subjects, and my retention of information is lower than I would like. 

I would like to develop some form of direction to my thirst for knowledge, be able to retain the information better, and pull together the information from different fields and subjects. 

I can't wait to hear any suggestions y'all have to help out with this. I would also love any suggestions you have for books to read in any of the above categories or to increase general knowledge. 

Edit: I have ADHD which plays into some of this.  Not to be too verbose, but "Same!" 

I had 5 majors in college because as soon as I'd get set in one, I'd have to take an unrelated course as part of my degree and fall in love with that one (History -> Psychology -> Economics -> Geology -> Management Information Systems)

At my last job, my boss bought us the "Strengths Finder" book. My top 5 were

 * **Input** (People strong in the Input theme have a craving to know more. Often they like to collect and archive all kinds of information.)
 * **Ideation** (People strong in the Ideation theme are fascinated by ideas. They are able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena.)
 * **Learner** (People strong in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.)
 * **Relator** (People who are strong in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.)
 * **Analytical** (People strong in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.)

The cool thing about this test is that the results are personalized with tips/ideas of things to apply your strengths to every-day things. 

I swear I'm not a salesman... lol Hear hear. In the past years I researched, amon other things: computer science (this one for years), stand up comedy, augmented reality, hardware, virtual reality, chatbots, search engines, mobile apps, dancing, biotechnology, fashion, virtual reality again, and now neuroscience, which led me to my diagnosis of ADHD.

I always tried to be an entrepreneur, but struggled a lot with keeping focus over 6 months. And with time, I was simply unable to reply to e-mails, and I procrastinated a lot unless I was filled with a ridiculous amount of coffee and sweets.

Anyway, now I'm considering how to proceed with my life, now that the diagnosis is there.

The options I'm considering. One would be to figure out a career of consultant, or a startup-launcher, who helps people with something cool for 3-6 months, and then parts ways. In general people listen to my opinions, and I've got crazy amounts of business-useful knowledge.
The benefit is that I think I could pull it off almost med-free. Only when I'd have to write an article, reply to some e-mails from time to time and so on..

Another option would be to try and build a business on my own, and stick to one field this time. Even after the 6-month novelty period wears off, I can probably keep doing work using meds. I guess I could build something huge then, but I'd have to do meds daily. Journalism maybe? If deadlines aren't your sworn enemy that is. It makes me happy that you described liking a lot of the same diverse subject matter. Adhd meds have allowed me for the first time in life(I got diagnosed last year at 23), to organize and synthesize info coherently-ish. My mind will always be able to speak better than I can write but I have seen improvement none the less. Diagnosis provided me the ability to finish a fricken book for once and not always needing something stimulating to keep my attention. I'd say journalism - or anthropology, or be on like an ethics board for biomedical research. Let me know what you decide, I wish you the best. Might be a little late in posting, but I feel the same exact way, I have ADHD and have been told by many friends that i'm like a walking encyclopedia, I know a little bit about a lot of different things. I'm currently studying International Relations and Global Studies and I feel like i've found the perfect major for me because it basically combines economics, sociology, history, anthropology, politics, geography, and philosophy into one field so I get to learn about so many various subjects! That's just my personal experience with International Relations, best of luck in your search for a direction!  The book a mind for numbers would be a good start. Or take the course learning how to learn on cousera. It'll teach you how to store and manipulate information at a deep level. 
 It much depends on what you want the outcome to be. I think you have to decide on that first.

After having to deal with heavy ADHD, slowely transitioned into ADD, on my own for about 18-19 years before getting help, I'd definitely recommend trying to break down and analyze your core thought patterns when it comes to thirst for learning. I had this same "problem" however it also extended into learning actions. I would never fully master things, but I would always get on the brink of above average and then move on. While you say you're average I'm sure you're above average intellegence or in terms of knowledge at least, by now. Without sounding like a cocky lil shit, I have the same thing where I just have an abnormally big amount of skillsets and or muscle memory, but I'm realistically never gonna use all of them ever again. While its fun in the process as I grew up, just jumping on new things and learning them, soaking them up, the knowledge. I eventually got frustrated of not having anything mastered. Jack of all trades but master of none.

To go back to the original point, I'd suggest to try to analyse yourself in how and why it is that you pick a certain subject to learn. Wether its accesability, relatability, usage etc. Also find out how you teach yourself stuff and whats the fun part, is it the info you're learning, or is it just that you find satisfaction in the fact that you're learning something, whatever it may be. 

Overall if you find these habits of your weird or ADHD related, I really would recommend keeping a notebook to write down random thoughts that you have through out your day and consistently analyse your thoughts as well. After having grown up with pretty severe ADHD without any help, the thing that made it the most lightweight was easily being analytical of my thought and behaviour process and ADHD impulses. The more patterns you find the more you can help speed up thoughts and make more sense of actions. This also makes it easier to "fix" things you don't like. Though I'm not sure how long this actually takes to do, since I've done it first subconciously and then conciously since I was little (due to parent). But you seem like a intelligent person so I'm sure you'd do this much faster than I did.  

But it sounds similar to my case, and others I know as well, where you're almost addicted to that feeling of grasping a new concept. In terms of retaining infromation and pulling it together from different sources, what worked for me when I was pretty into biology/physics, was to attatch information to other pieces of information or simply refrences. Almost like memory triggers. If a certain word in a line gave me a random thought, I would use that random thought as a connection or trigger. That would mean next time I hear or think of either, the connected one would appear in my thought as well. You could literally connect anything you see fit, techniques like this are very subjective in execution. I connected the word "Coconut" to the technique the greenBasilisk use to run on water, simply because the book had a coconut on the page before. There's a ton of memorizing techniques like that, that are really good for people with ADHD and can help speed up the collecting of thoughts. The hard part is just finding which one works for you. I think my friend has the ooolest but the most bizzare one where he can picture in his head, an entire bookshelf and place desired information into it which he can pick out pieces of info at will as though they are bookmarked... Though he's also a billion times smarter than me so that could be why as well. Sorry for derailing so much, ironically... But to reiterate the point, use techniques within self analytics and memorizing techniques, the reason why you do things, will often help you to improve on how you want to do it. And the less your brain has to focus on perfectly memorizing desired information or pulling together multiple concepts at once from your abyss of knowledge, the easier it tends to get over time. You'll find in general that the more you can lessen the workload memory off small tasks, the easier it gets to remember the important info.

Take what you want from this wall, it is some of the analytics I've subjectively made while growing up and now cooperating them with my professional help, who seems to agree with most of it. So take it with a grain of salt and keep in mind that you might have to optimize some of it to fit your own prefrences better.

TL;DR The less you know about the engine of your train of knowledge-thirst, the harder it is to set it on your preferred path.  Preaching.
I'm a History/Classical Civilization majors but I dabble in geology, astronomy, archaeology, folklore/mythology, and occult studies.~~I blame Sailor Moon~~

In my last year of college and still looking for a career that'll let me learn and read a lot but not necessarily write papers for it. 

Looking into Library or Museum studies at the moment.   Gonna have to figure out where I fall and read up on those tips! Thank you! Hey maybe someday you'll end up in sales as well!  Okay that is 100% me. I see from the link that you've posted, only a description of the type of the person you are, it does not speak about what to do about the same. More light on that topic will be highly appreciated :)
 The consulting sounds like it may fit best to provide a stable income, constant change, and reduced medication. 

If I was able to make a good living from it my path would be hiking/backpacking and selling the photography. Constant change, constantly on the move, running a personal business, plenty of time to read and continue learning, etc. I'm not particularly good at language or writing. However, I would love to dabble in photo journalism.  I've actually already purchased a mind for numbers but have no started it yet. I'll move it forward on my list.  There's really no telling with types like us! ha ha!

I just thought of something...

If you become interested in a topic, why not search university websites for a syllabus pertaining to the subject? Most of the time, those aren't secured information, and it gives you a path to follow to learn more about the topic. That info came from a different report after I got the results, but it's supposedly customized based on your scores for each of your top 5 strengths.

If you can afford to take the test, that'll give you the best results (for instance, I was convinced I'd be analytical as my #1, but it was a distant #5...)

Otherwise, I'll see if I can dig it up tonight and share some of those details :) that is a fantastic idea! Thank you!
