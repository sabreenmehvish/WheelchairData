Any advice for staying focused when reading? Hello r/ADHD. I'm new here, 22M in 5th year of University. I am thoroughly convinced that I have some form of ADHD. I did not really notice a lot of things in the past, but my significant other noticed a lot of behaviours and patterns that would be visible in someone with ADHD. I'm waiting on my medicare card to arrive in the mail to see a doctor.

I am a smart student and have a good work ethic and try to get things done asap. I get at least 80's in all my classes and am in the top of my class.

My issue is that I have a hard time focusing on tasks, especially reading. The only way that I get all of my work done is by setting aside LARGE amounts of time in my day to make sure I get all of my work done. As a result I have very little time for friends and any other hobbies so it has become extremely frustrating and makes me extremely anxious.

TLDR: I have trouble focusing on reading stuff for school. How do I stay focused? Put on some headphones and find some instrumental music that fits the theme of what you're reading, or if it's textbooks, listen to any instrumental music that you enjoy. Here's what I do to get reading done. (I'm a college student too.)

1. Go to the library and find a secluded desk, preferably one with three little walls around the edge of it so it blocks most of the view. You may not have these kinds of desks so maybe try finding one where you are facing a wall. If you like having external stimuli, sit by a window. Avoid being near other people because you can get drawn into listening to conversations.

2. Plug in headphones into an mp3 player, laptop, or phone to listen to music. Put on classical or other calm, soothing music without lyrics. Lyrics tend to distract me.

3. If using a laptop, make sure all web browsers, video games, etc. are closed. 

4. Set a timer for 10-20 minutes. Whatever you think you can handle. 

5. Read for this set amount of time. When the timer goes off, take 5-10 minutes to do whatever you want. Walk around the library, look at a magazine, text friends,  check facebook or reddit. 

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you've completed all your assigned reading or until you feel too burned out that you aren't reading efficiently anymore. If the latter, take a longer break by leaving the library and going for a long walk. If possible, go back to the reading much later in the day or finish it the next day.

The timer is your master. When it goes off, you HAVE to switch gears. No "let me check one more thing on reddit." We all know "one more thing" isn't really just one more thing. 

EDIT: one other thing I just remembered that you could try, when you open your text book, lay down an m&m or gummy bear or any other small piece of candy or snack you like on each paragraph. As you read the paragraph, you get to eat the candy. It's a much more immediate visual way to show how you're progressing through your work and to reward yourself.  I put on headphones and listen to music when I read.  Download some white noise mp3 files and play those while you read.  That helps me focus tremendously.
 If what you are reading is well known such as literature, go to youtube and find the audiobook. Read along with it and let the audiobook effortlessly guide you to the end. An added bonus is that you will remember more of it, as you are using two different senses to take it in, as opposed to just one with reading. Am I the only one who gets distracted as all Hell by background music? Maybe it's because I'm a musician, but if music is competing with a task I'm trying to do, my brain starts analyzing the music as I lose my train of thought every five minutes.  Sometimes I put both of my hands flat on the table except for when I'm turning pages **Read interactively.**  

When you read, always have a (potentially even colored) pencil in hand.  Some highlighters and post it notes/flags would be good, too.  Mark the shit out of your book.  

Here are some things you can mark:   

* words you don't know  
* passages you don't understand  
* phrases you particularly like the sound of, or like what they are saying  
* parts you think might be important  
* parts you hate or disagree with  
* your comments on the material, the characters, the action, the author (like "what a fucking idiot!")   
* things that remind you of other things in your life - note the other things - movies, song lyrics, people, events in your life.   
* Questions you have, even if you suspect they will be answered in the next paragraph  
* predictions you have about what is going to happen next  

Dog ear pages. Attach notes. You can merely underline things, or circle them or highlight them.  I write tons of brackets and arrows and frowny faces and stuff like that.  I also do huge angry exclamation points.  You should write your questions/comments, etc. in the margins and between paragraphs.   

**WHY**  

* This interactivity lets your hands do something, which often helps with people with ADHD focus more - I think it has something to do with reaching a stimulation threshold or something.   
* It will absolutely help you remember the material once you HAVE read it, because you will be forging further connections in your brain.    
*  I have found that the benefit of reading like this is that it allows me to integrate all the things that might normally be distracting me into the reading process ("That's just like Darth Vader!" goes into the book instead of my brain going down the Star Wars rabbit hole).   
*  I don't get tripped up, and hence sidetracked, by things I don't understand. I just highlight it/note it/mark it up and deal with it or allow myself to come back to it later and move on.   
*  Have a dictionary/smart phone with you so you can briefly note definitions.    

ETA: formatting Listening to white noise on repeat while reading helps. Some people will charge you for it but there are others who won't Actively underline important things. I am on medication, but it still isn't enough most of the time for extended periods of reading. The only thing I have really found to help is mixing exercise in with my reading. Every twenty minutes of reading, I will go for a ten minute jog. It's not the perfect solution, but I have found it the most effective for getting my work done. This.
I recently started to listen to instrumental music while studying. Has definitely helped. I should get better headphones so I can listen for long periods. I cannot listen to any sort of music while studying. I find it to be extremely distracting. However, I have found that listening to white noise while I study helps keep away some distractions. this has helped significantly, thanks! :) The timer thing definitely helps. Also, exercise! I know this is common advice but make sure it is some form of aerobic exercise, such as cycling. Try doing this for half an hour to an hour every other day. You should gradually notice your ability to stay reading increase. Definitely have been giving the timer a try, thanks for the tips! :) I honestly would but usually it takes so much longer to read/listen to an audiobook, plus I still just zone out while they're talking and will have to rewind. [removed] Yes! The gummy bear/m&m idea especially! I LOVE that method (I am chocolate motivated) I will save up to buy those headphones. Thank you very much. I'm saving up for some audio technica's right now! :)
