School, work and just trying to straighten yourself out in general? Any advice would be helpful... This post might end up a little long, sorry for the blocks of texts!

**General background and family:**

After years of bad habits and constantly being late and needing more time for things, I came to the understanding that I most likely like had adhd-PI after a long time friend who was diagnosed with it, suggested it to me... After much research and having a kind of mental breakdown last year before I graduated, I had get help. I told my doc how I was feeling and went a bunch of different kinds of anti-depressants/anxiety medications until I narrowed down the problem to attention or potentially something else after failing to do a summer course after graduation.... Went to a psych and realized I wasn't depressed(it was situational/environmental), but that I may have problems with attention and anxiety(I know I'm anxious lol) So then my doc prescribed me wellbutrin first too see if it would help, but I didn't really feel a difference... Eventually we tried adderall, and it kinda worked, but sometimes I got weird symptoms(drank orange juice one time and felt off or I just felt a little off at times?) Finally, we tried vyvanse and I felt pretty darn great(but I hate not having an appetite or feeling mad thirsty), so I currently have that now, but I'm not consistent with it...

I'm pretty sure my whole family has it...(Adhd for brother, sister and Dad, and Add for mom and me) My brother was prescribed ritalin when he was younger, but my parents didn't keep up with it at the time nor did they provide the structure and routine that was necessary to have along with medication, so he currently just lives an aimless lifestyle with no planning whatsoever. My dad can't ever stay still and has a lot of issues with impulse control, even though he's more organized and has a routine with his job. But any disruption to it will freak him out. Mom is never on time and is very absent minded, never really paying attention when you talk to her. I'm mostly like that too.

**School:**

After thinking about my education over the years, I realized I always had a problem with finishing things on time or organizing myself when the work required more effort than what was presented in class. This really didn't become a big problem until high school, when I needed to read textbooks more, but sometimes I'd forget assignments and if the teacher was more lax and not scary, you could get away with this. Lots of times I'd be doodling in class or trying not to nod off(I try my best to pay attention, but sometimes I just get sleepy?) I'd also be staying up late often or doing big papers the night before. I could never finish my tests on time and even didn't finish all my sections on the SAT, but was able to do well enough. I was able to get by with these habits and have B-ish grades but once I went to college, it all came falling apart.

In college I had  more and more trouble getting to school on time(Your parents don't take you anymore...I'd have to commute by train, car or bus at times; about an hr away) Math was a struggle because you have to constantly practice problems. I was a bio major and around half way through, I literally couldn't read textbooks in a timely fashion. sometimes, it'd literally take an hr to get through 2-3 pgs... The power pts were most helpful for me but this caused suffering in the long term. Slowly I'd be writing my papers the morning of they were due. I was bad at proof reading. My doodlings on the margins of notebooks also filled the sides. I'd have grades that were just inconsistent and mostly low Bish to C-ish again, just getting by...

This got so bad that around my last year I started missing assignments for some classes, would skip a class due to immense anxiety from not having work done and being late or just getting depressed and reclusive. I almost dropped out during my final semester because I literally felt as if I couldn't function anymore, but I stuck through but finished very poorly. I'm thankful that my teachers were so kind and would be easy on me, since I would never miss a day or would always go to office hrs, but this was not the way to go, especially with how things turned out my final semester.  

**Employment:**

Sometimes it feels as if I can't do simple things? I'd wind up aiming lower with my employment and doing things that required the bare minimum, then feel frustrated because I was underachieving... But when I'd have retail jobs such as cashier, I feel like I'd have trouble with doing multiple step processes(having to talk on the intercom, forgetting steps later, always having to ask for help, etc) I'd mainly struggle with finishing on time, or forgetting small steps. I recently got another job at a medical office, and when I'd mention potentially having trouble just memorizing steps, they'd say it's so easy, even a high-schooler can do it...(So it's concerning because I feel like I should be getting these things quickly, but I'm not) 

**Social:**

It takes me a long time to gather my thoughts when asked something on the spot, and other times I can often be a little air headed or ditsy. I often have the appearance of someone being put together or sounding knowledgeable, but it feels like I overcompensated for feeling exactly the opposite inside. Others also comment on me looking spaced out and honestly I have to remind myself to focus during a conversation and not let my thoughts go off track. I'm also directionally challenged(always need a gps) and can't seem to remember names most of the time(I also forget to introduce myself often).

**Current:**

Currently, I'm trying to work on myself, time time management and have better habits, and more structure/routine. I wanted to continue with grad school, but all the junk last year and my bad panic attacks from being in a school setting have been put on delay. I definitely intend to go back, but It's really hard for me to read the textbooks(like 2 pgs per hr) and study effectively. I want to be consistent and stop falling back into the forgetful habits. I recently watched a video by Jim Rohn that changed my mindset and thinking  and brought several other books to read, but I'm tired of feeling so caught up in the lost time or regretting how things turned out vs what I initially had planned. I'm like a baby trying to start all my learning and growth over again lol

**Has anyone gone through anything similar?** I don't have the money to get a full evaluation by a professional at this time, and I don't know what information or resources they'd give me, but I do want to go back to school and become more independent, and I know it takes time, but **is there anything tips or tricks you guys did to help with thriving in school and learning new skills and work in a way that fits someone with low attentiveness?** I'm tired of feeling "dumb", disappointed, regretful or frustrated most of the time.

**Note**: I do better with my medication, but I don't like the feeling of lack of appetite and dehydration to do it all the time. Each time I was supposed to go back to doc for a follow up with my medication, I'd forget and wasn't taking the medication consistently enough for us to really evaluate anything lol
