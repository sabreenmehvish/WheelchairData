I've recently become aware of the fact that I chose the wrong career. Originally, I wanted to vent to you all, but then I saw this article and it misses the point so hard that now all I want to do is rant about this shit. http://www.additudemag.com/slideshow/114/slide-1.html

This entire article is full of pop-culture misconceptions about ADHD. From reading this, you'd think it was some kind of superpower that makes you able to work in fast-paced, distraction-filled environments. Now, maybe it's just me, but that sounds like the *opposite* of where someone with ADHD would feel at home....right? My therapist told me I have one of the most clear-cut cases of ADHD he's seen (and he's a fairly old guy, so I assume he's been practicing a while), so I don't think it's just me...

Let's start from the top:

>"We think on our feet, we're creative problem-solvers, and we multitask like crazy!" 8 dream jobs that harness the innate skills and strengths of ADHD minds.

This is literally the opposite of me. I do not think on my feet. I do not multitask well at all. My current job is IT help desk. I feel stuck in this as I went to college for it (after fucking up for most of a decade and wasting money and time in the process, but that's another story), and the hardest part of my job is the fact that I'm called on to solve very challenging problems 8 to 5 every day. I could understand how some people might like that. For me it's torture, and realizing how misplaced I am in this field at this late stage in the game is depressing as hell.

Multitask like crazy my ass. Tell that to the poor accountant who didn't get her email fixed because I got a much lower priority ticket that got me distracted and all I can tell her is "oops" in so many words.

>Teacher
Many ADHD adults find joy in professions that allow them to work directly with children—in careers such as teaching or child care. These jobs rely on your sparkling ADHD personality and thoughtful creativity, and they'll put your patience to the test. To be successful in a kid-focused career, you’ll need to be able to think on your feet and transition from task-to-task quickly—because when you’re working with kids, anything can happen!

So I have a little niece, right? I love her to death, don't get me wrong, but I basically have to allow myself the freedom to completely lose all ability to control my window of attention when I'm around her. When I'm around her is literally the time when my ADHD is at its worst.

And there goes the "thinking on your feet" thing again. Who the hell wrote this? Switching from task-to-task quickly? God I wish. What is this superpower?

>Daycare Worker
“I love working with toddlers and preschoolers—they understand me! We jump from one project to the next and they rarely know when I’m off task.” – Lori, an ADDitude reader

See above. 'Nuff said.

>Journalist
ADHD adults working in journalism find the work exciting, creative, and rewarding. Journalists need to deal well with day-to-day changes in work setting, covering a broad range of topics, interacting with a variety of people, and having a quick turnaround on assignments – all a good fit for a person with loads of energy, a short attention span, low boredom threshold, and problems with sustained focus over hours or days. Hard deadlines, however, may be a challenge for ADHD adults. 

They fucking literally just got through saying ADHD people would be good with "quick turnaround on assignments" and then they end the paragraph by saying "hard deadlines may be a challenge". Christ. It's like the authors mental image of someone with ADHD is some hyperactive office worker squirrel.

>Copy Editor
“My best job was in a busy newsroom as a copy editor. There was constant activity and fast deadlines. If I had 15 things to focus on at once, I was golden!” 
— Patti, an ADDitude reader

Oh fuck no.

Skipping a few here because they're not so bad. Just a bit more "Wow! So good at switching from task to task OMG!" etc

>Emergency First-Responders
EMTs, police officers, and firefighters must work well under pressure and be able to make split-second decisions. These jobs allow you to work in a variety of settings, while providing the kind of adrenaline-pumping excitement that helps many ADHDers focus their minds. When others start to panic in chaos, the ADHD brain kicks into high gear allowing you to see problems clearly and complete the task at hand.

Again, are we talking about ADHD or some Marvel movie superpower here? Is this like spidey-sense? Or is it like the Force or something? Maybe I don't have ADHD at all. Maybe I'm just stupid or lazy or something. Because I sure don't experience any of this stuff.

>High-Tech Field
An ADHD brain is a perfect match for high-tech jobs because an under-stimulated frontal lobe gets jump-started from an over-stimulated virtual environment. Computer technicians rove throughout a company working with others to solve computer problems, while software developers generally work independently — creating and troubleshooting computer code for programs, websites, or apps. Both jobs provide ample opportunity to problem solve and harness that ADHD hyperfocus on small details.

Oh fuck right off. What the fuck is an "over-stimulated virtual environment"? I look at a gray screen with bland text displaying a list of active tickets. Sometimes I jump in Active Directory and click on trees of network objects. It's just bland, dull Windows UI objects. It's one of the least "stimulating" environments I've ever dealt with.

"Computer technicians rove throughout a company working with others to solve computer problems..." Ah yes, me the computer technician, "roving" about the building, holding a magnifying glass like Sherlock fucking Holmes, solving everyone's computer mysteries. How do I do it? I have the AMAZING POWER OF BARELY POSESSING ANY EXECUTIVE FUNCTION! I ran into a car one time because I simply forgot there was a stoplight at an intersection. God I'm so amazing. haha I love having ADHD. SQUIRREL! xD

>Software Developer
“Most software tasks only take a few weeks which helps prevent monotony. As a software developer, the problems I deal with are diverse, interesting, and require constant hands on thinking—great for keeping the ADHD mind on track.” 
– Adam, an ADDitude reader

My desk is ten feet away from software developers. All they do all day is sit in perfect silence and look at code. I've tried programming as a hobby when I was a teenager and I had some fun playing around, but doing that 8 hours a day would be almost the same as putting me in solitary confinement. Fuck that. I like the product engineering folks, but I couldn't do what they do.

>The Arts
It's no secret that ADHDers are some of the most creative people around, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that ADHD adults succeed when surrounded by other artists. Working in a fast-paced, artistic environment is ideal for ADHD adults who thrive in creative chaos. Whether it's as a TV producer, choreographer, or concert pianist, ADHDers are happiest when their work allows them to express their artistic abilities. After all, "There's no business like show business!"

First off, I feel like some artistic endeavors could actually work for the ADHD brain, but Jesus Christ, lay off the fucking "chaos" thing. Let me spell it out for you: **I. CANNOT. WORK. WITHOUT. STRUCTURE.** What's this "chaos" shit?

Sorry for the rant. I'm dealing with some shit now. It took me [several] years to graduate from a two year college. The whole time, the evidence kept piling up that IT was the wrong choice for me, but I felt like after I'd already sunk so much time and effort into it, I had to have something to show for it (protip: never **ever** think this way about anything). Well, here I am. In debt and struggling in a mismatched career. I must be a good actor or something, because I seem to have convinced my boss and my company's HR staff at my interview that I can do the tasks required of me, but they're starting to see through it. My boss is extremely unforgiving and he does not make it any easier.

The thing is, I've never been more motivated to work in my life. My workplace is amazing. I love the people, I love the environment, I love being there. But the evidence just keeps stacking up as every day I make mistake after mistake. I actually planned today to be an experiment.  I slept well last night. I was medicated, I got some espresso on the way to work. And then around 9:30 or so, I fucking forgot an entire step in the PC re-imaging procedure and assed up some shit in Active Directory. My boss was so mad he just left the area.

Even if I bring my 100% to work like I did today, it's still not enough. Everyone says "you just need to try harder". Fuck that shit sideways! GodDAMN it, all I ever *do* is try. All these difficulties and they're sure as hell not for lack of trying. Eight to five every day. Try try try. But guess what? No one pays you for trying.

So I've seen the writing on the wall. I wasted several years pursuing the wrong career and now it's time to get out. But fucking hell, what do I do? I need medical insurance. I need to keep the lights on! I feel like I'm on borrowed time until I fuck up so bad I get fired. But in the meantime, I have no other marketable skills and nothing lined up to pay the bills. I'm not in a financial situation where I can make less than I do now. Fuck my life. I agree, the whole SUPER MULTI-TASKING ZOOMIE GENIUS doesn't at all reflect what I've experienced. Multi-tasking makes me break down and want to cry because I get overwhelmed and the information mixes together and I make mistakes and it sucks.

Just because you see me quickly switching tasks and flinging papers everywhere doesn't mean I'm getting stuff done. Get a job leading tours, working outside, working with people like peace corps. I think adhd is a condition but we are all individuals. These careers might work for people who are drawn to these fields. Sound like you'd do better on an environment without lots of interruptions with clear cut deliverables. I enjoyed your rant 😊 I'm part of the creative choas group - I have to force myself to be organized or in a matter of hours, I'll be a completely disorganized mess.  If I want to finish tasks, I have to set up goals for me to get those grueling tasks done.  I'm in the same boat, I've tried coming to work 100% but I fuck up and my boss isn't too forgiving either. I'm also on borrowed time, or at least it feels like it. I went to college, flunked out and now i've been stuck in a retail job for the past 5 years which i'm working 12-13 hour days, 55-60 hours a week. Make decent money but I hate it and want to get out.  One of the jobs I loved was being a museum educator.  Once I figured out the structure, the content of the programs, and learned how to keep track of the time, it was an awesome job.  I had off days, but I made sure to fix my big issues.  I loved it.  Every program was the same, but different.  If we got sidetracked into something they were interested in?  I could compensate.

But would I want to be a teacher full-time?  Noooooo. * **Journalism** I took journalism for two years in high school. I felt like shit when my teacher said I was a good writer but that he couldn't rely on me enough to make me an editor that second year. I now respect his decision more than ever so LOL at that option

* **your comment about STRUCTURE** OH DEAR HEAVENS, THIS SO MUCH. I lol'd because that's exactly 100% me. Exactly.

Calling us "excellent multitaskers" is so damn misleading. Yeah, I can switch from one task to another in a split second, but the issue is that I have absolutely no control over whatever the second task is. It's fucking hell.

It's not like I can clean the house, while studying, while writing a paper, while watching Netflix and while entertaining guests. It's more like I try to clean the house, then start fixing the lights, then start looking up stuff about exotic birds... and then at the end of the day, nothing got done. Same here! Only mutlitask because as a mom it's necessary.  But my dream would be being able to 100% focus on something for several hours.  One of the things I *do* enjoy about my job is people. I never expected I'd be like that. But all the positive feedback I've gotten has been to the effect of "We like that he's a people person.", which shocks me as a former self-described introvert.

Working outside? I would have said "fuck no" before trying IT, but now? God yes. Get me out of these fucking cubicles. I don't care if the heat index is 115. I want out.

Honestly, the tour guide thing sounds kind of interesting. I might be able to leverage the customer service experience I have towards that, and people have told me I'm a good explainer especially if I'm enthusiastic about something. Something to look into if I can find something locally. Thanks for the idea! BTW there's an increasing need for systems experts in health care IT.   For example our state has been working for years on a health information  exchange and I bet that field could use people looking for a change in routine from the hell of IT help tickets... >These careers might work for people who are drawn to these fields.

Exactly this.  
Passion is the key.U should like ur work enough to get addicted to it....
