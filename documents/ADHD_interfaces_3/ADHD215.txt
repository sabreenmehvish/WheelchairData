I forgot to text her back and it's been hours. Am I the only one who forgets to text back dates? I swear, this is the reason why I am single. I can't follow-up because I forget or I get super anxious about making the right move. I didn't take my meds because I needed some sleep, but now I forget to text back someone I want to get to know better for hours. 

The messed up part was I had a reply ready and never hit sent. How common is it among people with ADHD to do this?  I forget to text people back all the time, and I often feel bad about it, as I hate it when people do not respond to my texts. I usually forget for a few hours, then worry if it is too late to send it, and then its two days later and I've completely ghosted them. I wish I could just tell everyone I know to call me instead of texting. Honestly this generation sucks balls.

Humans aren’t meant to have access to each other 24/7. Or at least I don’t think we are....

But maybe this is also stems from my inability to follow social norms.

Next time a potential SO asks why you didn’t reply, simply explain that you’re rebelling against society and that it’s actually a romantic gesture in disguise.

Hah 
 just text her back now, say you got distracted and when she responds, chat with her a bit. no biggie, you've got this. I don't have a great answer, since I've been predominantly single af, and am in my 30s. But, my general philosophy is: Yes. I need to set reminders and make an effort to be communicative with ~~a new person~~ people. On the other hand...this is who I am. If that's a turn-off for them, better they learn sooner rather than later. I also make sure all new people know that I am not a fantastic texter, but I do try. If I don’t text back right away then it’s really a toss up whether I respond really late or at all. Depending on the conversation, I usually just throw in a ‘sorry for the late reply’ or ‘omg, I completely forgot to reply! Sorry!’ (if it’s been longer than a few days) and pick up where the convo was. 

As adults in 2018, 99% of us have the attention span of a 10min YouTube video or less.* I find mentioning you forgot to reply and being genuine about it, most people will know that feel and won’t hold a grudge. However, people can only take so much if it’s constantly happening. 

*completely unscientific data that I made up but it seems kinda true, doesn’t it? This is the story of my life. I hate when people act like I’m a bad friend... Texting is great for quick q’s but I hate having a whole convo through it Good luck OP! And remember, if someone can’t cut you slack (after you’ve explained yourself) then keep in mind what that person would be like in other scenarios where your humanity shows and you fall short on things. 

😌 I always do that, I just tell them exactly what happened I fish I had a dollar for every text that started with “sorry this is so late.” Don’t get hung up on it, text them back... and keep us updated! Ugh. I feel you. I either forget to text back because I get distracted .. or I think I've texted back, only to find out I actually didn't anywhere from hours to days later .. because I've only replied in my mind without actually typing out the response and sending it. This is how I let all my friendships wither away. Now I just tell new friends “I’m bad at texting. Feel free to text - I will always read them, but I may never respond.” I have found people to be very understanding! I have a new friend who texts me all the time and never cares when I don’t respond because I opened with that caveat. HAHAHAHA I’m gonna try this
