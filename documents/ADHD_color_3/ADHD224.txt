An Ode To My Meds * Your color is bright blue
* I can't believe the person I've turned into
* I am no longer the ditzy ingenue


* Before you
* I made all these plans to better myself; they fell through
* I was folded inwards, you helped me bloom
* I'm not a deer in headlights, without a clue
* & I am no longer so blue


* You unraveled thought loops that were untrue
* And on them I no longer stew
* I know I'm the only one I need to live up to
* The confidence boost was long overdue

* You helped me see my real IQ
* The bell curve on tests I will no longer skew
* My memory isn't like doggy doo
* My thoughts are not like soggy bathroom tissue
* Now I have energy too

* But my confidence doesn't come from you
* It was in there already, it just grew
* The person I am, I now value. 
* You could say you changed my whole world view.


* Now I can live the life I want to pursue
* Instead of the old me I was used to 
* Life is easier to get through
* When I can do the things I want to do
 I'm nearing one week on Vyvanse and I can honestly say it has changed my life. It sounds like you’re euphoric/hypomanic. I hate to be that guy, but in all likelihood, those effects (confidence, energy, motivation) won’t last long. Amphetamine is the best thing ever synthesized. Does Vyvanse cause you too lose your appetite? When I was on vyvanse I dropped 10 pounds and was physically repulsed by the idea of eating lunch. Same! It’ll be a week on Wednesday. I’m on a super low dose but I feel like my quality of life has improved by like 150%.  I switched from Adderall to Vyvanse about a year ago. At the time I couldn't really tell any drastic differences other than it lasted a bit longer than Adderall. Somedays I can't even tell if it works at all.

But one thing is for sure. The days I forget to take it are brutal. When I'm back to "normal" mode, my mind feels..."heavy"? As if I have a million things to do and I don't feel like doing a single thing. All I want to do is sit and do nothing. My anxiety starts kicking in at work because I'm supposed to be...well...working. And I simply can't muster up the mental strength to do it.

So yeah, meds are a lifesaver. I don't want to go back to the life I was living without them. Your point is valid and it might be the case for OP, but I wouldn't deny the power of being functional after a lifetime of failing. It can definitely boost confidence and help creating and maintaining good habits, which in turn will increase energy and motivation.  Oh my god yes. Today I skipped breakfast, ate a small salad for lunch and had an avocado for dinner. Tons of water though. I’m already on a diet, but this turned my normal 2 pounds a week into overdrive. I am not exactly happy about it though, because I know it’s not healthy.  I get really bad stomach aches of I skip good or start to feel anxious
