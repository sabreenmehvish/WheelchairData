Help! Learning lines My distracted kid is the lead in the sixth grade play. He says he knows everyone else's lines, but forgets his own. 

I can't give him any advice because my own speciality is forgetting words and missing cues. I never managed to do drama.

Please. What are ways to help him learning lines? Have him write them all down by hand. It helps to reinforce the memory if it is in more than one place in your brain.  Make them engaging and/or entertaining.  At least for me the more something is an obligation and the less that it engages or interests me the less likely it is to get done. Try setting them to music/turning them into a song? Or, if he knows everyone else's lines, maybe he can try using the ends of other peoples' lines to help prompt his memory with the beginning of his own lines. I was a HUGE drama nerd theater geek in high school- and I struggle ALOT with my ADHD lol- what I would do when I was memorizing lines, is first I'd break the script up into smaller sections and focus on only one bit at a time. I'd use different colored highlighters to color code each of the sections, so let's say I had to memorize a 5 minute monologue, each paragraph or so gets different color highlighted. 

So for example the first part would be green, and I'd spend my time working only on fully memorizing and performing the green lines. Once I felt confident enough that I could remember the green section, I'd tackle the next paragraph that's in yellow highlighter, and only focus on the yellow section, get to where I can memorize and perform just the yellow section from memory and then I'd go back and attempt again to 'perform' the green section from memory to make sure I still remembered it and then keep going through till the end of the yellow section which is still fresh on my mind from learning it that day. Then wash rinse repeat the process so on and so on. Sec3 is blue-learn to do the blue section on its own, then add it on the green, yellow, and blue. When I'd be in thespian competitions or on stage in a play, i was able to remember the entire piece by being able to associate the memory with the colors and keep the lines in the right order by remembering the visual "okay i so the order goes green, yellow, blue, orange, purple, then pink is the end" and it helps me keep my mind organized and focused so that I don't let my severe ADHD let me forget a part or mix up the order or lose my train of thought etc.  Thanks! 

This advice is gold and I will get him to remember you all with silver Livescribes when he takes Hollywood. ---

[Click me to opt out!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=alotabot&subject=ignore+me&message=ignore+me) Also, if he's been bringing his script home to memorize lines, it could help to read the lines out loud with him so he can get a feel for the script and more practice physically speaking the words and being engaged with another person to read the other characters lines to him helps keep attention and engagement. Have him not just read the lines but work on acting them too when he's reading. If he's supposed to walk from one side of the stage to the other while he says a particular line  actually have him walk across the living room or wherever you are as he's supposed to in rehearsal/onstage (if they haven't got that far yet on rehearsal then encourage him to be creative with it and make movements, gestures, tone shifts, inflections, facial expressions, etc that he would feel would be natural for the context of the line and the scene. Kinesthetic learning is phenomenal I find for working with my ADHD; it helps to have physical actions to reinforce the memory of what's being learned. 

There's essentially 3 main learning methods in educational teaching methods; some kids are visual learners, they do best by reading material, utilizing images, diagrams etc. there's some who are most auditory learners. The learn best by hearing something explained/recited/verbalized out loud. The 3rd category is kinesthetic which is the kids who learn best by doing things hangs on, physically engaging with the subject as it's being taught/learned. 
For me, my ADHD requires me to utilize all three to fully do my best. 

-The suggestions above cover all 3- color coded notes:visual

-Practing reading/performing lines out loud with a partner: auditory 

-not just reciting lines while memorizing but physically acting it out as you practice memorizing it: kinesthetic 

Triple reinforcement!
