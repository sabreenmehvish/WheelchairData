Colored pens Anyone else here feel better when they're writing with brightly colored pens? I actually hate writing with pens because my handwriting was separated at birth from it's twin, indiscriminate scribbling, but I tend to use them at work. I find myself using red pens exclusively. For whatever reason, it makes me more likely to write things down and more likely to read them afterwards. 

Any of this sound familiar to anyone? I got into fountain pens a little bit ago and I had a ton of fun trying out a bunch of sample inks.  I've got three pens and I've settled on the following inks:

- [Diamine Eclipse](http://www.gouletpens.com/d7081/p/D7081) - A super dark purple.
- [De Atramentis Sepia Brown](http://www.gouletpens.com/da1018/p/da1018) - A redish brown ink, currently my favorite.
- [Noodler's Navy](http://www.gouletpens.com/n19038/p/N19038) - A nice strong blue (normally I hate blue inks).

I've also got different width nibs on each pen (easy to swap between pens too), so I can get line variation and ink variation very easily.

It's a lot of fun and now I write a **lot** more than I ever used to.  

I'm trying to keep an eye out for brighter (but not blindingly so) purple inks.  I also had a neat green sample and a really cool _grey_ sample ink! [20 pack of different colors](http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Premium-Assorted-31294/dp/B001K9Z4II/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1431027656&sr=8-4&keywords=pens+20+color) and Moleskin makes me smile.  I prefer the non normal pen colors like purple, green, pink, and orange.

And yes it makes it more interesting and more likely that I will engage with it. I oftentimes use them to keep be working on the task in front of me. Studying is better with color! I write my notes in various colors, but mainly I use the ones that tend to be brighter, like reds, pinks, teams, and purples because it helps me to remember what I'm taking notes on, especially if I alternate colors fairly often. I use red pen exclusively for math notes because it's such an in your face color for big pages of text that it helps me remember all the formulas and whatnot.  I love pens. I wish so badly that pilot made a .5 G2 refill in green. I use blue out of desperation.  I credit my good grades in my upper level biology to rainbow pens. My notes were gorgeous (minus all the horrible handwriting). 

I have kept an entire pencil bag of various colored and width writing utensils with me at all times for years. 

I am also a fan of grid paper, .however the grid cannot be too dark. Also, I dislike the green engineering tablets-- the grey/white are much better.  I also use fountain pens...I have three that I use for work; all loaded with bright inks.  I like the different colors when I take notes...keeps things from getting monotonous/monochrome.  (ha!) And the fountain pens help my handwriting achieve at least semi-legibility  I play with pencils and pens a lot. Got busy hands.  Nothing feels better than a yellow ticonderoga.  I use red, green, blue, and black pens to write thing in order of relevance.  >separated at birth from it's twin

LMAO 

I definitely notice this sort of mood change depending on the color pens/markers I use. For some reason pink and orange have been the winning colors for tasks, black for logging. In another browser window, I am seriously considering dropping $60 on a kickstarter for a glass-nib fountain pen that can supposedly write with pretty much any liquid.

I'm not sure where I'd ever use it. Not likely to be portable for class notes, and I wouldn't want it around the 6th graders in school. I use sharpie pens exclusively, and have about 15+ different colors. I'm a programmer, and when I was going back to school it helped with paying attention. Now it's a (good) habit that I don't ever want to kick :) I love to use different colors of pens, makes things easier to separate out. Like doodling in one color/notes in another, stuff like that. When you invest in your tools you really see a return! Plus, you may otherwise feel guilty if you don't use them. :D

I agree *fun* is always a good motivator to getting shit done!

 Only three inks??  I must have at least 50 different colors.  Though I totally agree that Sepia Brown is an awesome color.   I absolutely love it!  I'm doing my best at keeping my spending in check.  Fountain pens can become a very expensive hobby very quickly. =P I only started a month or so ago... and I'm trying so hard NOT to buy a ton of pens and inks.. D: If you write pages every day, I can't imagine how many pens and ink you may go through monthly. Gotta love that old-fashioned style, though.

My basic roller ball pens simply don't cut the large scale writing projects. T_T My only writing these days is journaling and notes at work.  The journaling is the heaviest writing activity, but I've been taking more and more notes on paper at work since I got my fountain pens (for reference: I work in IT, I have two work computers, and I constantly sing the praises of OneNote for digital note-taking).  There's just.. something about the tactile sensation of writing with a pen on paper.  I feel like a fountain pen only makes it more wonderful. Classic pen and paper. I used to have terrible hand-writing and cursive that was worse. 

I didn't always like to write until I started practicing my cursive. One year later, it's become quite pretty and receives  the occasional compliment. Small things like that are what accomplishes goals as ADHD. :) Oh man, my cursive is poop.  I think my handwriting looks a lot better in the half-print kind of style I use.  I'm practicing writing more slowly so I can get consistent letter shapes down.  But yeah, small progress dude (or dudette).  It all adds up!
