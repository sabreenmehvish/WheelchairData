October is ADHD Awareness Month! How fitting is it that I'm finding out on the LAST DAY OF OCTOBER?!  

And I found this out while avoiding working on a paper for class. 

Happy Halloween, everyone! wait what  How appropriate, I was completely clueless also. It's not October for me anymore so I completely missed it :P Having the month be October but doing all the awareness stuff in November should just be how ADHD awareness month is done standard. Just to help drive the point home lol. This post is perfect, nobody remembered lmao Reading this as I focus on troubleshooting a vpn when I should be studying for a test. Ha! Ha, I didn't know either. Thats amazing. 1 November here in Australia right now! (reminds me of that time me and my friend missed the marijuana legalization rally because we got stoned at uni)

What they should really do is have November as the actual month, that would be true ADHD awareness!  I always got so much housecleaning done when I was in college.

Happy Halloween! Did you bake me a cake? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Of course it is  Better late than never... standard adhd for me!  Oh man, me too. Well, I'm heckin' aware of you now, ADHD, so watch out come November! Then I'll surely get it all done, now that I'm aware.  I just got my ADHD diagnosis on the 31st. So I guess this is my spookiest Halloween ever. Every month is ADHD Awareness month when you can never remember what month it is! How appropriate given I was hired and fired at a job this October. I knew it was Islamic heritage month and spooky month, but ADHD awareness month? Why does nobody talk about that? Oh...but where did we become aware? Surely it isn't a public thing. I did know that... but I forgot. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
 Now I have to buy a 2019 calendar so I can write in down and forget about all over again. Lmao. Perfect timing. Happy November 1st! Thanks how it is with September being bi visibility month. You're ahead of me.  I just discovered it Nov 1. Oops, missed that! Well, we would be the worst at selling our brand hah.  Damn us lol  

Could we start selling ribbons but instead of being one color that is recognizable like pink for breast cancer, it is just a whole mess of colors and is completely unorganized lol. Oh no! There's always next year! ...if any of us remember. September: ADHD Awareness Month Awareness Month Awareness Month

October: ADHD Awareness Month Awareness Month

November: ADHD Awareness Month Let's just spend the next 11 months planning out a ton of festivities and then just kinda forget about it and move on starting Oct 1. [deleted] Talk about what? I actually learned that one a few years ago, and try to remember each year!   
Wait, that means 2 awareness months in a row for me! Yes! !remindme 11 months No it's why the stove will be preheated all night long though Oh that? No, that's for your egg, milk, abd flour fetish later. Same, and I actually figured out I was bi this September. My 2nd grade teacher figured out I had ADHD though.
