Changing steps in a task can make me switch up which procedure I'm even following Some procedures have steps shared with a different procedure. I'll try to stick it in my mind which procedure I'm doing. Then I get to the shared step, and end up switching to the other procedure and going through that one. Now I've got a nervous habit of repeatedly checking which procedure I'm doing, and I still don't catch myself sometimes.

My coworkers keep asking me if I can even read. How do I explain this? Stray thoughts or conversation is enough to make me follow the wrong procedure without even realizing it, because then I'm not putting 100% focus into it. I don’t know how to explain this to your coworkers, but I totally get you on this. I really suck at any kind of workflow that requires me to manually follow a procedure—it’s just so easy to get distracted and miss something.  I'm not really sure how to explain it to your company workers, but I know I personally tend to be very visual so while words can be quite confusing things like colors and shapes are not (at least not as much). 

Something that may be helpful but would require some extra work on your part would be to assign each procedure a color or a color and a shape or something like that. Some sort of visual object that is easily matched to that procedure alone. Then when you are following the steps and get to a step that is shared with other procedures it is easier to remember what comes next because you are working on orange triangle and not purple circle. 

I hope that makes sense...

I color code EVERYTHING and people are so amazed because it *looks* very organized and clean but really it's just because I have to or else I will end up confusing the heck out of myself. Even things in my closet and my medication bottles are color coded.
