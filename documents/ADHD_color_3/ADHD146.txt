Broke down last night after getting a note from my daughter's teacher. I was diagnosed ADHD approximately 5 years ago. Since then I have realized how it affected me growing up. This isn't about me, but my daughter. 

My oldest is 9 years old, 4th grade at school. We moved this year, causing her and her sisters to change schools, which was more difficult for her. She also was put in a class with a very "hard" teacher. I went to the same elementary school growing up and this teacher was there when I went to the school, although I never had her.  I have started to notice my daughter might have ADHD earlier this year. After watching her struggle with homework and trying to stay on task with things at home, we (my bf and I) discussed it and are going to have her evaluated. We talked about it with my daughter as well and told her that I have ADHD too and if the doctor decides she does there are a lot of options we have.  Last week I gave the forms for her teacher to fill out at her parent teacher conference. She gets good grades, but she has difficulty finishing homework, classwork and talking to other kids. (shocking, right?!) 

Last night she had a note in her bag from her teacher. It stated that my daughter didn't finish her classwork on time and had to stay in from recess to do so. She also had been very talkative with the kids sitting by her. I was to sign the note and she was to take it back to the teacher. 

I just don't know what to do. I want my daughter to be responsible for her own actions, but I see so much of myself in her. When she is sitting there crying and can't explain to us why she is forgetting things, how can I not empathize? How can I be upset with her for something that might not be in her control? I don't want to make her feel worse when she can't tell me why and she doesn't know why she can't explain it. 

Do you guys have kids who are diagnosed ADHD as well? Have you chosen to use medication? Any advice would be great. I feel totally lost. She has always been a good student and this is the first time she has ever had any problems at school. I signed her note and sent one back to the teacher asking her if she had completed the screening. 

I never thought about the possibility of my children having to deal with being ADHD. I've only recently come to accept that I have it myself and am still learning. It's heartbreaking to watch her struggle. Especially when she's such a bright kid. 

Edit: Thank you all for your amazing advice! Especially u/roland00. We plan on starting the daily report cards here soon and a few other things as well. I'm currently waiting on my daughter's teacher to return her form before I have my daughter screened. Again, Thank you all so much. I love this sub so much. :)  You need to bribe your kid.  "Coming down on her" with punishments will not fix the ADHD and only hurt her self image, and will create distance between you and will cause you two to grow apart far faster than you should for half the time you two are being confrontational to each other.

Instead get her teacher this [Sample report card](http://img.medscape.com/slide/migrated/editorial/cmecircle/2006/6043/images/vierhile/slide026.gif), [Article on this](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/5911.html), [Another article](http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/545471_3)

What you are going to do is convert your daughter doing good in school and with the teacher, and not talking to her friends when she knows she should not be into something that benefits your kid.  You are going to "bribe her."  You are going to have your kid make a choice every day, do I stay on task and do my assignment and I get a prize, or do I talk to my friend even though I know I should not.

Our brains are hardwired to seek out interesting things when we are doing boring things that we do not see as benefiting ourselves.  A 9 year old does not understand studying school is important so you get a good job at the age of 29, and thus you can take care of your family at 39, so you can retire at 69, and so on.  They only do school for it is fun or it makes their parents happy, or doing badly makes their parents angry and so on.

But by bribing your kid to do well in school you have now made her goal the same as your goal.

And the bribes do not have to be something stupid like candy or stuff.  Instead it can be if you do well in school this week I will take you and your best friend to the movies, zoo, whatever.  You can make the prize into an experience that everyone enjoys and it can help your daughter socialize and make friends, and you can relax and have fun, and **just enjoy life.**

Does this make sense? I'm tearing up reading this as my daughter is going through a very similar situation - new school, the "hard" teacher, same notes home, but she's in 2nd grade, not 4th. Her teacher started calling me and sending notes home during her **second week** of school, and I explained that she very likely had ADHD during our first conversation. Unfortunately, it seemed to have no impact on how her teacher interacts with her.

We brought my daughter's issues up with her pediatrician and explained that because all of the women in my family have ADHD it is easy for me to see it as a likely diagnosis. Her doctor gave me some forms to fill out and some for her teacher to fill out. When I met with the teacher to pick them up, I learned that she has somehow been instructing for 20+ years with no knowledge of how ADHD works. "Sometimes [your daughter] is actually VERY focused. I don't know how she could have ADD. And she doesn't move around a lot, just whistles and talks at inappropriate times." is almost a direct quote. After that conversation I pushed for a simple chart for the teacher to fill out for my daughter every day (a green, yellow, or red status). When I showed it to my daughter the first thing she asked was **"If I get on green all week do I get a prize!?"** I think /u/roland00 is absolutely right in saying that positive reinforcement (bribery) combined with teacher communication (daily report cards) is the way to go. 

We haven't had the forms processed yet, but I think I will put her on medication if that is what her pediatrician recommends. I hated being medicated when I was younger, but I also think that it has come a long way and that I will be able to monitor the side-effects more easily than my parents were. Going through so much of my life with my ADHD being untreated (or at least not treated very well) was such a tremendous blow to my self-esteem. To use your words, it would be **heartbreaking** to watch my daughter struggle in the same way. I don't have much advice, but maybe my story can help a little.

 When I was 12 it was suggested to my parents that I might have ADHD, both my parents and my family chalked it up to laziness and my Mom's constant hand holding.  

 Now I'm 27, I was diagnosed this past February and it was such a relief to know what was wrong with me. I struggled for years trying to keep up in school, stay calm, keep my emotions in check... all of the things we experience. I wasn't was a A student and the career path I wanted couldn't happened because Universities want the best of the best.  I feel I lost out because my parents didn't get me tested and the help I needed.

 So here I am unemployed... I did go to college for TV & Film, but that was a bust. I'm still struggling to find myself, my self-esteem is so bad I never want to leave my house and I feel like I haven't achieved anything. 

The fact you recognized what your daughter might have and you want her to get her help is amazing. Go for testing and if the topic of medication comes up I would consider it or if medication isn't what you want work with the school to help with an education plan that's tailored to your daughter. 

 My Mom was a hand holder and pretty much did everything for me...don't do that.  I'm sure you won't, but we sometimes have to learn the hard way and failing does just that.  A good push in the right direction is great because she will have to figure out the rest, giving her confidence in her decisions and helping her become a leader. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my parents...but there were some things done wrong early on during my education that have had a negative affected me now.  

I hope your family finds what your daughter needs and from the sounds of it there is a butt ton of love and support for her... there's no doubt as she grow she will become a very awesome young lady! Some teachers are better than others at understanding and working with ADHD kids.  And as much as I don't want to be one of "those" parents that doesn't support teachers and expects all kinds of special treatment for my kid, there are times when you need to push back on a teacher.

Every year my son gets off to a shaky start and I have to have a conference with his teachers and begin the process of getting the teachers acquainted with what things challenge him and what works (and doesn't work) in helping him be able to behave and perform according to the standards they set for the class.  And usually with a tweak here and there, he does.  The teacher wins because he stops distracting other kids, etc., and he wins because he's able to feel successful and not like a failure that's receiving constant negative attention.

Go ahead and set up a meeting with this teacher and talk to her about your concerns.  Tell her that your daughter wants very much to succeed and to meet her expectations but that it's just harder for her to keep quiet and focused than other kids.  See if you can agree on some simple solutions she could try out to see if it improves the situation.  (For my son, problems of him being too talkative usually are improved a lot by changing his seat assignments until the teacher figures out which students just don't engage him as much).

If she's inflexible or won't accommodate even simple suggestions, you should get an official diagnosis of ADHD and get an IEP or 504 plan in place.  (I recommend you go ahead and do this anyway because even if you don't really need it right this minute,  you never know when that might change). 

The process sounds scary but my experience with it was actually pretty positive.  It set up a required process that involved regular meetings with a whole team of people from the principal to the teacher to the school special ed team.  It led to implementing some solutions I didn't even know were possible.

And with the most uncooperative teacher we ever had, it totally broke her down.  She had no choice but to agree to the solutions the team came up with.  And to my surprise, over the course of the year, she actually seemed to get it and to understand my son and by the end of the year the two of them actually had a really good student/teacher relationship.   I already posted in this thread but I am just telling a small story.

In 1st grade (6 to 7) I was an extremely hyperactive kid but not in a bad way.  Instead I was eager to please but often impulsive and screw up, disrupted class (yelling answers instead of hands), did not understand I was too intense for my classmates etc.

We had this token system where you get "Styrofoam Fries" and these fries were put into clean McDonalds red holders and they were converted into prizes 6 times during the year every 6 weeks.

Let me explain the flaws of this token system to the ADHD kid.

Every 6 weeks is way too far away for an ADHD mind.  6 weeks is an eternity.  The longest an elementary school kid can think and oraganize to the future (control their behavior to get an expected gain, but also just how far they think ahead and can feel things) is 48 hours.  Only 2 days, anything past 2 days does not seem real but is instead abstract like a faded memory.

So expecting a token system to motivate you for something in 6 weeks is never going to happen for an ADHD kid or a normal elementary kid.  Such people who benefit from this system are only going to be the kids who were already "perfect."

Instead other problems happened.  I was so excited when I got a token, a fry, for it was reaffrimation that I was a good boy.  But when I lost a fry my day was ruined for it showed me I screwed up and I did not mean to screw up.  I did not mean to make that mistake, I did not mean to be impulsive or not think through the consequences, it just happened.  Just like a kid who drops a glass, they did not mean to break the glass and spill the milk, they wanted to drink the milk not place it on the floor.  But with ADHD it is hard to translate intention into action.

Thus when I lost a fry I would sulk, retract, and gave up.  I no longer had self control to try to do good, it was too late I already screw up.  I was more likely to make mistakes for I just did not care and was not on my best behavior or I just retracted to my imagination for in my imagination I was not the bad one.

-----

So besides doing immediate tokens that have immediate consequences such as the end of the day or only 2 days in the future you need to realize one more thing.  Never take away tokens from an ADHD person.  They earned those tokens, they earned all the times they were the good boy and girl.

Instead when you screw up you do not give them negative tokens, you do not give them punishments.  Instead you give them something to do that will improve their character.  You made a mess with the painting well we are going to clean it up and you have to help.  You also get to help me do the dishes and do X, Y, Z to atone for your impulsiveness.

You need to make sure your kid understand they are not broken.  Punishment should never be punishment for punishment sake.  It should be discouragement from doing bad and when bad is done you have to do everything in your power to make the situation right in addition to taking the punishment. My 9-year-old son has ADHD. He's on meds now (4th grade) and is doing much better in school and at home. He was diagnosed last April and was able to get accommodations for having a disability (extra time for tests, which included short breaks).

Please make an appointment with her doctor. If she gets diagnosed, she can take meds and/or get accommodations at school, which will make life so much better for her (and for you!). Also, look into some coping mechanisms and teach them to her. One thing that has worked great for my son is to set the timer when doing his homework. After half an hour, he gets a 10-minute break, then sets the timer for another half-hour (although he usually finishes before then).

I hope your daughter has an understanding teacher. That makes a world of difference. Good luck. {internet hug} My daughter was diagnosed about 5 years ago, and my wife and I struggled with whether or not to Put her on medication.  We couldn't decide whether we were trying to change who she is or helping her be who she should be.  We ultimately decided on medication, and for us all it was the right decision.  Now a sophomore in high school, she is doing well in school, has a good circle of friends, and gets a lot of poise and confidence from dancing in the school (and two other) dance companies.  In fact, the exercise from dance also helps her immensely.  Not sure this actually answers your question, but hope it helps..... ADHD is inheritable. With 2 parents with it, kids have an 80% chance. Both me and my wife and our 2 kids. Crazy house. Thank you for posting. My 6-yr-old boy appears to have ADHD and is having problems at school, and I'm struggling with how to "deal." As far as the practical stuff, his teachers have been great. He acts just like me so it has been relatively easy to communciate to them how help him, and so far they've been great about it. Edit: I cried too. I'm not excited about him having to deal with the same things I do. But at least he has parents who get it - mine totally didn't. As someone who never knew about her ADHD until she was 20 and had to learn all the coping skills from scratch by herself...

*Please, please* don't punish your daughter for things that are clearly ADHD's fault. I'm not saying don't *discipline* her, but don't outright *punish* her. She needs to learn *self*-discipline, starting right now. Get her a planner, show her how to write everything down as soon as she knows she needs to do it. Make use of gold stars or something positive to keep track of every positive step she makes.

My mom also has ADHD, but never knew until I got myself diagnosed (she's in her mid-50s). I'm forever jealous of her way of coping, which is *going, going, going* nonstop like she naturally produces 90mg of Adderall every day. It's scary to watch sometimes. She gets *too much* done, and literally cannot take a break from working to sit down and relax. She works 100+ hour work weeks. 50 years of this has taken its toll on her physical and mental health, but hey, kudos to her.

That said, she has never been able to understand why I can't approach my issues the same way. It's all she knows. Our relationship has been utterly destroyed after years of her doing nothing but coming down hard on me for forgetting to do homework, refusing to do simple things like unloading the dishwasher, keeping my room clean, or even not hearing what she said the first three times. Most of this felt like it was beyond my control, and it led to years of suicidal depression. Multiple therapists have identified her as the root of it. I recovered almost 5 years ago, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to totally forgive her and move on in our relationship. Recoiling from her hugs and hanging up without telling her I love her are ingrained in my head like an automatic reflex. I don't feel much of any connection with her. It was that bad throughout the years.

I say this because your daughter is about to enter "crunch time". Puberty, especially in girls, is bound to make her symptoms go haywire. She needs to learn how to help herself *now*, in a supportive environment. If I could go back in time to beg and plead my mom to do the same for me, I would give up so many things in life to do it. The course of my life would be so, so different. There's so much I can never repair due to the heavy weight that still hangs on me from all that went wrong.

When I was in 3rd grade, there was a policy where you'd receive detention for missing 10 homework assignments in a marking period. I was in the top 10 of my class at this point, bright eyed and full of confidence. I still remember, to this day, in vivid detail, how it felt when I pulled my (very minor) homework out of my backpack and realized I hadn't completed the back page of a packet. Everyone around me had theirs done. It was a simple misunderstanding, having not heard the announcement that the *entire* packet was due that day. I was probably off in my own world somewhere. I was at 9 missed assignments at this point, but surely the teacher would be realistic and understanding, right? I was a straight A student, never in trouble, eager to learn.

Nope, I got detention. My mother was furious. It was probably the most frustrated and upset I'd been in my entire life; it was traumatizing. Me? *Detention*? 2 hours of sitting in complete silence, not allowed to do anything but copy the dictionary, was my idea of purgatory. 

That punishment did absolutely *no* good for me, because I hadn't deliberately done anything wrong. It did, however, serve to mold my impressionable 8-year-old sense of self, my confidence, and my idea of fairness. I felt nothing but frustration and guilt and depression. I recall still missing at least 5 assignments the next marking period.

That was really just the start of me getting knocked down over and over again until I had nothing left to offer, because all I was given in return was failure and disappointment despite doing my best. If my best will never be good enough, why try at all? I had 30s and 40s on report cards by 10th grade.

Sorry if it's long-winded, but my heart aches to think of another parent meaning well and trying their best, only to unintentionally destroy that beautiful spark. 

Please remember that your daughter doesn't understand *why* she feels the way she does, and can't explain it well. All I knew was that I was forgetful, impatient, and had a short fuse. No amount of punishment was going to help that. It only made it worse.

Try and focus on *positive* reinforcement; it truly makes all the difference. Make sure to mention how she could improve when she messes up, but *do not* let her successes go by unnoticed. Make them a big deal. That's going to work. It took my mom so long to figure this out that her praises still feel meaningless to this day. In fact, it's hard to believe anyone when they tell me I've done well, because I'm always waiting for the ten other things they're about to belittle me for.

Get her the help she needs, whatever that may be. She still has so much time to adjust and figure things out for herself; I'm going to be playing catch-up for a long, long time. I see my 3 year old nephew suffer from some of the most hyperactive ADHD I have ever seen (6am to 11pm: silence only with food in his mouth, never stops running, absolutely cannot get simple things through to him), and despite me finally getting through to his mom about him having it, she refuses to get him treatment because she "doesn't want him on those drugs, they're so bad for him". My heart aches for the kid so bad that I want to hug him all day if he'd stop squirming long enough; things are going to be rough for him when he can't sit still even for 5 minutes in class.

Long story short, your daughter is where I once was. She is so, so lucky that you are realizing what's wrong with her; it's not an easy thing to work with, but the hope is there. Please get through to her while that spark is still alive and well. :) As someone who went through all of high school with ADHD, all I can say is that the absolute best thing that could have happened was my mother having patience with me (she was a single mother). Patience was what I needed. I struggled, and my mother worried, but she always told me, for all those years, simply that she loved me and would always be there to encourage me, but that I needed to find my own way. 

Graduated from a very good private university with honors. Be patient, your child will struggle and make mistakes. There is no magical cure (although I do take 20mg Vyvanse). It is a mental thing that takes years to figure out. I'm truly sorry for your troubles, the only help I can off is to recommend [addforums.com](http://addforums.com) . It is undoubtedly a better place for your request. Much larger user base and body of knowledge to draw from.  MEDSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!  uh, just get her on meds? Doesn't seem very difficult. Yes, this makes perfect sense. I like the idea of a daily report card, but at this point I'm hesitant to involve the teacher that much. The teacher does have a reputation of being difficult and I just don't want to make things worse for my child in the long run (or at least until the end of the year). My daughter saw her report card for the first 9 weeks and started crying. She was incredibly upset with herself and her grades. The thing is they weren't even bad. I wasn't concerned with them at all and hadn't even brought them up. I reassured her that she's a good student and her grades aren't as bad as she thinks. She seemed okay with this after our talk. 

I'm going to definitely try bribing her. I also love your idea of involving another friend. She was pretty popular at her old school and has struggled to find a group of friends at the new school. Doing this might help her out in that area. 

Thank you so much for the links and the great ideas! One last thing on bribing your kid to do what is in everyone best interest.  It works much better if you can make it into a token system instead of just promises.

Give her five color poker chips, or five colors pieces of a pie, or something.  Each one she gets to hold and keep.  The reason why we use 5 different colors it makes it more memorable and the more memorable and vivid the sensory experience is the easier it is for your brain to remember.  It is easy to remember to pay attention in school if you have 5 poker chips bouncing in your pocket.  It is harder to remember if you put those poker chips in a piggy bank and you never see them again.  Out of sight out of mind.

Having 5 colors means less abstract concepts.  I understand she is at the age they start doing higher math like multiplication instead of addition/subtraction but 5 different colors is a lot easier to remember than 4+1 of the same color.  5+1, 6+1 and so on.  It requires more thinking and less knowing, the more thinking your kid has to do the harder her life will be for the more thinking allows ADHD to interact with her life. My daughter's teacher wasn't as uninformed as your child's, but she didn't really seem interested in talking about that being a possibility. She was willing to fill out the form and did agree that if Caitlyn did have it and could get help, then it would be beneficial. 

I think for now we are going to do a daily report card at home and not involve the teacher yet. 

I know there are many other options besides medication, but for the most part I think most of us can agree that the medication helps more than the other methods. My fear is that my daughter is already very small. She has always been <5% on the height and weight charts. She's proportionate, but I'd hate to see her slow down any growth she has coming. (I know this is all stuff to talk to the dr about, I'm just venting/rambling/talking here lol) 

Good luck with your kiddo and her teacher! The good thing is that hopefully I can make sure my daughter grows up with higher self esteem than I did and I can use my experiences to give her a better chance.  We were just discussing what actions we should take if she does have a "bad" daily report from her teacher. We're really leaning towards the token reward system that you had talked about. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your insight. I'm actually looking forward to sitting her down this weekend so we can tell her about this new thing we're going to try. :)  Thank you! I'm going to talk to a good friend who knows the teacher well. I'm not quite sure what the best way to approach her is, or at all. Her teacher last year was a newer teacher, young and amazing. My daughter pretty much worships the ground she walks on lol. So this year was a huge shock to her. But I've tried really hard to not "caudal" her and talk to her about how she'll have harder teachers and more responsibility as she gets older.  Things aren't always that simple when it's your kid. 
 From what I see expressed by the adults on this thread, just "getting on meds" is certainly not the end of the story, and does not solve all issues related to ADHD.  You might want to think twice before posting a response to an obviously concerned parent that completely oversimplifies the issues involved.  In all likelihood, even if an appropriate medication is found, at a helpful dosage, and the side effects are not preclusive, the teacher will still have to make some accommodations in the classroom for remaining issues.  It's not as simple and insulting as just get on the meds. Make the report card simple.

* Positive Class Participation and Payed Attention to Class

* Follow Class Rules

* Gets along with Others and Does Not Distract Others

* Performed Assigned Classwork

Place for Teacher Initials

Place for Notes.  Notes/Comments are not required, they are only there if this day was "unique" like she was really misbehaving or she did really awesome.

She gets 1, 2, 3, 4.  Now 1s and 2s are not punishment she just does not get a token.  3s she gets 1 token, 4s she gets 2 tokens.  Makes sense?

If you can keep it simple, where the teacher has to perform less than 30 seconds of work to do the daily report card the teacher will gladly do it for it makes their lives easier.  Keep the report card with only 4 or 5 tasks on it, preferably 4 


The reason on 4 is has to do with how the human brain thinks, we can only keep 3 or 4 things in mind and if we keep it to 3 or 4 we perform better.  The closer we get to 7 the worse we do.  Some people call this the 7 things plus or minus 2.  But remember the closer it gets to 7 the harder it is to do the primary thought.  If you can keep ideas down to 3 or 4 you are far more effective at communication.  **Short, Sweet, To the Point.**

>My daughter saw her report card for the first 9 weeks and started crying. She was incredibly upset with herself and her grades.

She is starting to get the age where comorbidities are popping up.  She is already forming a negative self image of herself.  You can do 80% right but you always focus on the 20%.  Get her diagnosed and treat the ADHD now for it is so much easier to correct at the age of 9 but much harder at later ages.

Good Luck :) And understand it will be easier for your daughter than you for you got the ADHD looked at when it was early :) I like that you provided a reality check for her about the grades. How many people on this sub tell sad stories of parents who didn't understand and who berated them for stuff they couldn't help? Your daughter will face problems from others at times, but if she knows you're always in her corner, she'll be strong enough to handle it.

Have you checked out ADDitude magazine? They have a lot of articles on all aspects of ADHD, including ADHD parents raising ADHD kids. And the magazine only comes out quarterly (I think), and it's short, so it's not overwhelming. As someone who was diagnosed as a kid and re diagnosed as an adult, I had a daily report card at my public school until I went to a private school with a smaller class size. I took ritalin (and it's generic form) from first or second grade on. 

I have had my struggles, but I have a successful job in software support working with databases and I am very good with people. I am not super successful, but I'm out of school debt, going out with a pretty great girl, and have a decent social life. 

I just learned this year that my mom would have one on ones with the teacher to find out the teachers style and see what we could do to mix my struggles with that teacher's style. You absolutely should go to her teacher and talk about these things. If the teacher actually has a passion to teach, she will do what she can to help this student learn.

I had plenty of struggles. Days where I would sob to my mom about not understanding what was wrong with me. She taught me that  I will always have to work harder for the same results and it will never be any different. The thing in my family is that we are very stubborn, so I've never given up. I strongly encourage you to tell your daughter that life will not be easy but she has the ability to overcome her struggles. She will just have to do it forever and accept that as a part of herself.

Easy to say, but looking back I feel like I've gotten over the hump of balancing my ADHD struggles and how to fit in with people. I still have my odd moments, but my daily fear of losing my job or not having any friends is gone and inside is a burning passion and love for proving people wrong about my skills and abilities. I continue to do so and man it gets me higher every time. I hope some day your daughter can take on all that personal struggle and realize that there is always an option, always a way and that you are NEVER trapped. Once you get that attitude, you won't be able to save the world, but damn things will change. It sounds like your situation may also differ in that you do not need to involve the teacher to get an accurate view of how the school day went. My daughter will absolutely pick and choose from what happened during the day so we really needed the ratings to come from the teacher. 

Yeah, I really do agree with your stance on medication, and also feel that your fears about it are certainly valid. I guess we can only do what we can with the guidance of our doctors and just keep a super keen eye on how the meds are affecting them. 

Thank you, and good luck to you too! I have the same hopes for mine. =] I have heard, I think it was from Russell Barkley, that the fears about growth issues are most likely unfounded, that the growth issues have been shown in studies to be much less significant than originally believed, and they are temporary in nature. You said you were going to have her evaluated, what's the problem? Please consider meds.  Meds help a lot of kids, *meds are not for all kids* and some people on an instinctual level dismiss medication without truly thinking is this med right for my kid.  What I am saying is try to make a calm collected decision and be open to all options.

You can always discontinue meds if they do not work for your kid.  Meds are not for all kids 10 to 20% of kids see more negatives than positives, with medications after trying a couple different drugs one at a time.  This means 80%+ see positive changes due to medication.

Talk and think and then do right with your daughter.  Every kid is unique and you need to treasure what makes her special. Can you elaborate on the 1,2,3 & 4's? Like....a "1 is no problem, did this activity without any concern" or "4-did not complete classwork, stayed in from recess"

 I'm all for meds! I know first hand t g e difference they can make. I just don't want to put all my hope in them.  Higher is better


**5:** This number really does not exist, but this is when the kid is perfect.  When a 5 is obtained instead a 4 should be given and then specific notes at the note section.  Think of this as an A++  The reason why there are no 5s for we want to promote a system of consistency where the child can feel they always hit a great day instead of a good day if that make sense.  We are not asking for perfect, people are human, but if we have a perfect on the scale then in effect we are asking for it.

**4:** Your kid is actually able to obtain this level.  Think of this as an A.  For example with classwork they finished all their classwork.  With follow rules they did not misbehaved and was a distraction in class. With class participation they contributed when it was neccessary, you do not get extra points for super contribution (often this is connected to impulsivity where you want to show how awesome you are, that you do not think of raising your hand, or you out yelled the other classmate or did not think before you act.)

**3:** Are like a B.  The kid is seriously try to do good, you can tell they are trying.  They just need a little nudge and with a little tweaking you can get a 4 out of them.

**2:** Are like a C.  They are neutral.  The kid was not paying attention in class but he was not misbehaving, he just did not care.  Cs are like apathy, 2 are just as serious as 1 but in a different way.  2 means we need to figure out ways to have your kid succeed.  1s are things that need immediate consequences.

**1:** Are like a D.  These are when a kid is engaging with others and distracting them and making them misbehave.  1s are like they did not do any classwork.  1s are like they were mean to their classmates, maybe not a fight but definately something that needs to be taken care of that very day.  1s should always have a small note explaining what happened.  Often you do not need to call the teacher but you need to sit your daughter down not as in trouble but instead a heart to heart, have your daughter explain her feelings (not what happened but instead her feelings so she can express herself to an ally) and you two need to go over what happened and figure out how to make sure this does not happen again.  Think of 1s like falling off a bicycle and scratching the skin off your knees.  1s mean you need to watch her more and be proactive to try to stop the problems before they become the next thing.

The last score should not be a number but instead a letter **X**.  Xs are the equivalent of Fs.  They are drastic things that means we are in crisis mode.  She punch another class mate.  She is now failing if this was middle or high school.  There is a consistent pattern of not doing class rules and disrespecting authority.  **X**s mean the kid is getting in trouble as soon as mom or dad comes home.

Now with Xs there are three things you always have to remember with ADHD kids and especially with ADHD parents with ADHD kids.

**A**  It is in the past, you can't change it, all you can do is stop it in the future.

**B**  Your kid needs to express his/her feelings, he needs to seperate his/her actions from what she was feeling.  She needs to learn that even if her feelings are legitimate what she did is never acceptable.  Lastily you need to teach her a more acceptable way of expressing her feelings.  If she is so tired of math for she can't get it and she feels stupid and she gives up she needs to talk to you or the teacher instead of just not do the assignment and hope you will not fight her over a single math worksheet (this is Oppositional Defiant Disorder, I blow up so I get what I want, I may do it intentionally or I may do it without realizing it for I run on impulse and I do not think things through.)  Physical ODD occurs less in girls but that is because ODD does not have to be physical, it can also be passive aggressive, manipulative, lying, etc.

**C** The punishment must fit the crime.  When you give too strong of punishment you have changed the issue **to you being mean** instead of you being right, the parent, the authority figure, the person who is looking out for your kid, the person who loves you but does this for it is in your best interest.  Be too mean and your kid will stop listening to your advice and will work against you.

C cont)  you also have to realize that even if the Kid knows they did wrong they can't change the past and they know it.  You keep on reminding them they did wrong does not help and can damage your self esteem.

Instead with C often punishments need to be immediate, not next week, not this weekend, but instead now.  They need to be something that keeps the kid active so they do not get distracted or retreat to their daydreaming.  Giving kids extra chores, while taking away 1 thing from the kid is often the better outcome than taking everything away from them.

The reason why we take away 1 thing is that you do this so the kid realize they are in trouble and they need to change.  The 1 thing is a signaling mechanism, by limiting it to 1 though they understand the issue is not the punishment but the reason why you punishing them (you punched the other girl, or you did not do your math homework.)  Now with normal kids grounding takes away fun time and thus they learn the lesson.  Grounding does not work with ADHD kids, instead you need to do time replacement.  You take away their time and replace it with something else.  This should not be something that is just to punish them but instead something productive such as chores or making amends to the person they hurt, disrespected, disappointed etc.  In both situations the kid loses free time and independence but with ADHD kids you have to spend more time enforcing the punishment.  You have to watch them, you have to make sure the punishment does not seem too extreme but you need to punish them with equal time that you punish a non ADHD kid.  Sorry this is more work for you, but ADHD kids need some extra help with certain issues and spending more time doing the correct punishment (instead of the easy punishment, you are grounded) is one of the things ADHD kids need.

Does this make sense, I am sorry if I rambled. >I just don't want to put all my hope in them.

That is very good and the outlook you should have.  Meds are not the answer by themselves, you need to do everything with meds but when you do both results are better than only one.

I am sorry if the earlier post comes too preachy but I seen parents not really consider when they should for medication sounds scary.

Sorry :) It makes sense. It was quite a bit of text to read, but I'm going to have my boyfriend read this. I was trying to explain it to him, but didn't do you justice. :) I really appreciate you're help. Having at least something to try is better than I was last night. Thank you. So much.  Sorry for the rambling and the long text.  I try my best to shorten it, but I just can't my brain does not work that way (it is a comorbidity of ADHD, I am going to shut up and not explain why unless you ask.)

That said if I explain it to an non ADHD person they can usually summarize what I said in 200 words in 20.  I wish I had that skill.
