X-post /r/getdisciplined: turn your smartphone's color setting to grayscale. The lack of color stimulus will encourage you to waste less time mindlessly browsing the internet throughout the day. https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5skqnt/advice_turn_your_smartphones_colour_settings_to/

My own note (not x-post): I just changed my settings so I don't have any anecdotal evidence that this works! I have the grayscale option on by default. It is only when I need to see colors that I turn it off. At first I thought I needed colors for a lot of things, but now I mostly use my phone in grayscale.

It is no miracle cure, just one of the thousands of things one can do to make ADHD less of a problem.

Cellphones can be compared to the other environments that we navigate. Like every other environment the cellphone can be a distracting one, and as in every other environment people with ADHD should try to make them less distracting. The difficult part is both recognizing distractions and finding ways to combat them. And this difficult part should be thought of as a skill to learn and to master. Good luck!

Edit: to sum up my experience: combined with other interventions* it changed my phone from being a casino to being an office.

* I deleted everything fun (even Excel had to go!) and removed anything that was beeping, blinking, attention-grabbing or smoothly animated. Anecdotal evidence from using this tip 1 day: successful; I was definitely bored with my phone more easily.
