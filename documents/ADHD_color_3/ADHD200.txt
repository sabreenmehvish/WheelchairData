Good fiddle toys for school? With school coming up soon, I was thinking about investing in a couple fiddle toys to help keep me focused in class. Do you guys have any recommendations? Doodle, doodle, doodle. Doodling keeps your hands busy and your ears and mind open. It is not an uncommon thing in school and it is not distracting to the other students. As long as you are paying general attention to what is being said you should be fine. I have a bunch of Tangle toys. I'm actually playing with one right now. Not exactly a fiddle toy, but it works in a similar way for me and looks more professional (I'm in graduate school) is a bunch of different colored pens (ink joy is the brand in using right now).   
  
Last time I was in school, undiagnosed, I tried to come up with color codes and make it all mean something. Didn't work.  
This time, I just switch pen colors whenever I feel like it so the pages of my notes look different.  The semi - random colors form kind of a visual index that makes it easier for me to remember things. "Oh yeah, that was on the purple / green page."  
More importantly, when I start to drift off in class, I look at my pens and get an eyeful of color, then my notes look different. In a 4 hour night class in advanced math, I need that!  I usually end up with 10-15 pages of notes. I love pencils (Seriously. I have some $30 mechanical pencils coming via a Kickstarter and I can't wait.) but 10-15 pages of grey would shut down a normal brain, mine would be frippin doomed.   
  
Also, doodling. I did a research paper on fidgeting and doodling a few weeks ago. The research on fidgeting is, IMHO, weak. The research on Doodling, on the other hand, is a solid "yes" with or without ADHD.  I bought [these] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P8MGVW6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s03) recently for my son but I find that it helps me also.  Plus it's quiet, simple and not distracting plus discreet.  For the home and doing homework, I fiddle with a speedcube. The fidgets from fidgetland.com are good. 

Right now I'm big into linked keyrings. I bought a whole bunch of titanium ones off ebay. Lighter than steel and they don't make your hands stink. I'll post a photo of their configurations tomorrow.

* 2 joined rings.
* 4 joined rings where each ring is only connected to 2 other rings and not the third. It's like a doubled version of the first 2 joined rings. Very fun to play with. 
* 8 joined rings in a 'ball'. Every ring is connected to every other ring.  [deleted] With doodling it is not artistry that matters, but patterns that you can take and repeat and grow across a page. Something with lots of detail you don't have to think about. Fractal style drawings work really well.
