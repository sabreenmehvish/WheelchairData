What are your lifestyle or behavioral tips for managing ADHD? Obligatory ADHD, "I love writing long posts but I only read short ones!" :D

I was recently diagnosed (PI) and realized that a slew of my positive habits were actually ADHD coping mechanisms. I had stumbled upon many of these behaviors without really being aware of how important they were or why they helped. Since being diagnosed I've been able to recognize and prioritize the right coping mechanisms. 

Medication has been huge but without other lifestyle and behavior changes I'd still be spinning my wheels, only faster because of the stimulants. Please post all of your daily routines/habits etc... that you have developed to help cope with your ADHD. Here are mine. 

* The most helpful tip I got from the book, "Driven to Distraction." He talks a lot about ADHD people needing external structure. I took this to heart and turned as many parts of my life as I could into a system or routine.

 
* I have two laminated hygiene checklists on my bathroom mirror, one for waking up and one for going to bed. I rarely forget to brush my teeth, take my meds etc... anymore. 


* I have a laminated checklist in my shower. Before I did this I could just stand in the shower for 30 minutes spacing out but not actually cleaning myself. Now I progress from head to toes in a timely fashion because the process is a habit.


* I have a bag that I take with me everywhere. I feel naked without it. Meds, water, my To Do book, a notepad, a book, a raincoat and any other miscellaneous things I may need that day. The bag is strictly organized - items have homes where they always live. If it's not in my hands, it goes back to the same spot every time.  

* Most items in my house have a home. There's the keys/wallet/phone basket. The meds corner. The backpack chair. The sweaters, shirts and coats all have their own parts of the closet. My headphones hang on the same push pin every day. I still misplace things all the time but this helps a lot. 

* I have a To Do book that acts as my daily planner and calendar at the same time. Whenever I learn of any "be here at X time" obligation I write it down IMMEDIATELY.



* Every night I spend literally 3-5 minutes planning out the next day. First the big obligations. Then whatever obligations I have, I look at the free hours. I take my, "loose" responsibilities and fit them into the free time. This is how I go to the store, go running, make phone calls, virtually everything. When 75% of my day is planned out the night before it takes so much less mental effort to figure things out. When I wake up in the morning all I have to do is follow my list with a bit of flexibility, instead of frantically try to remember wtf I'm even supposed to be doing that day. 


* When planning my next day, I will also check on google maps how long it takes to get from point A to B and write down the exact time I NEED to leave to get there 10 minutes early. I'm still late more than most people but wow this helps.


* Exercise is also a system. I go to the gym weds/fri/sun. In the gym I follow a workout routine from /r/fitness, with a workout app. I don't have to organize anything in my head, I just follow the prompts on my phone. On tues/thurs/sat I choose between climbing, running, playing handball or soccer.  I take a full week off of exercise and switch /r/fitness routines every 10 weeks, or when my progress at the gym totally stalls, whichever comes first. 


* I socialize on a schedule as much as possible. Trivia nights, rock climbing courses, pick up soccer games. This means that 2-4 times a week I'm being social even when I don't manage to plan something on my own. Also so much less anxiety when you are doing something with people instead of just, "hanging out." 


* I quit weed and coffee. I could never just have 1 cup of coffee, or take a few puffs on a saturday night. It was extreme use or none at all for me. /r/decaf, /r/leaves


* I quit video gaming for the same reason. 12 hours a day and losing jobs or no gaming at all. Classic ADHD, destructive stimulation seeking. I'm just lucky I was hooked on pot and gaming instead of hard drugs.  /r/stopgaming. 


* The Internet/social media is a source of constant novelty and stimulation, which makes it an ADHD landmine. I turned my phone black and white. If you're constantly on your phone/computer (when there's other stuff you should be doing) seriously try this. Color is a big part of visual stimulation and the most addictive sites on the internet know about this. Imagine watching Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in black and white. Not nearly as appealing right? Turn the color off on your phone and it is a LOT less interesting.


* Focus me app on Android, Self control App on all IOS devices. I literally can not go on reddit, youtube, netflix, any porn site etc... To deactivate or delete the focus me app I have to type in a randomized 100 character sequence. This makes it a lot harder to just fuck off on the internet for 9  hours when you're supposed to be writing a paper.

* I go to sleep and wake up at the same time every single day, even the weekends. No screens at all after 10:30pm. (Can set apps that force this behavior.)

* Self control app on my computer. I'm limited to 45 minutes a day with time wasting internet activities. All social media, youtube, reddit, news sites etc... When I don't have that limit (that I can't find a way to avoid) I will spend all day on reddit instead of doing important other tasks.


* I had my roommates put passwords on the TV, Xbox and all their devices. I would now have to go to the public library to waste a day on the internet. 


* I count my caloric intake with a kitchen scale and an app. Fewer problems with binge eating/constant overeating as a source of stimulation. When you have the hard caloric numbers in front of you there's a lot less decision making involved. Eat X calories and you won't gain weight, no more mind games. 

* Cold showers are a great source of daily stimulation. Try them for just a few days :0. /r/coldshowers

And those are the ways I consciously manage my ADHD. It may seem really extreme but I have found that living like this is so much easier than having no plans or systems at all. Before I was diagnosed every day was a mess of procrastination, confusion, boredom and addiction. After being diagnosed, medicated and then experimenting with systems like these, months later I am living the most stable, calm day to day life I have ever experienced. 

Spitball your strategies and we can all see what sticks!  These are good tips for eliminating distractions, but to me some of them reach into the territory of "removing everything stimulating and interesting about life and the world we live in". In a lot of way, it's sounds like a checklist of things I'd give to someone if they asked me what it felt like to be clinically depressed or struggling with OCD.

The thing about turning your phone black and white is what really got me. I was clinically depressed for several years as a result of underlying PTSD and undiagnosed ADHD-PI. One of the major eye openers and keys to seeing the light at the end of that tunnel was the rediscovery of my passion for color, specifically it's presentation in artwork and visual design. It was the first hobby I was able to rekindle and find joy in.  Picking it back up was meditative and healing.

I struggle with this myself.  I've come to the conclusion that I need structure for certain areas of my life in order to succeed - and often it must be external and enforced.  At what point do you draw the line between living your life and doing things you enjoy, regardless of whether or not society deems them productive or not, and stripping away everything that is unique about your personality and habits?  Is there true happiness in this?  If life must be so rigid, who are we living for? 

Spontaneity and impulsiveness create some of life's greatest experiences, and with some moderation a typical ADHD'r is able to capitalize on both in some pretty profound ways.

EDIT: I'm not criticizing you, by the way.  I agree with many of your points, but I think it's important to recognize that middleground between structure and chaos that makes shit worth living. Systems and routines turn me on lol. I love lists. Look into bullet journaling, too.  Until now I didn't know my obsession with organizing was part of my ADD. But it makes sense. If I don't write it down, I won't remember it.  I had a friend volunteer to text me asking for updates on my progress. I get a reward when I start in a timely manner and one when I finish a predetermined amount of work. Best thing is it's all a surprise! I dont know when the texts will come or what the prize will be. A few prizes: a large slice of pizza, a pumpkin spice latte, my lawn mowed, a text detailing my best traits. This has really helped! Woah the grayscale on the phone thing! I never knew! I hope you’re right about it helping stay off. 

On another note: how do you feel about all this structure you’ve put in place? I’m pretty functional thanks to weekly routines, calendars, to-do lists and reminders. BUT ... it’s kind of like putting my iPhone on grayscale. It makes life pretty dull for me. I don’t like routines. I don’t like planning my day out every day. I like being a little messy and to float through the day without being weighed down by a list or alarms. One thing I don’t do is schedule fun time, which could possibly help. But sometimes I read these tips and I’m like, yeah, but the “side effects” are awful. Maybe they fade over time? Meditation and mindfulness have helped a great deal. Those are my tips. Guided meditation works well for us with ADHD because we can concentrate on the voice speaking and less likely to get lost in our head. SmilingMind is totally free smartphone app (also web). They also teach you about mindfulness. Another great free app is "The Breathing App" which teaches you resonance breathing, something very well documented and supported by science. # I do the following:

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I keep a very strict calendar on google calendar that I plan my every hour** (except the leisure hours so I allow myself to have a break from it all and let my ADHD take over.)

I've been doing this for years but it never worked because:

* I didn't know I had ADHD which was causing me to lose interest once the high of "getting my life on track" wore off.
* I have always been absolutely terrible at time estimation. I would plan out the week, with specific goals/checklists and when I didn't complete them with the very ambitious time I had scheduled for them it would then create a snowball effect on all of my other goals as each incompleted goal rolled over to the next day and by friday I would have twice as many goals to complete as originally planned, which caused me to be very overwhelmed.

&#x200B;

How I fight these:

* **I now record at the end of each scheduled "event" exactly what was completed, and how long it took, as well as a mathematically calculated average "insert task completed"/hr.**  If my goal was to complete an assignment for example, I would calculate how many questions I completed in an hour on average and write something like "7.5Q/hr" depending on how long it took. This then allows me to have a base line to go off of when I want to plan for a similar task in the future, allowing me to allocate enough time to actually complete it, instead of having an unobtainable goal.
* **I have picture frames with general life goals written on them that are facing me when I wake up in the morning.** This reminds me of what my focus should really be throughout the day.

And to be completely honest, I am actually going through the loss of the high of "getting my life on track" as my recent diagnosis is now 4 to 5 months old which is when I started going all in on getting my life on track. I still schedule/record when it is that I study, but lately I haven't been sticking to predetermined plans which is something that im going to try and find a way to fight. Will update if I come up with an idea.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**I also have a secondary physical calendar that is quite large containing weekly goals that are much, much more specific.** For example I have a goal right now to maintain 20 hours of out of class study time per week, so at the end of the week I record how many hours I have put toward this goal so I can see exactly how well I did during the week, and where I could've improved, and reflect on why I did or didn't meet the goal.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another thing that I do is **I have started eliminating all forms of entertainment/non-productive activities that I classify as "high reward, low effort" activities.** I hypothesized that if our brains are chemically hardwired to seek the fastest dopamine reward it knows how to, then anything productive which are usually high effort, low reward, will not be able to compete with activities/hobbies that are high reward low effort.

In light of this hypothesis I have since replaced the following hobbies:

* Youtube (The app from my phone has been removed)
* Video Games
* Porn
* Reddit (the app from my phone has been removed)
* My phone from my bedside

&#x200B;

With:

* Golf
* Snowboarding (I have always snowboarded, I just do it significantly more often now.)
* Social activities

My hope here is that once my brain kind of "forgets" how rewarding these activities were, ill stop craving them, and the things that used to pale in comparison such as the reward you get from completed a school assignment, or studying for a test would seem a lot more "rewarding" in my brain making them better able to compete for my attention

I want to say that right now I am missing video games A LOT. I miss how easy it was to see how well you were performing when competing and the hyperfocus that it just effortlessly brings. I miss it a lot still, but I think soon I will be able to stop having cravings as its approaching 7 to 8 months since my hiatus from video games started.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I have also Purchased new noise cancellation headphones (Bose QC35II)** let me tell you these things work absolute wonders for getting yourself into the hyperfocus state. All of those little noises that you used to turn your head to see what they were, Gone. All of those people having a conversation near you that seems juicy and that you just had to listen to, Gone. These things allow you to hear nothing but the instrumentals that you have playing and your own thoughts.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**I also consistently go to areas where I know there will be other people performing the same task that I need to do as a constant reminder that of what it is that I need to be doing.** Places like the school library or coffee shops. We lead very similar lives op. Serious question: Are you happy with the lifestyle?  Saving this! Yeah I don't like the idea of sticking to a routine but it really does cutdown on mental load and having to force myself to do things. Good tips These are great ideas!

What work out app do you use? Love it. I do some of those and now i have some new tips to implement and then forget about them in 2 weeks ! :D Will try my best. I use physical planners in conjunction with google calendar to schedule my day. I plan all my “needs to be productive things by myself”for the time of day Iam most productive(for me it’s morning/afternoon after 4pm I have great trouble  focusing on things that aren’t fun ) and will schedule free time in the evening so even if I get on hyper focus video game sleep tends to end it. I only bring my cards on days I need to buy stuff to limit impulse purchases and write down every purchase.  I need my game/play time. What did you replace the time with ? I'm just gonna break this comment into parts. I'll do it according to the areas of my life that I have the biggest problems.

**Time**

My therapist & I have come to the realization that I really don't conceptualize time like a normal person. I once said a drive from one city to a next takes me 2 hours when she definitely knew it only took like 45 minutes. I wasn't lying or being intentionally deceptive, I just honestly thought it took me 2 hours. To this end, I use the following tips to help me manage my time blindness.

1. I live & breathe by Google Calendar. As soon as I receive information that is attached to a specific date(s), I put it in Google Calendar. I have my calendar set up to give me a certain set of notifications when I create a new event or task. 

2. I use aTimeLogger to track my time. This is something my therapist suggested & is also mentioned in the book "You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid Or Crazy?! A Self-help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder" by Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo. They call it a "one-rat study" or something to that effect. I have the app set to ask what I'm doing every 15 minutes so I don't forget to log my activities. This really helps me plan things out because it gives me a realistic view of how long things will take.

**Organization**

My psychiatrist has diagnosed me with OCD. I think this is why I am able to be organized. My ADHD however, makes me unable to consistently keep up with my organizational systems. This is triggering & has led to all sorts of tantrums because everything must be right.

I've been working on this with my therapist & these are the following systems we've developed for helping me consistently stay organized & regulate my expectations/emotions when my systems fail.

1. Everything must have a place & everything must be in it's place. I have a hook for my robes & my towels. My mirror is always on the back of my door. My keys go on the hook next to my door. My shoes go on the shoe rack next to my bed. You get the idea.

2. I keep a huge running to-do list on my phone. Everything that I think I might need to do goes on it. I delete & rearrange things throughout the day but I always, always, always right every task I think of on that list. It helps my anxiety so much because I'm not afraid of forgetting anything. 

3. I religiously use my planner. Every night I sit down, look at my to-do list & pick out the tasks that matter the most & need to be completed as soon as possible. The way I have my planner set up is such that one side of the box is for things I must do that day & the other side is for things I would like to do that day. When I write things on my "must do" side, I am making a personal commitment to myself that says I will not sleep until these things are accomplished. I then pick out 2-4 things that need to be done. You'd be surprised at how much becomes unimportant once you commit yourself to doing it at all costs.

4. I have routines & schedules for everything. I know when I'm going to go to the gym & what I'll be doing. I know what chores I have to do each day. I know what I need to do when I wake up & go to sleep. I also lay out my clothes the night before. I choose what book I want to read, which hobby I want to work on, etc. This helps combat my decision fatigue. I don't have to choose what to do, I just follow the schedule. I keep these in Google Keep because it lets me check things off & uncheck them in the exact order I typed them.

5. I keep a notebook for random ideas/plans I need to draw out. Saves me from having 50 million pieces of Post-It notes all over the place.

**Money**

Honestly, The best tip that I have for this is to withdraw all living expenses as soon as you get paid. If you spend over in one area, too bad so sad. Live with the consequences. I once had to eat ramen for a week because I spent too much money on food the previous week & had to save all of my money for gas.

**Focus**

1. I take my medication on time. 

2. I decluttered the fuck out of my room & it was amazing how much easier it was for me to focus when I didn't have so much visual noice everywhere.

**Health**

1. I do my best to meditate consistently

2. I try to consistently go to the gym. Helps keep my head clear. When I go to the gym I instinctively start eating better. It's like I don't want all of my hard work to go to waste.

3. Again, I take my medication on time. And consistently.

4. I use Daylio (a journaling app) to check in with my emotions & remember what & when things happen so I can bring it up in therapy.

That's all I can think of right now.  I love all of this except for the stop gaming part. its the one thing i can derive pleasure from guilt and anxiety free. 

that doesnt mean it wouldnt be a positive for me to quit gaming, but its the one thing in a very crowded home that is MINE and mine alone. finding a better alternative presents a challenge. 

I have a full time job and spend as much time gaming as i do working. i have had down periods in the past and picked up other craft/making focused stuff, but when something open ended with a good in game lore/world/story, i'm hooked. Sounds like you turned from ADHD into OCD. But honestly: How do you manage to maintain that strict routine and this high level of self-monitoring when you have ADHD? I'm really curious.  Lately I’ve been thinking that I might be better suited to a slower pace of life. I’m most anxious uptight, and miserable when l’m in a frame of mind that says “You should have reached this milestone or done that by now.” Nagging at me in the back of my mind is a timeline and an image of success that I’m not sure is entirely mine. 

If the goal is to be the best/earn the most/achieve the most, then it’s going to take a mountain of focused energy and a whole lotta schedule-juggling to make that happen, if I could even pull through. But I’d like to think that I’d be content with being able to pay the bills, have a job I don’t mind doing, and have time to enjoy doing the things I like and spend with people I care about (or, crazy idea: get paid to do things I enjoy, what a luxury that would be!) I think you make a salient point and I agree with you. My post might make it seem like I live a rigid, Spartan lifestyle where every day is the same and every week is the same. This is true but only for the skeleton of my life. Daily hygiene, food, weekly social events, the daily planner - most of my weeks have a lot of variety in them but the variety lies nestled between this foundational structure. I also have 1-2 days a week where I plan on having no plan. However instead of just, "do whatever I want today" I make a To Do list of relaxing/recreational activities I might want to do throughout the day and then choose from the list as I read/movies/exercise my way through a Sunday. 

Without the foundation of structure my, "chaos," days (blood for the blood god! lol) turn into food/internet binges. The days where I have obligations turn into coin flips of whether I'll go or not. You get the picture.

For the stimulation part, I had reached a point with coffee/weed/gaming/internet addiction where I had totally ruined my life - it's what got me diagnosed in the first place. I used some classic addiction recovery strategies by weaning myself off of all of these stimulating behaviors but importantly replacing them with other healthy, sustainable sources of stimulation. For me this is LOTS of exercise, including fun exercise like climbing and soccer. Voracious reading, chess clubs, socializing more. Then there are all the things I do that aren't routine but I still plan for in advance.

 I definitely see your perspective. It is a great point, and I can't definitively say that I don't miss or struggle with boredom which if I am not careful will lead me to depression.       



That being said, I think you are assuming that he is eliminating what "society deems non productive" when he might be eliminating what he deems non productive. I personally have eliminated similar stimulating activities from my life not because society thinks I should not be doing it, quite frankly, I don't give a shit what society thinks I should be doing, I care about what it is that I want to accomplish.      



I want to play video games and become a doctor, but one of them is impeding on the other when I try to do it. I have no choice other than to remove it because I have tried time and time again to balance both of them but my impulsiveness and addiction to stimulation always wins. So while it is a nice thought to be able to keep it in my list of hobbies, I care more about becoming a doctor one day then I do about being entertained for a few hours today. Routines are cool until something unexpected happens, then it's a goddamn shit storm. So, that isn't an option in my world. Note taking, calendars, and reminders are the ultimate life savers. Even then...its not always effective, but the best I've dealt with yet... Santiago? This was my experience too.

For a long time I thought I had something like OCD because of the notes and plans I was constantly writing and restarting over and over.

Now I recognise it as a coping mechanism associated with a brain that struggles with organisation and planning ahead.

I could never trust myself to direct my attention or order tasks, so attempted to impose some sort of structure on myself

(largely unsuccessfully because I didn't understand what was wrong with me exactly) I want to be friends with your friend! 

Seriously, that is some deep love.  Wow, that is an awesome friend!  Just keeping up with and keeping track of schedules and routines can be exhausting for me.

I like to mentally schedule “spontaneous” time, where I can say yes to grab a meal/drinks with friends at the last minute. Because I suck at planning hangouts in advance, and if I’ve called it a day, gone home and a friend texts me at 8pm out of the blue wanting to catch a movie, the answer is 4/5 times gonna be no because I’m not thaaat spontaneous nor mentally prepared to be out and about for another three hours. 

Routines are amazing and I’m only just realizing how much I miss them when I don’t have them.  Yeah it's nuts. I've experimented with turning the color back on for 1-2 days and my phone use skyrockets. When I happen to use someone else's device for 2 minutes it is noticeable, even just typing in my contact info or something. I can feel my brain go, "OH shiny!"

I love the structure because of how much less stressful my life is now. However the structure is just the skeleton of my days - I'm not living a pleasureless sterile existence where every minute of my day is planned and accounted for with German efficiency. I have my daily hygiene, daily responsibilities, planner, to do list and then my weekly activities/socializationing. In between all this structure there is novelty, excitement and exploration but without the structure acting as a foundation, free time would be chaotic and destructive like it has been for me in the past. 

Also a lot of my weekly routine is inherently fun/stimulating anyway. I play pick up soccer, go rock climbing, play chess, handball, go to the gym, a trivia night with a lot of shouting. If I get burnt out on one of these things I'll replace it with biking, D&D or playing pool - anything that has a weekly meetup that combines socializing, fun and a timetable has worked really well for me. I still don't do everything on my list. But I feel more like it's an active choice rather than just being in that distraction fog.

"I have decided for the next hour I will watch this episode rather than do the dishes". Rather than just spontaneously turning on the telly. Meditation is great. Within 2 months I was really feeling the benefits. Eg awareness of my daydreaming/impulses and pullling away. Could also do 12h+ study days during exams (look, I wasn’t about to fail all my classes, only failed half lol). 

Of course my wonderful routine came crashing down... that was the most at peace I felt. Take me back 😍 Wow these are great, especially the, "task completed/hour" rate. I really struggle with estimating how long it will take me to do something. It feels like it takes me 1.2-5x longer than other people to complete tasks which can be frustrating and demoralizing. 

Eliminating, "high reward low effort" activities is exactly what I did as well! /r/stopgaming, /r/decaf, /r/leaves, /r/nosurf, /r/pornfree. Then I replaced all of that over time with healthier, sustainable behaviors like chess, climbing, soccer and going to the gym. I very slowly weaned myself off all of it while very slowly introducing new habits and a few months later, wow what a change. 

I'm also in a similar boat where I'm no longer riding the high of, "getting my shit together." For the first time ever my shit is kind of together but now I don't really know what to do now. I'm busy most of the time but I feel like I need a replacement for a significant, attainable long term goal I can work towards in small steps. What are in your picture frames? "#YOLO"? lol I really am. I'm just going to copy my response to a different comment that answers a similar question.

I love the structure because of how much less stressful my life is now.

A few of my routines seem, "extreme," from the outside, like for example weighing all my food on a scale, or using parental control apps on my phone to stop myself from going on reddit/youtube. However from my point of view, it's SO much easier than the life I was living before. I used to use ten times the mental energy trying to regulate the same behaviors, only to be mostly unsuccessful. Binge Eating, overeating, on reddit 4-12 hours a day. Now I don't even really need to think about it, I just weigh my food and literally CAN'T waste time on devices. 
 
All the structure I've put in place was to counteract really destructive, unsustainable habits I had developed. Maybe in the future I can experiment with a looser lifestyle but for now, when I drop the structure it opens my personalized pandora's box of bad habits.
 I use, "Personal Training Coach." Somebody on /r/fitness made it and it's FREE. It's super simple and comes with all the workout routines you find on /r/fitness anyway. Beginner, intermediate and advanced. It keeps track of the weight your lifting and automatically increases it at the appropriate times. You can even create your own workout plan from a huge list of exercises.

The app could use some streamlining but overall I'm impressed. For a free app with no ads it does a LOT, where most other fitness apps require a subscription or try to be a fitness/calorie/social media app all at the same time. 

For calorie counting the terribly named, "Fat Secret" I found to be the best free/no ads calorie counter.  Specifically the behaviors I replaced were obsessive gaming, internet browsing, caffeine consumption, pot smoking, porn use and binge eating. 

I replaced them with getting a job, 8 hours of sleep every night, 5-6 days a week vigorous exercise, healthy eating, reading, journaling, soccer, climbing, hackey sack, meditation, chess, a new job, a lot more socializing and streamlining my life as a hobby.

I'm going to preface the following by saying this is coming from someone who put 5,000 hours into steam between 2014 and this past July. This doesn't count Xbox, Origins, Uplay, Blizzard games, Twitch or Youtube. "Needing" game/play time isn't real. What we *need* is stimulation, tangible goals to work towards, a sense of accomplishment, an observable increase in skill, perceived social status, perceived social celebration. Gaming gives us ALL of that in a neat package, no wonder it's so fun. However if you analogously compare these human needs with our need for food, fulfilling those needs with gaming is like replacing a healthy diet with 2,500 calories of table sugar. 

Gaming, especially in the last ~5 years, has become a hyper advanced technicolor skinner box. Developers put a LOT of resources into maximizing addiction levels and playtime. It's the same behavioral psychology as gambling, only much more sophisticated. Gambling has the stigma because we've had thousands of years to figure it out and it's also much easier to ruin life with gambling. I'm a gaming addict and it literally ruined my life, which is why I have such an extreme view of video games. 

If you have an appropriate relationship with gaming it's a whole other story but I know when it comes to ADHD, it's a rule of thumb to avoid addiction prone behaviors and search for stimulation from healthy sources.  "My advice is to remove everything enjoyable/interesting/stimulating in your life and then BAM! No more distractions".

I'm glad it works for OP and he's happy with that but man that sounds like a dull life. Holy shit you just shattered the glass for me. 

I LOVE organizing. It relaxes me something fierce and I never attributed it to ADHD.  True indeed. He's the brother I never had but gosh who needs a brother when another will fill that spot! I wish I had a way to repay him, so I am open to ideas! I'm female but this is not in the least a romantic interest from either point of view. Ideas? My mind gets super attached to whatever my list is for the day and just keeps cycling through it. Even if I've crossed it all off, I'll keep mentally going over it. I hate it. 
I think routines might be amazing. I'm definitely more "successful" with them. They can be comforting in a way. Maybe I should sit down and figure out what a good day would look like for me (because it sure as heck isn't working my way through a to do list) and work that into a routine. Maybe it includes a bit of errands, a bit of work, and a good big chunk of things I like. 
I'm not sure how to work spontaneity in there. I get so paranoid that I will forget something important. My husband comes home from work and says, let's go get a drink, and it messes with the rest of my day. So yeah, most of the time, I just say, you go ahead. And I keep doing the same old boring stuff. I think probably the key is to work the fun stuff in there. If I just include all the errands, chores, and work demands, of course a to do list is going to suck. My free time isn't destructive, but it does just get sucked away into the ether while I spin my wheels. So it makes sense to structure that too. You will get back to your routine. I believe in you! That's awesome it worked so well for you! No my picture frames are my goals, I want to build a consistent routine, I want to study atleast once a day for however long at least once a day. I also want to maintain a social life since I tend to forget about it when I get hyperfocused on something, (I also struggle with answering texts/messages on time).  Thank you for the response. I personally don't think your measures are extreme. I would need and have done SOME of the things you talk about in your post.

 I always think that if I 100% committed like you did here, that I really wouldn't enjoy it anyway. I don't even think I am happy with things that "other" people are. I think my passions and the time I devote to SOME of the more productive ones are great. That sort of makes me the person I am. At a certain point, to me, I just feel like this would be cramming the biggest circle into the smallest square. Do I have to be the square?

There's much to ponder here. Thank you for this post. Have a good one. I have a good work, but it’s been a hard year.

For what it’s worth I have an uniq skill that given my this possibility.

I have no education, but could easy work anywhere.

I had a good talk with my manager and hr.
They all nice to my issues.

I work with stuff where drugs are nono.

I do however played games for 35 years, and have several stations.

I only play online on mondays(oh, now actualy sight)

I newer liked soccer or normal sports.

I been to an movie with some coowerkers last week(first time in two years)

Felt ok.

As I was bullied as kid, Im used to space in/out.
But I seem to have ok time management on it.

I newer consider social stuff, who would I do that with ? My gametime is my "free time" to just let the brain go apeshit and space out.

He might have a point, but what do in place ? My life isn't dull - it's just structured.

The structure is the skeleton of my days - I'm not living a pleasureless sterile existence where every minute is planned and accounted for with German efficiency. I have my daily hygiene, daily responsibilities, planner, to do list, literal organization of my bags and house, then my weekly activities/socializing. In between all this structure there is novelty, excitement and exploration but without the structure acting as a foundation, free time would be chaotic and destructive like it has been for me in the past.

A lot of my weekly routine is inherently fun/stimulating. I play pick up soccer, go rock climbing, play chess, handball, go to the gym, a trivia night with a lot of shouting. If I get burnt out on one of these things I'll replace it with biking, D&D, playing pool etc... 

A few of my routines seem, "extreme," from the outside, like for example weighing all my food on a scale, or using parental control apps on my phone to stop myself from going on reddit/youtube. However from my point of view, it's SO much easier than the life I was living before. I used to use ten times the mental energy trying to regulate the same behaviors, only to be mostly unsuccessful. Binge Eating, overeating, on reddit 4-12 hours a day. Now I don't even really need to think about it, I just weigh my food and literally CAN'T waste time on devices.

All the structure I've put in place was to counteract really destructive, unsustainable habits I had developed. I replaced the enjoyable/interesting/stimulating things I was doing with equivalents that are positive and beneficial. Maybe in the future I can experiment with less planning but for now, when I drop the structure it opens my personalized pandora's box of bad habits. 



 If you're going to criticize his approach, then make it constructive. What do you do to maintain a healthy balance of simulation and productivity? Because I actually agree with his approach since I personally haven't found any other way that will allow me to become successful then to create an environment in which the stimulation you get from accomplishing something isn't completely dwarfed by the stimulation you get from playing video games. It is beyond relaxing for me! It's my therapy! Lol! I myself am fond of silly awards, like “employee of the year” type stuff but personalized. Amazon has some pretty cool trophies that you could get engraved?

Omg I just found one that is a karate style person kicking the back half of a donkey - kick-ass!

Bahahahaha All I can say it your meds are clearly working wonders as it takes all my mental willpower just to be able to read a post that long let alone write one lol. I'm all for structure and planning but I also like spontaneity and I feel like if I planned everything as much as you I'd find it even harder to keep track of it all.  I wasnt directing it at OP thouhh and he seems to have it locked down and it works for him so I don't have anything to say to him. I play like 5 hours of video games a week so hardly taking up my whole life but I need something to just veg out and do when j eventually have some down time to myself. He's clearly young, single and has no kids or pets to care for though so in that situation I would have far less issues than I do currently. Oooh! Good one! Hes a get er done type. Not to mention a you're gonna get er done too type! 5 hours a week thats absolutely healthy! I wished I could actually stick to something that sustainable. Have you not had issues with indulging yourself too much? If I could maintain only 5 hours a week on video games honestly, then I would never stop. How do you keep yourself from gaming too much? I wish it were true... sadly, I am excellent at solving other people’s problems, questions and quandaries. My own? Not so much lol Boy same here!
