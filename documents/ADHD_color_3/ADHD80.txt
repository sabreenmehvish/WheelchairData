Close call getting ready for work, could have been a terrible mistake! I was about to take my add pill this morning when I accidentally grabbed a melatonin. Went to get a glass of water and realized it was the wrong color. Thank god I checked! I almost took a melatonin on my way in to work! :-o That would have been terrible! I gotta be more careful where I put those.  Melatonin isn't a sleeping pill. It's the hormone that you naturally produce at night that reminds your body to be sleepy. When you take it at night, your body is already poised to be sleepy, it's like "hmm yeah it is dark out and I've been awake for 16 hours and I had dinner awhile ago... So yeah, melatonin, good call. I will go to bed."

If you took it in the morning, your body would be like "go home, melatonin. You're drunk."  My cap for the meds is covered in coloured tape so I know!
