My reading comprehension is atrocious. I'm a 20 year old mechanical engineering student, but I can't read. I have to re-read something atleast twice because i wasn't paying attention. After that I have to read it 4 more times to figure out what it means. In most of my text books, i just skip the paragraphs and read the equations listed to understand the situation because words are hard and stuff. 

I feel like a 4 year old. doesn't help that "talk to his teacher" was one of the responses from googling "how to improve reading comprehension" 

Teach me to read, reddit. Right now i'm highlight basically every verb in this book just to give me anchor around which i can understand each sentence. PLZ HELP Hello fellow reading un-comprehender!

If you're like me, your comprehension is shit. Almost goldfish status. 

In my case, I find that highlighting, note cards, key terms and such are absolutely useless. All study methods sound like great concepts, but really don't work for me, at least.

First of all, do you have ADHD and are you medicated? 

If not medicated, you may want to consider getting there. Before medication, comprehension was zero. I tried all the tricks. The only thing I was kinda okay at was cramming and memorizing things, so that's how I survived.

Now that I'm on meds, comprehension is still shit, but it's easier to stay on task without having to re-read over and over. You also have the patience for reading, which is totally new and awesome in my opinion. The best method I've used is color-coded note-taking on the most important information. I would have never done this off meds.

But basically I color code key words or terms and use a different color to explain the concept. I feel that writing it out (even though old fashioned) is better because you're actively participating in the activity. If I have an equation, I use a different color for that and use a marker to circle it. 

Next step after the long, painstaking color coding, you have to summarize at the end. You can always summarize in sections if it's a long chapter, but this is what I've been doing and it's been working.

It's a lot of trouble, but for us goldfish, unfortunately it's the longer route we must take to absorb the information. Does your school cover disability related equipment? My student loans has a $1,300 bursary to buy [kurzveil 3000](http://www.kurzweiledu.com/products/k3000-win.html). Talk to your financial aid office and see if anything can be done. Thanks dude! I appreciate this advice! Do you have any tips for if I'm not on meds (other than "get meds")? Yeah! Np! Glad it could kind of help :) Well, like I said. I got by through by memorizing and cramming. That was my only solution at the time. Everything else felt like a huge bother and waste of time.

However, here are some ideas and methods I used before my diagnosis:

**1. Use a white board.** If you are a tactile learner and you hate the thought of paper and pen, this is a great way to be actively involved. As you read, you can write down important points from the text. After you finish the section, go back through the white board and see if you understand it. Take a picture of it if you have to. Next, wipe it off and re-write it via memory.

The other neat thing with white boards is that you can doodle to help you remember better.
Here are some examples of what I did in undergrad.

**2. Get a colored, transparency film.** This is something I learned in a speed reading class way back. It's best if the projector sheet is colored so you have a better time following along and it's best if you use a transparent sheet so you know how much reading you have left. A little hard to explain, but I'll try.

Take the sheet and cover all the text so that the top of the sheet is on the sentence you are reading. As you read and go down the page, you move the sheet. So basically, the top of the transparent film will **always** be on the sentence you are reading, kind of like a highlighter.

Another neat thing is you can write on the film with a transparency film marker and that essentially makes note taking *a little* more fun.

**3. Write on your book.** Since OP is clearly not afraid of marking up his textbook, this might work. Instead of highlighting those verbs, try to read one sentence at a time. If you find something important, write down that key word in the margin. Or if it's your thing, draw a small doodle that means the same thing as the keyword. The point of the key word is to remind you what you did in hopes that you will have an easier time recalling what you read.

However, if you are afraid of marking up your book, you can use post-it notes. Write the keywords or doodles on the post-it and adhere it to the page. The nicer thing about post-its is that you can easily find the page you marked up later.

**4. Make up stupid stories or mnemonics.** Seriously, it works. If you're having particular trouble with memorizing something, surround the thing in a dumb story. Insert name calling, expletives, swear words, anything that's out of the ordinary that will help you remember during the test.

For example, say I need to know that B.F. Skinner created the Skinner box and he believed children learned language solely through reinforcement.

Story: Skinner came up with this stupid box. He put pigeons in this box and make them push stupid buttons so they'd get some motherfucking food. Birds like motherfucking food. He thought kids learned how to talk just like these dumbass pigeons. Only by getting some reward, like a cookie ... mmm ... cookies ... then the kid would say certain words more often in the future.

A *very* bad example, but you kinda get the gist. It's an extremely stupid story.

**5. Invest in an app that will read your text if you have it in digital form.** This is actually something I found on this subreddit and I'm anxious to try it out. It's worth it as an ADHD-er because we compulsively must do other things while doing our boring tasks. Check out Audible on the Google Play store or Voice Dream for iPhone.

**6. Break up the reading.** Yeah, it's hard to even get started on reading until the last minute, but it's totally manageable if you break up your readings into parts. Preferably, you would *not* wait until the day before to begin.

So the way I do it right now is break up my readings into 30% sections. Say I need to read a 20 page chapter. That's 6 pages per section. On a sheet of paper, I would write down ...
(1-6), (7-13), (14-20)
As I complete each section, I take the time to summarize what I just read on a sheet of paper. Next, I draw myself a star under the section I completed, cause I love immediate reinforcement. After that, I take a short 10-15 minute break and then go back to do the next section and so on.

If you have a friend or family member that doesn't mind, you can always make this into an accountability session. Summarize each section to them. They give you the star. Make them hold onto a bag of candy and when you are entirely finished with your reading and you have provided summaries on all sections, you get a piece or two.

**7. Color code your notes.** You can always go ahead and color code your notes, but I understand that it's a bit hard when your brain is already un-organized as it is. 

But just to give you an idea of what color coding means to me ...

That's all I can think of for now. I'd be happy to answer any other study habit questions. Hey, that's actually really nice, thanks! :) You're welcome! Hopefully it helps a bit. Good luck! :)
