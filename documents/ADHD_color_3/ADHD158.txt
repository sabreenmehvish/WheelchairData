Did anyone experience a difference in ability to recognize faces once you started on medication? Seeing a post on this subreddit four months ago led me to meet a psychiatrist and get diagnosed. Thanks everyone!

Over the last month, I have noticed a dramatic change in how I notice people. I can recognize and remember faces! I honestly thought people were exaggerating when they talked about similarities between people's faces because all faces looked pretty much identical to me.

It's like I couldn't even focus on faces long enough to see nose shapes or eye colors or anything. Until now, when I'm not on meds, I identify people by their walk, smell, voices, overall body size and not from their faces.

Also, people have so many expressions? I'm get a little freaked out by how much some people smile/move their brows/move their eyelids... I don't know how I used to miss that

It's such a big change to me and it's confusing. I'm used to being the awkward friend and everyone around me would describe me as introverted but no one told me something was wrong with me. I'm generally successful and I think because I'm smart in math/science/tech I got away with it.

What I really want to know is if anyone else experienced something like this and I would appreciate some recommendations/tips. If it matters, I'm a 25 year old woman working as a backend dev.

&#x200B; Interesting. I am very bad at recognising / remembering faces, too!  I'm so so bad at remembering names. I never forget a face. In fact I can even recognise a person way off in the distance just by seeing their body shape and movement.

But if I haven't spoken to someone in a while,  chances are I won't remember their name. Unless it's family or close friend.

Since I'm on meds it's a tad better. I do have to add that I'm on natural supplements, since regular meds works for shit on me ðŸ¤£
