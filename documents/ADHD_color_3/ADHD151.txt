Yesterday I was officially put on a "Development Plan." Hey, y'all.  I hate to be a bother, but I'm in need of some advice or maybe just some commiseration.  I had sort of known this day was coming.  About three and a half weeks ago, my supervisor told me they were preparing a "development plan" for me (which is the step they take before they fire you - think of it as a "last chance" sort of thing) because I've been "distracted" lately and it's showing in my work.  I got irritated, because they knew I was working on trying to get the correct dosage for new medication, and I told them they didn't give me as strong a dose as I needed.  Not only that, but I had issues getting an appointment, so there were several days where I went without any medication at all.  But I went in to talk to my doc, got a higher dose (I had the appointment set anyway), and buckled down at work.  I utilized a couple of coping mechanisms my doctor suggested, and things got better on my end.  After three and a half weeks without any mention of the plan again, I thought I was in the clear.  I thought I had sufficiently impressed them.  I was preforming better than I ever had, and they told me as such!

So color me shocked when my supervisor placed the official plan in front of me yesterday.  I have thirty days to "improve" ("Really!  We just need to see that you'll sustain these new improvements! And if you do, we'll just make you do another thirty days to make sure of it!"). 

I don't know what to do.  Do y'all have any coping mechanisms?  Has something like this happened to you?    Hang in there and stay strong. While you're working keep all distraction away from you. Cell phone in drawer stay away from social media at all cost. At the beginning of the shift make a list of the goals you need to accomplish and stayed focused on that. If one thing on the list is taking to long to finish move onto the next item.  It's very easy to get hyperfocused and spend way to much time on one task. 1-2 hrs before the shift ends go back to the skipped items.

To me it sound like, because they know you have a disability they are trying to move you out. The only way they can do it without lawsuits is the "development plan". Personally i don't tell employers about my add because of all the bogus stigmas associated with it.

With all that said i would recommend looking for a new job as security measures in case they do fire you at the end of the "dev plan". But don't look while you're at work use your own time to do this. Again stay strong and focused on your daily goals. Best of luck to you! Generally, when people are put on development plans, that‚Äôs the polite way of the business saying ‚Äúgo find a new job‚Äù.  They‚Äôre not interested in you succeeding at meeting/beating the plan, they‚Äôre just doing the paperwork to cover their asses.

Go find a new gig instead of killing yourself trying to please people who have already written you off. You're never in the clear with a PIP. As others have said, it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to clean up the resume and send it around to places. 

That being said, it isn‚Äôt over till it‚Äôs over. It sounds like things have been getting better. Keep it up! Continue to do well and go above/beyond when you can. They started the process of making a development plan, corporate things like this take time, so it‚Äôs not crazy that you still got the plan even though you‚Äôve been improving. 

From a company standpoint, think about it like this. They don‚Äôt know you, this isn‚Äôt personal, you‚Äôre a number on a sheet. They see your improvement and the positive feedback should be taken as a very good sign. But they want to prepare themselves in case you aren‚Äôt able to continue the progress. It‚Äôs easy to take you off the development plan, it‚Äôs a lot harder to get everything rolling on it. 

Try not to overthink it. Yes it‚Äôll be on the back of your mind but just focus on continuing the good work. And at your 30 day meeting, get the feedback and let them know: hey, I fully understand that I was not living up to the standards expected of me and that this plan is a reflection of that. But I hope my recent performance reflects my determination to not let my personal struggles negatively affect my professionalism or this company. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to prove my abilities and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing this progress. Please let me know if there are any areas that you think I can work on and I will do my best to go above and beyond your expectations. 

Now if the company has made up its mind to let you go and this plan is just a sham to make them not liable. Well accept it with grace and use it as a learning experience. Sometimes people have to fail in order to succeed in the future and this job does not define you. Even if it takes this job or 10 more to find a place that fits. Just keep moving forward! Stay positive! Start looking for a new job and don't tell your next employer about your medication dosage issues or appointment issues. They just sound like excuses to them. So you are going through the medication adjustments phase, work knows about this, and your disordr, and they pull this off, after two years with this company...

Sounds like they don't have either an informed HR department. Or they are "making it up" as they go along. I say this because they clearly don't understand what ADHD is. 

Personally I'd do my best if this job was my only option, and my family depended upon me and this job. 

**BUT**

If I had other options, I'd be looking to find another job (or a re-evaluation of the whole circumstance). An additional 60 day of "walking a razors edge" isn't the place I'd tolerate being if I absolutely didn't have to be in that position. They aren't helping you, they are setting the stage to legally end your employment.

**SEEK LEGAL ADVICE** **Sooner than later**

Even if they aren't trying to treat you improperly, having appropriate advice and clarity on your situation is VASTLY better than asking us for help.

Your region has to have some form of "employment standards" and/or "disability rights" services for workers. Go find out.

Good luck

TL;DR 

**GO FIND A LAWYER** Quit and start looking for a new job asap.  PIP means you are out of there most likely. Yeah, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever tell another employer about my ADHD. I just figured after almost two years that it would be okay. I kind of also felt that I should give them a reason for why I needed to go the the doctors, which I now know I absolutely do not need to do.

I‚Äôll put my all into keeping this job, but I‚Äôm also going to prepare for the worst and get my resume ready and out there. Thank you so much for your advice! Especially about the phone! Oddly enough, I never thought about that! It might make my filing kind of boring (I listen to podcasts during that time) but if that‚Äôs the price I have to pay... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sorry, a PIP? Thank you for your advice! I greatly appreciate it. I kind of think it‚Äôs a little more personal than just a ‚Äúnumber on a sheet‚Äù since our division is so small, and I work closely with everyone (I work in local government). But I‚Äôm definitely going to start sending my resume out again, even if this all goes away in sixty days (since the reward for doing well in this case means getting another 30 day dev plan üôÑ). 

It just blows my mind that they knew I was having issues that I was actively fixing, and they‚Äôre reacting this way. I‚Äôm consistently the person in our office who‚Äôs flexible and a ‚Äúteam player‚Äù when most of the other folks aren‚Äôt. I mean, this was in no way my dream job, and I wasn‚Äôt planning to stay there too long after I finish grad school next May, but it still kind of sucks. üòî I was in a bad accident. My pickup truck rolled over with my two small kids strapped in the back seat. My boss rushed me to come back to work 2 days later. Employers care about your out put. You are being fired. Reach out to recruiters. Get out there and interview. You will owe your job in less than 2 months. Sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. I was diagnosed with add a few months ago. I‚Äôve since started my own business. I don‚Äôt have the pressure or the bs from an employer. I help people. Performance improvement plan. And yes, you aren't. PIP is just the paperwork before getting fired. Start finding another job. Sorry.. I know this feels horrible but you will get through it! Performance Improvement Plan.

Do the best you can in a standard allotment of time. Don't go beyond, e.g., 40hrs/wk and put your focus on job hunting. Try to have a new job lined up for the 30 day mark. Totally understand. And I don‚Äôt mean it in the sense that your coworkers and bosses don‚Äôt think of you as an individual. I meant it that from a company standpoint‚Äîand especially government. There is a certain criteria for performance and unfortunately in a capitalist society, money is that criteria. Cost vs reward. Bob can be a great person, his bosses and coworkers love him. But when the higher higher ups look at their reviews, if bob isn‚Äôt producing enough to justify his pay, bob will be cast aside no matter what hardships he has. It‚Äôs sounds cynical but it‚Äôs a cold world in the professional world. 
You have to treat your job as you would the friend who you live hanging out with but wouldn‚Äôt count on to keep your darkest secret or be there to answer your call in the muddle of the night. You want to be close but never have your guard down. 

But I‚Äôm glad you found some of this helpful. I have a decent amount of corporate experience and that‚Äôs why I say to really not write off that positive feedback or to take the plan extremely personally. Your managers could very much want you to succeed but their hands may be tied and need to follow procedure in giving you the development plan. Again, especially a govt position where rules are stricter. Imo, the fact they even gave you one is proof they don‚Äôt want to lose you but felt you needed to know the stakes. If they really hated you or your performance, they probably could have fired you with no plan. 

If you‚Äôre lost at sea and a ship throws you a life jacket, it‚Äôs not because they think you can‚Äôt swim, it‚Äôs because they want to keep you from drowning I figured... They were making a bit of a show of saying they want to keep me. üòî Thank you.  I‚Äôve got a part time gig I‚Äôm doing for one of my professors that will last through September, so I‚Äôve got that covered a little bit.

Thank you for your advice! I greatly appreciate the time you took to answer my question. If you need help brushing up on your interview skills, reach out to me. I‚Äôm a Public Speaking expert. I help motivated people improve their presentation skills. I love my work. My work is my life‚Äôs purpose. This happened to me. It was awful, and I'm sorry you're going through it. There are literally HR industry message boards that are all about getting rid of people with ADHD using legal "non-discriminatory" means.

So this is publishing/ecommerce/design specific, but one thing I did during the before-the-axing job hunt was use lunch breaks to put together a portfolio of work I did for the company, like graphics and copy that I made. Just to be safe, I did it surreptitiously and put it all on a USB in case future employers wanted to see my work. If you have created any assets, I would make copies to keep for yourself, or at least take physical copies of finished publications with you. What message boards do you speak of?

HR is evil and does not give a shit about employees. They definitely aren't there to protect you, they're there for the organization. It's right there in the name: Human Resources.

I did a lot of webcrawling years ago after my diagnosis, and I think a little googling can come up with it, but I don't recall the exact sites I visited.

Funny thing is now I'm kind of open at my new job (I'm about to begin my 2nd year teaching), and that honesty plus an OVERWHELMING earnestness in taking notes at meetings and checking to see if I'm getting details correct, asking for advice in classroom management techniques, etc got me out of Special Education and into the position I wanted in General Education (which is almost impossible to transition to once you've taught SpEd). I'm still a little nervous about it, but Education is pretty different from Ecommerce. That being said, it's whole hell of a lot more satisfying to me.
