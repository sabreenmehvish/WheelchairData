How to keep track of homework If you're anything like me, you're probably the type of person that sucks at remembering what homework you have to do and when it's due. Lucky for you, I finally figured out a pretty good solution to keeping track of all the work I have to do:

&#x200B;

Step one: Make sure you get the course syllabus for each of your classes

Step two: Open up a word document and search through the templates until you find one that you can edit into a type of to-do list (I'm using the "5-day trip planner" template on Microsoft Word Online

Step three: Edit your template title to the dates for the whole week (Example: Sept. 17 - Sept. 21)

Step four: Write what class is on that day, what homework you have for that class, and what day the homework is due by

Step five: Once you figure out what day the homework is due, skip over to the section of the due date and write in a different color that the homework is due today

If you want to do this for the whole year, get a calendar template for a more detailed homework schedule. I hope this helps everyone this school year! (For more details, comment below!)

TL;DR - If you forget homework easily, open a word document and write all the homework you have for the week and just keep editing every week Good plan, what I do is I have a sticky note app on my computer that is always in the upper right corner of the screen and write down the assignments for the week, when I finish them(even if they are done early) I immediately replace it with the next assignment due for the class.
