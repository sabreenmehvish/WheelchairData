New Diagnosis - Ritalin is a heck-of-a-drug Hey everyone, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple days ago I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist to get tested for ADD/ADHD, which I "passed" with flying colors (very ADD colors). I was prescribed Ritalin (10mg twice per day) as a starting point, with the idea that I would be stepped up slowly to find what medication works best for me. I'm a little late to the game (mid 20's now), grew up in a household that was VERY scared of prescription drugs and in complete denial that ADD/ADHD was even a real thing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back before medication, most of my work was done in little "sprints" I called them. Same thing for hobbies, studying, etc. Focus for a couple seconds, maybe a minute or two if I was lucky, then get distracted and my body either would go on autopilot or I would just stop what I was doing and follow the fresh new trail of thoughts in my head. Most often, it was just my own thoughts that just threw me in a completely different direction then I wanted to go. This made listening, reading, and writing all very difficult for me. Cs and Ds in school were my bread and butter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first two or three hours on 10mgs of Ritalin was great. I found I could maintain focus on a task for up to 15 minutes. That was huge for me. I already had gotten pretty good at accomplishing a lot with a few seconds (something something, that's what she said), but being able to focus for 5-15 minutes "sprints" instead of 5-60 second ones let me do two days worth of my normal work in an hour. The only real downside was fidgeting. I don't think I had never fidgeted or had any physical tells of ADD/ADHD before. I bite my nails (kinda badly) and fidgeted fingers a little from time to time, but I was a pretty calm kid, but the whole time I kept bouncing my legs or tapping my feet. Not that bad, from what I've read I'm pretty lucky that was the only side effect. The second day however was much less ideal. Barely even felt the Ritalin. Third day didn't even feel it at all. Bummer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brings me to question time. Have any of you had similar experiences on Ritalin? Similar side effects? I've read that increased fidgeting may mean that I don't actually have ADD/ADHD. Now I'm on the fence, maybe my inability to focus IS caused by something else, maybe it's just how I am? No clue, am definitely not a doctor, and am definitely not good at psychoanalyzing myself. I have a followup appointment with my psychiatrist in a couple weeks now, but I'd love to get more opinions to have something to compare the doctor's to.

 The euphoria you feel from first trying methylphenidate and realising what's possible is not the same as the effects of the drug. The first time I took it, I tidied my house and did a ton of work. After a few days, you're left with the ability to focus but you won't feel the same rush - that's fine. The point of the drug is to let you focus, not to give you a rush and motivation to do stuff.

Chasing that rush will put you on higher and higher doses until it becomes unsafe. Trust that the drugs are working, even if you can't 'feel' them.  I don’t take anything anymore. i took Ritalin as a kid and got prescribed the heavy stuff - because the normal ones were not cutting it. be VERY careful upping your doses. I ended up taking a heavier mg variant and started falling asleep/feeling worthless. speak to your doctor!  I agree with UnsortedUnfinished. Today was my third day on Ritalin and I'm having pretty much the same experience as you, but no fidgeting; I'm actually much more mellow, so much so that I can almost instantly tell when I need to take my next dose for the day. Wait a little longer, trust the medicine, trust the doctor. Also, nice joke. I have a question: I’m on methylphenidate too. My doc said that on the weekends, I don’t have to take it if I don’t want to - that if I don’t have to work, I can just skip the med. However, there are symptoms other than productivity that I feel it helps with (like anxiety, brain fog etc).  

Do you skip on weekends, or take everyday?  Might be kind of personal question here, but have you chased the rush in the past? If so, how did it end up? Regardless, super appreciative of the advice. This shit legit scares me, especially bigger drugs like adderall and vyvanse. Totally. This makes huge sense and I'm definitely going to bring it up when I go in next. It's nice to hear people are careful with these drugs. Especially with what the media says about them (and ADD/ADHD) these days. Thanks! Lol, glad someone caught it. It was buried in a wall of text so good find. I skip days when I want to drink. I find the alcohol helps the anxiety anyway. If I wanted to be productive on a weekend day, I'd take it. don’t worry about it :-)
