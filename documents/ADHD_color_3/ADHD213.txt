Procrastinated laundry and packing until the night before I leave. Felt good when I finished until I looked at the clock lol I knew tommorow was coming for weeks. A trip North a few hours to spend the weekend with my girlfriend whom I haven't seen in a long time, to play DND with her friend circle. Instead of planning out what I needed to bring ahead of time, I decided tonight was the night to finish ALL of my laundry. If any of you are like me, doing laundry is a 4-5+ hour commitment. Started with just what I needed for tomorrow but turned into all my nice clothes, all my reds, all my darks, and then when I got tired of color coding and organizing I threw the rest of the clothes unassorted. Luckily having nicer clothes gives me an excuse to air dry, or rather throw all of it anywhere it can hang and not actually immediately put them away like a normal human. I'm also using this time to pack and remember what I need. 

It wouldn't be so bad if I were to do this the day before, but 3am into the night before, where I have to wake up at 7am to go to chemo for my mom and then start the 3 hour drive North. I didn't even realize what time it was the entire time. Sigh. I actually get my results for my ADHD screening tomorrow before I leave. I'm nervous. Pretty sure I have it but if I don't I can look back at this post and at least for sure know if I'm really a lazy sack of shit who can't keep time or if it's just a little faulty wiring. Haha I do this too, when it comes to chores procrasting is my favourite ðŸ¤£
