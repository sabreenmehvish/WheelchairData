I've probably gotten a lot bigger because of my ADHD and not being able to keep count of my reps in the gym... This just came to my mind after three unsuccessful attempts to count to 12. If I forget what number Iâ€™m at Iâ€™ll always round down rather than up so that Ill have done more reps rather than less than I was meant to lol - 1..2..3.. but then if I buy ... fuck!....1..2..3.. 

I can so relate! Maybe use a hand held clicker? Or a partner? Or just get super fit, yay ADHD! ðŸ˜‚ i know exactly what u mean about forgetting your count. However i dont do more than 8-10 reps and i always go to failure. if im doing more than that in qty of reps i increase the weight. So I'm not the only one! same! that's the spirit!!!  same! that's the spirit!!!  RIPPED AF IT IS!!! ha!
