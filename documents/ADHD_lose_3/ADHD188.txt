It took me 3 months to pick up my contacts. TL:DR - how do I make myself do things in a timely fashion?  I *want* to do these things, I know that they're important, they're not hard, and I don't necessarily forget that I need to do them, I just can't summon the ability to actually do them until I'm under pressure.  Calendar reminders are useless; I just snooze and eventually ignore them, then the to-do item slips my mind and I forget about it until I'm confronted with some kind of consequence. 

* So I went in mid-December for an eye exam and ordered contacts because I was on my last pair.  The contacts were in the store for pickup on December 27th and I picked them up YESTERDAY.  I've been wearing a pair of monthly contacts for 3.5 months because I'm apparently too lazy to function as a competent adult.   I *knew* that I needed to pick them up.  The optical shop is <5 minutes from my office.   I've gone to the Costco next to the shop at least a half dozen times in the last 3 months and each time I said to myself, "Hmmm, I really should stop and get my contacts."  I even created a to-do in my work Outlook calendar - which I promptly ignored.  I didn't actually get the things until my old contacts were so hard/non-permeable that my eyes were watering non-stop.

* I have an at-home test kit for my workplace wellness program that has been sitting on the mantel for 2 months.  It'll take me all of 2 minutes to do the test and I can drop it off at a FedEx box on my way to work; the effort required is not high, but I need to have it done and postmarked by next Friday or I'll lose out on free money in our HSA.   Again, I made several Outlook reminders for this, but I just snooze and eventually ignore them. 

* I have a stack of work at my job that I've allowed to pile up.  All boring, rote, thankless tasks without immediate or firm due dates, so the sort of thing that's impossible to motivate myself to finish until my boss reminds me about a deadline.  Then I end up in "oh shit" mode and have to take work home and stress that they're going to realize how lazy I am/how much more productive I could be.  

* I need to schedule dental checkups/cleanings for our kids, who are overdue.  I keep saying to myself every morning, "I really ought to call today" and then I don't.  Their dentist has sent two reminder texts and a letter!  Is it going to take one of them having a painful cavity to motivate me to get off my ass and do it?   I feel like such a crappy mother.  

Why can I impulsively go on Amazon and drop $150 on hobby supplies without a second thought, yet it's so hard for me to do necessary-but-mundane tasks in a timely fashion?   I can sit there on the couch and do two hours of cross-stitch, but I can't make a 2 minute phone call to set up dentist appointments for my children.    Procrastinating on everything is a horrible way to live, but it's the only way I've ever gotten anything done.  :(  
 I was supposed to get my eyes checked out by a specialist 2 years ago for a potential future retina detachment.

I still haven't gone :) I make a lot of lists and block off a time every week to do them. I am a million times better at this since I went back on medication. If I don’t put it in the list right when I find out about it, it never happens. My property taxes have been past due for two months....

And I am also a crap mother who forgets her kids dental appointments. Went to get contacts fitted around 2013. Didnt work out. Said i would get back in a month. 2017 finally got contacts. Got a new prescription for eyes around September? October? Still have yet to order glasses to update my old ones. That's a good idea. Thats going on the todo list right now. I relate with this so hard. All of it. No useful advice, but you aren’t alone in feeling like a crap mom.  So, posting this was embarrassing enough that I picked up the phone and at least made the kids' dentist appointments.   I put it on the Google Calendar and blocked it in Outlook at work.   Thanks to your post I just realized I haven't gone and picked up my library card from the library... that I accidentally left behind... and they called me last September letting me know I can come pick it up I honestly wish I could tell you but I just picked up my blood pressure medication because the pharmacy kept texting me counting down the days it would be until they returned it.  I am just like you.  I tell myself I need to do this and then go home get sidetracked and completely forget about it.  Well, that and the pharmacy I use closes a lot earlier than most so I often say forget it and I'll go tomorrow.  But you know that never happens. That's quite serious. Ninja had that happen to him. You should really go, it can lead to permanent blindness.
