How do I lose weight when ADHD works so hard against it? This may sound weird, but I'll try to make sense of it:

I am overweight and I want to lose weight. Mostly because I want to feel better, but also for health reasons. 

Now, I know how to do it: Eat healthy and on the same times every day, go outside, do sports etc. 
But I can't do any of these things. 

I always forget to eat something and then I get all shaky and just eat the first thing that comes into my hands (which is most likely *not* healthy). And even if I remember, cooking is so much work and I get distracted during it.

I try to find a sport I would like, but I can't get started on any new things. 

I can't stick to a schedule in any way if I am not forced to. 

And especially when I'm feeling down, I will grab chocolate or chips because they give this short dopamine rush, you know?


Do any of you guys have tips on how I can get started? One thing I found was just making sure that there were not unhealthy snacks in my flat.  Switch over to more healthy things to stock your fridge or cupboards with.  Fruit, for one.

Another thing is re-aligning what you think of as a "portion" - one of the things I did was change how much I felt "lunch" was worth.  I was used to two sandwiches (i.e. four slices of bread plus fillings).  So I switched to one - half as much.  

For cooking, I cook eight meals at one time, which is not that much harder than making one just with more materials, and put 'em all in plastic tubs.  That way most of the time I'm reheating things from the freezer intead of cooking from scratch every day.

Don't try and change everything all at once - make small, incremental changes that you can stick to.  Don't "go on a diet", *change* your diet. I actually have some advice for this post (for once). Focus on One. Thing. At. A. Time. Probably start with food, because that will make the fastest, biggest difference. I highly recommend learning to cook, because you can make your food so much more nutritious than a factory ever will. But only do one thing at a time. Maybe learn to cook one or two healthy breakfast options for yourself, and focus on that alone for a few months, until it becomes easy and habitual. 

Several years ago I made a New Year's resolution to eat a fresh fruit or vegetable at every meal, and it's now been my resolution every year since, because it's taken me that long to make it habitual. But now it is habitual. Every time I go to the store, produce is way more than half my cart. This year, I refined it to eating more greens specifically. It means that I meal prep my work lunches and snacks (that habit took a LONG time to get good and regular). At this point, I feel really, really good about my diet. I also feel damn fine about eating junk food when I want to because 80-90% of my diet is so healthy and clean. I feel so much better after I eat now, that going back to pre-resolution habits is not even tempting.

Now, exercise for me is much harder, and will probably be another years-long resolution process. But yeah--one thing at a time.

Generally, IMO, don't try to do a quick fix on your body. Go slow and build rock-solid habits that will stay with you for a lifetime.      Losing weight is a big challenge, and doing it properly is difficult for many people. What makes it hard for people with ADHD is that it is a lifestyle change. You have to make a choice, a hard choice, one that is harder for people with ADHD than it is for others, and that choice is to change. It is further complicated by the fact that we inherently seek quick results, more so than other people. This is our great weakness.

It's not enough to know you want to lose weight. It's not enough to want to change. It's not enough when you get discouraged and quit. You have to make it a part of who you are. Healthy living is a daily choice. Something you choose for yourself because being unhealthy is something you don't want to do. That is the mindset you will need for what very well could be the rest of your life.

Secondly, there's something you want to attain. It's your mission, something you want to achieve in order to be more than you are. It's self-actualization. Who do you want to BECOME. It's not just about losing weight. Losing weight is a footnote. You need to know what your true mission is before you will succeed here.

Once you know where your fitness goal fits into your mission, you can break down the steps you need to get there. One small change at a time. It'll be tempting to do them all at once, or even several at once. But that is a recipe for failure. Pick ONE thing on that list.

Examples of broad, poorly defined, and/or difficult goals: "Eat healthier", "Prepare all of my meals every day", "Exercise more often". These aren't going to push you to success, they are parts of a machine, and like all machines, they have smaller components that support them and make them work.

Better goals: "Drink only water, tea, and coffee without sweetners or additives", "Go for a walk everytime I go on break at work", "Prepare my lunch for work in the morning/evening so I don't eat fast food at lunch."

Once you've picked a more specific task, (it may not be specific enough, and you may find that an even smaller goal is needed, that's fine!), what do you NEED in order to SUCCEED? Do you need water bottles at your desk? Buy them. Do you need convenience? Maybe disposable bottles of water are better, so you can just grab one (buy A LOT). Do you need to throw out stuff? Do it. Do you need disposable flatware and whatnot for your lunches because you don't do dishes or clean your Tupperware? BUY THAT CRAP. Find out all of the things you NEED to be successful and eliminate excuses for that ONE SMALL GOAL, and execute them a little bit at a time.

That's the key, a little bit at a time.
One day, you buy a few hundred water bottles and put them where it's convenient for you (For me, it's by the couch in a big stack so I don't have to go to the kitchen where I might be tempted). Maybe over the next few days you get a reusable one at work, or you reuse one of your disposable bottles a few times, and you start drinking water at work. Will you slip up? Sure, and when you do, DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. Instead, what caused you to make that choice? If it was a circumstance or situation, find a way to mitigate it so you can stick to your goal.

Every day, it gets easier and easier and easier. Once you go 30 days without slipping then you go on to the next micro-goal. Keep track, put up a chart that has a list, and a bunch of boxes you can check if you successfully met your micro-goal that day. Add the next small item to the list. Figure out what you need. Execute, execute, execute. All of a sudden you have a formula for successfully building new habits, months go by, and you have new habits that support your broader goal of losing weight.

Maybe you want to start an exercise program. Look at your time objectively, see where you can be consistent and find what you need to start. Remember, micro goals. Walking during your breaks. Going for a walk when you get home. Etc. Once you get consistent (30 days) build it up. I'm going to run once a week instead of walking. Eventually, you start running every day. 

Microgoals. If those are too big, break it down so you perform the pre-behaviors. Get your shoes on, and walk up to your front door. Do that for a week, then escalate, put your shoes on, walk up  to the door, go outside and stand there for 5 minutes. Do that for a week, then escalate again, walk around the block. So that for a week and escalate again, etc etc etc. 

After a year, you'll be surprised at what you can accomplish.


 I have never been able to sustain any form of exercise where the exercise was the point of the activity, and I love food so much I will never adhere to any “diet” that requires me to eliminate any food or food group. 

What finally worked for me (I’ve lost 45lbs since July) was leaning into the aspects of my ADHD that had the potential to actually be helpful if I did them with more intentionality.  

1: hyper- focus. 
I can get sucked into my phone and accidentally lose hours of the day. I know I will do this no matter what. So, instead of trying to put down my phone and “go to the gym” I rearranged my living room so that I can pace easily without bumping into anything. Now, when I take out my phone to get sucked into a reddit rabbit hole, I start pacing. 15 gif recipes, 5 panda videos and half an hour of Candy Crush later I’ve racked up 11,000 steps on my Fitbit, and I didn’t even notice because I wasn’t “exercising” I was focusing on my distracting tech gadget.

2: procrastination 
In high school, the only time I ever cleaned my room was if I had a major exam or essay to do. I would always use the formerly undesirable chore as an excuse to rationalize my way out of doing the even more undesirable homework. Now that I’m an adult teacher i still have the same tendency to incorrectly prioritize deadlines. Case in point: today is a teacher work day and I’m supposed to be grading. Instead I am pacing around my classroom staring at my phone giving weight loss advice to an ADHD stranger on reddit. So I’ll tell myself “I’ll just come in on Saturday and finish. But tomorrow I’ll decide that the day would be better spent intricately planning and preparing freezer meals for the next three weeks. So I’ll tell myself to get it done on Sunday, but I’ll hear that a friend is going on a hike and even though I hate exercising on purpose I’ll decide that I need to get outdoors. I’ll finally do the grading in an absolute panic from 11:00-3:00am Sunday night. 

3: fidgeting. 
I remember noticing that if I bounced around and drummed on my steering wheel in the car, my Fitbit recorded it as activity. At first I thought “well that doesn’t count, stupid Fitbit” but then I realized that my Fitbit measures heart rate. Even if what I was doing wasn’t “walking” it still got my heart rate up, and that’s the whole point. Your body doesn’t know what movements count as a categorizable “exercise” it just knows that you’re moving. 


4: medication side effects. 
I’m not hungry when I’m medicated. I’ll eat everything in sight when I’m not. Enter r/intermittentfasting 

5: loop back to #1
If I’m going to hyperfocus, why not hyperfocus on pages like r/loseit 

Anyway... I’ve been walking and writing this post for 45 minutes and my Fitbit says that’s about 6,000 calories. My classroom is still a shitshow and I haven’t graded a thing, but at least I’ve been waking this whole time, and last year I would have been in the same situation but the reason would have been a lot less active. 
 I stuggled with my weight for years. Constantly putting on and losing 10-20lbs before finally reaching about 250lbs.

I went vegan and lost ~80lbs in a year. There was no willpower necessary. I watched a few documentaries and once I realised what was happening unnecessarily there was no going back (I had never really thought about it before - wish I had). Our connection/hyper-empathy with animals due to the 'hunter-brain' theory makes it really easy. (The hard part is realising most people really just don't care - it made me feel even more separated and different from society) I got my blood tested a few weeks ago, perfect. Was able to stop taking my medication for EDS (joint pain and heartburn) and I'm in the best shape of my life now.

I take no supplements, just sprinkle b12 fortified nutritional yeast on everything since its so tasty Here's some slightly different advice in addition to all the things mentioned so far...have you tried frozen meals? They really have come a long way since 1970's era TV dinners. My son is the same as you, cooking takes too much effort and focus once he gets hungry enough to trigger the motivation to actually find some food. He would eat junk like Hot Pockets and Pizza Rolls almost every day. I got him some Luvo Bowls and he loves them. They're quite tasty, fast and easy. I feel a lot better that he's at least getting some veggies. Another plus is that they have built in portion control.  I always thought the way to eat healthy was to meal prep and make sure I had veggies on hand all the time and eat lots of small meals. But of course ADHD and seriously, who has time for that??

My most recent nutritionist helped a lot by recommending that I concentrate on getting protein in, eating at regular times, and taking multivitamins. My worst meal was always lunch because I'd get caught up in work and just not eat.. then be ravenous at dinner. Or, I'd not have enough for breakfast and go out for a huge lunch.

Now I have a protein shake for lunch (15g of protein or more), and/or a protein bar, and I set an alarm for it. I have eggs every morning for breakfast, with a slice of toast because we do need *some* carbs. If I need a snack, I have small containers of nuts or baby carrots or babybel cheese I can grab. No thinking or prep required.

I've lost 12% of my body weight so far, so it seems to be working! Can you commit to the “7 Day Trial Phase” of a diet or exercise regime? Someone suggested it to me for a problem similar to yours — and it worked. Simple concept, but for us sometimes simplest isn’t the most obvious! ;)

The theory is that being able to see actual progress and feel an actual sense of completion are the only true way for people who have trouble motivating themselves is to self-motivate in small blocks. 7 days may seem like a long time right now, but just remember how quickly a week passes. At the end of 7 days, if you stick to any goal, you WILL see/notice/feel a difference. 7 days won’t have you in shape, but you’ll likely notice some sort of difference in your appearance...even if it’s only the loss of one or two pounds, or the fact that you feel better when you wake up or look healthier and more alert when you look in the mirror. That helps you prove to yourself that you can make the positive change that you want — because you’re seeing/feeling it! And mentally, the sense of getting to the 7-day mark for the first time is truly motivating and proves to you that you can definitely do it :) 

This works for every thing/goal that you want to achieve or get better at. It definitely works for me. It’s not a perfect system — I have not successfully made it to the 7 day mark every time. But I have proven to myself that if I put my mind to it, I can achieve something just by chopping it up into manageable blocks :)

Congrats on wanting to improve your health. I know it’s harder with ADHD, but you can definitely do this, dude!

Best of luck 😁

Edit: autocorrect took my words and eff’d with them. I enjoyed tracking my food on MyFitnessPal, it gave me a rush knowing I was still under my daily caloric intake, it gave me a rush if I was miles below and could eat chocolate, and it gave me a reason to say no when I was too close to going over (you can't persuade numbers). All I know is that I’ve had a fat pregnant-looking tummy since I was *eight* for crying out loud :( Never lived a normal life, and now I know from something else that has nothing to do with ADHD, I never will. Still, I wonder what it’s like to be one of those many millions and millions of ordinary women in society, to able to have a flirtatious life, feel comfortable enough to have sex with a guy who won’t feel repulsed, or pose with a nice body, or feel sexy naked etc. (yeah I know people have their own insecurities, but you know what I mean). Oh whatever, I’ve never sounded so petty and insecure so let me stop there haha. I’m personally going to diet by eating plant foods and cutting out meat a lot, and exercising 4x a week as my friend is doing. Hopefully then I can feel like a more normal girl for the first time in a couple of decades (the last time I did was when I was about 6), even if it will only last a couple of months. (I’m not saying overweight girls aren’t normal either, it’s just that I’ve always been slim with a stomach that suddenly bulges out like a balloon, so I feel a bit weird).  My advice is find a job that’s on your feet (assuming you’re planning for your future) or request a standing desk, so you’ll have to work on your feet, no matter how tired you get.

I go to the baking course in a vocational school, yet I’ve lost 20 pounds in 6 months. Walking! Just walk around your home if you don't want to go outside, or in your building or whatever, throw on a podcast. Walking is such good exercise. Might be hard to stick to it over time, but I found that the keto diet helped a lot because it itself had a hunger surpressant effect, and that it helped to have clear rules relating to what kind of food I could eat. If something that was unhealthy wasn't even a choice, then it was much easier to avoid it.

It took about two years, and a very stressful job after quitting the diet before I was in bad shape again (that said, it was nothing extreme, maybe 10- 13kg more than I'd like), so it didn't jump straight up again after quitting. I also liked the stability of my blood sugar during this diet.  I feel ya. I have been having trouble with binge eating/overeating (and by that I mean overeating sweets, salty snacks and junk food! No veggies here!) for a long time. I can't resist temptations, I will always find excuses, I hide my shitty eating habits and none of the sensible suggestions offered anywhere have ever worked for me. Sad to say. 

I have been able to lose weight for some periods of time, by using one strategy only, and that is defining strict and clear rules, and being accountable to someone who understands the magnitude of the problem. The rules must be simple, something like "Don't eat anything with added sugar and no salty snacks. EVER.". That means if someone offers me a teeny tiny bit of chocolate, I must decline, no matter how silly that sounds. Or else I would always find a way to bend the rules. There must be absolutely no vagueness about how I'm going to eat. 

The other thing I need is accountability, because I always break promises I make to myself. I need to speak to that person often and tell them everything, like "Today they served cake at work and I couldn't have any, it sucked". It's tremendously important that this person understands why I need to be extreme with my rules; that it's because my problem is equally extreme. A lot of people are useless for this, they will think that I have an eating disorder for not allowing myself any breaks, but it's the opposite, my secret sugar intake is the real disorder. I basically have to treat it like alcoholism. Unfortunately I fell into bad habits again after breaking up with someone who was a very good and understanding accountability partner. I had lost a lot of weight, but slowly gained it back over two years as my habits got worse and worse again.

That is the only approach that has ever worked, but this is only *my* experience. It all depends on how big of a problem you really have (most people find it hard to eat healthy, after all), what motivates you, and what hinders your progress. Some people thrive when they are allowed "cheat days", while "cheat days" would quickly turn into a "cheat life" for me. I think it's really important to pay attention to where your problems lie and why you fail, and find realistic ways to deal with each part of it. (I also can't cook because I get so distracted, so I need to have staple quick and easy meals in the house that I have chosen based on taste, calories and nutritional value.).

There is *one* other way I have recently been able to kick my habit of overeating shitty foods. That is taking Vyvanse, which I recently started for the first time. It really works wonders, because I eat out of hunger and not habit, I get full faster and stay that way for longer, and I don't feel the robotic urge to buy all sorts of crap at the store. It's like it has blocked my addiction. But before, only the above-mentioned method worked. Try weightlifting! I adore it and it’s the only thing that’ll make me exercise. 

As for food, meal prep. I just spend an entire day making food to freeze and eat that on days I don’t wanna cook. But I really enjoy cooking- it lets me wind down at the end of the day. Could you set aside an hour a night and try new foods to cook? Getting to enjoy it is probably the best solution here. I schedule a whole hour so I can chill and take my time 

Edit; the comment here that says you need an expensive gym membership and trainer- you don’t. Hit up r/fitness or r/xxfitness if you’re a woman and go to their wikis for lifting routines for beginners. If you have no interest then honestly I wouldn’t waste the money. You can’t force yourself to love something. Gym memberships don’t have to be expensive either, and the anxiety goes after a few trips  Tips on getting started.

1. Loose all sugar drinks. Drink only water or sparkling water with no extra calories.

2. Stop trying so damn hard it wont work. You should be doing slow changes, give your self rules like never eat after dinner or no seconds. Start slow and build a reliable and doable goal. 

3. Finding exercise you like is like shopping for a new style. Some like the popular things while others cant stand them and go power-lifting. Try going to a gym that offers classes and make a rule of going too these classes at-least 3 times a week. Shop a while and do not be afraid of switching them if they are not for your liking. 

4. Write what you eat down before you eat it. Changing habits is hard but one way of changing them is being aware when you fall into them. Writing things down in a diary keeps you on your toes when you can see really how much you are eating day to day. [Myfitnesspal is an ap you can get too your phone that can tell you how many calories every snack item you eat has. It helps in the way it puts a number on a food that you would not otherwise think twice about.](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)

5. Forgive your self if you fail or make mistakes, like eating a bag of chips or not following the plan, it is just as important that you dust your self off and try again. 


Making a goal and reaching it is hard for a person with ADHD I know that but you can do it if the will is there and the planning is too. Do your best and excuse the rest.  When I get hungry because I forgot to eat, I always feel weak at first and I recognize it immediately. The trick I use is to keep at least 1 portion of fruit in my lunchbox in extra than what I eat already, so that I can fightthe weakness with a quick sugar boost until I can eat properly. 

Also I keep an Ensure or a 500ml of chocolate milk in my lunchbox so I can get something in me quickly just in case. 


The best tip I have for you is to make yourself healthy lunches at home, you won't be able to grab a chocolate bar if you already ahve a fruit with you! (also no juices, it's easy calories and sugars to cout from your diet, plus fresh fruits taste much better) 


Everynight before going to bed, make your lunch for the next day. That way in the morning all you have to do is add an ice-pack and you're good to go. It's also a good routine for me before I brush my teeth and go to bed.  I've struggled with my weight all my life, and I think I have some of the same problems you do. I have a hard time with impulse control and strong cravings for simple carbs. And I've struggled for a long time to find physical activity I like.

I recently lost about 9 lbs (the first time in my life I've ever lost any measurable amount of weight). I think a bunch of things have helped.

1. I got a FitBit. It really helps me remember to at least get my steps every day. It also has a mode where it buzzes to remind me to get up and walk every hour. This has the added benefit of keeping me aware of the time I'm spending on activities (as long as I don't ignore it).

2. I've been tracking my calories with MyFitnessPal. I've tried for two or three years to do this with very inconsistent results. What finally got me to do it, I think, are the next two things.

3. I started medication. It's really helpful that ADHD pills are also diet pills! Besides the stimulant and appetite suppression effects, they've also helped me a lot with impulse control, and conscientiousness (which helps me remember to track my calories). And I've been craving sugar and carbs a lot less since I've started.

4. I've tried to shift away from thinking about the goal and more towards building habits. Weight loss is a long process, and from lots of past experience I know I'll usually do something very enthusiastically for about 2-3 weeks, then lose interest. Instead I'm trying to track my calories and exercise every day. I'm not even focusing that much on staying in my calorie goal. If I form the habit, the results will take care of themselves.

5. I moved from an apartment into a house, which means yard work! I actually really like yard work. It's the kind of work I can get absorbed by, and it's great exercise. Also, we got a dog, so I can play with him outside for exercise as well.

6. I started running on a treadmill (and here's the important part) while watching shows on my Kindle. Pairing watching certain shows with running on the treadmill has really helped. By pairing, I mean I only watch these shows when I run, and I watch them every time I run. Lately, I've been working my way through the backlog of some YouTube channels I like. The pairing means I actually look forward to going to the gym so I can keep watching. Exercise is probably an ADHD sufferer’s best friend.

It will balance out your energy levels. You’ll feel too tired to be hyper, while the endorphins work wonders on helping you you focus and concentrate. 

I’ve been lifting for 4 and a half years and honestly, I do it primarily to regulate my wellbeing. 

Once you start seriously enjoying it, you’ll find that you’re starting to force yourself to do things, such as eat towards your macros and calories. For me, this provides a structure to what once was a chaos. 

A lot of athletes have been diagnosed with ADHD. That hyperactive energy you have? Exercise actually provides a use for it (which was why ADHD was primitively beneficial). 

Just do it. Find a friend who has experience and knows what he’s doing. Do your own research. When you start to enjoy it, you’ll realise that you’ll start diverting a lot of your focus and attention to it (hyperfocus).

So good luck and try to start as soon as you can!  Only thing I found that worked is going keto. It's tough though because when I crash from the adderall occasionally I crave sugar like crazy so that can be tough.  The extreme hunger and shakiness sounds just like me. I forget to eat whether I'm on adderall or not. It's like before I know it, it's suddenly 2 PM, I haven't eaten yet, and I forgot to go grocery shopping.. again.. Even though I've been meaning to for 5+ days. I then end up going to the Starbucks across the street and eating one of their sandwiches which is just straight up simple carbs and salt. I know what to do to be healthy and keep my belly down but I just don't do it.

Knowing what's bad for you but still not being able to do it is probably the worst feeling ever. My fat tends to accumulate on my belly because I just eat all simple carbs and salt and it stresses me out because I know what I'm doing wrong.

One thing I learned is that nutritious bars like Kind Bars are your best friend. I keep at least 5 in my purse for when I go out to run errands, 5 in my backpack for school, 5 in my car because traffic here is terrible. This helps for those moments when I'm like "oh shit, I haven't eaten and I'm shaking and irritated and nauseous and I feel terrible.. I'll just go to Burger King."

Avoid bars that claim to be healthy but have tons of sugar or simple carbs in them. Try to look for a bar that's high in protein, complex carbs, and is low in sugar and salt.

Also, looking into healthy instant meals is good so you can just microwave them in a minute. In Philly, we have this place called SnapKitchen where they basically have prepackaged meals that are pre cooked and just need to be microwaved. They're full of nutrition and low calorie and your body won't shut down because they're all well balanced meals. I'm sure there's things that are equivalent to that in most cities. If not, many microwavable meals you can find at Target are actually sort of healthy. Just watch out because many of them just have small portion sizes to try to fool you or just way too much sodium. 

Also, healthy snacks like Harvest Snaps and freshly cut fruit are good as well. 

Microwavable quinoa combined with some veggies and salmon, chicken or beef makes a good, quick lunch or dinner. Cooking the veggies and meat beforehand and refrigerating them is good because, just like you, I find cooking to be possibly the worst thing ever... with doing the dishes being the second worst thing. 


& Please remember that cutting out simple carbs/sugars and drinking tons of water will make an almost instant difference in your weight and how your body/face looks. You will feel more toned and lose up to 5 lbs alone from just that. 

This will probably encourage you to keep it up and even just eliminating simple carbs and added sugar alone can make a huge difference over the span of a few months. 
 I found eating really good breakfasts helped me lose excess weight. That and avoiding beer/energy drinks.  I just ate a bag of circus peanuts after having a full dinner.

I’ve found that I can better control my intake when I’m in a structured environment.  So, I restrict my calories when I’m at work and assume I’ll just screw it up in the evening.  I also don’t make large breakfasts/lunches; I bring a variety of 70-100cal items with me that I can nibble at throughout the day.  

And finally, to keep boredom from letting me eat my way through everything, I put a little dispenser can of gum front and forward at my keyboard, with my foody bits in a drawer.  I’ll go through 4-5 pieces of gum in a workday, but it helps keep me from boredom eating because my mouth is busy. I’m in the same boat. I have high blood pressure due to weight and bad eating habits and my doc won’t prescribe ADD meds because of the side effects (could actually make my blood pressure dangerously high). He tells me exercise will help my focus but can’t seem to get it together as well. [deleted] Get rid of junk food and stock up on fruits when you want that "short dopamine rush". 

Go to the gym, even if it's for 20 minutes. Push yourself to go regardless of how you feel.

Not only will it help with your weight, but it'll help you in regards to your medication and outlook on life. Throw out all the junk food you have and don't buy more, count calories, make working out a routine, and don't buy fast-food or pop. Sports plays only a minor role in losing weight - but it makes you feel better! 

Some tips:

* Easiest fix for weightloss: stop drinking soda/juice. Try to drink water only, or tea...
* Stop buying junk food - I have the same issue. If I buy it, you can bet I will eat it the same day... 
* At the same time, look for healthy snacks! I always have some fresh veggies in my fridge. Cucumbers or carrots  are easy to prepare (I only wash them), buy a low-fat cream cheese (with herbs/chilli) and you have a ready-to-go dip...
* Look for easy-to-prepare meals which are healthy. A good starting point wood be some kind of protein+salad. The protein could be chicken breast, steaks or cheese (mozzarella, feta etc). You just have to trow it in a bowl and put some dessing on it.
* Try meal-prepping! There are easy recipes you can do, then just freeze it and you always have some ready to eat meals...


I would try to find a sport which you really like - I had the same problem and found crossfit. For me it's perfect because the community keeps you engaged and motivated (I don't know how many times I started a fitness plan in a regular gym, only to quit it after a few weeks...). So really think about joining some kind of sport club...

 I've always had difficulty cooking meals at home. There is this idea that you have to eat something different for each meal throughout the week. Trying to shop to cook a variety of meals can be difficult even if you are super interested and enjoy cooking. Often there ends up being a lot of waste, too - produce that doesn't get used or leftovers. 

For the past year I have been cooking once a week. i make around 14 meals that fit in tupperware in my fridge. Chicken and broccolli for lunch and egg scramble for breakfast or dinner depending on when I want to eat it. None of it has ever gone bad in the fridge - I run it a little cold - and I haven't gotten tired of eating the same thing. I don't waste any food and I am saving an incredible amount of money compared to when I eat out. 

Got ideas from the mealprep sub. 

The routine of it make it super manageable. I know exactly what I am going to buy at the grocery store and it only takes me an hour to cook for the whole week. The food tastes great, and I feel healthier. I found that this is the only way I have been consistently able to cook and not eat out - a fast easy routine.  Stand when you're on the computer, watching tv, or other sedentary activities.

Try to cut out soda and alcohol, or switch to low calorie versions.

Stock up on healthy choice (or similar) frozen meals. They're not the ideal choice, but you'll be eating in five minutes, and not a hamburger.

Have a protein shake for breakfast, and wait a few hours before eating.

No/low carbs in the evening.

Get enough fiber, get enough fat.

Don't buy candy and chips if you can avoid it. If it's not immediately available, the ADHD will play into your hands here and that candy bar may as well be in Sri Lanka when you really want it. Are you on meds? If not, get on meds. They make everything easier.

For diet I found that excluding by category - if that contains added sweeteners or might contain added sweeteners then it's not food - works better than anything involving tracking something (like calories or even cheat days)

For exercise, if you have a time of day you know you won't be doing anything you'll want to keep doing you can develop a daily routine and the habit will work pretty well.

 I never had a time of day like that so I just made another rule. I looked up a workout that didn't require equipment and the rule was to do 5 of each exercise daily. For my weight at the time it was a very easy amount and I frequently felt like I had barely started by the time I was done. Do that for a month and then you can increase the number. The goal here is to be doing a bit every day.  Are you diabetic? Your shaking sounds suspicious to me. Consider a high fat very low carb diet or a keto WOE( way of eating) most diets work against the body and are not goo for adhd. Eating a high fat moderate protein and very low carb diet along with fasting is great for ADHD & ADD. Not a cure all but when I am fasting I am definitely at my best. Research and consider reading “The Obesity Code” by Dr. Jason Fung.  Nutrisystem has been a life changer for me. Cooking is way too frustrating (especially because I always have to wash a dish first -- is it possible to have a clean kitchen?). It seems expensive but I feel like I was spending that much anyway on junk food and fast food all the time. Now every time I pass a Taco bell that I would have somehow spent $20 at, I remember that I have a snack in my backpack (or next to me if I thought that far ahead). I find myself getting full easily on this, much more the the entire bags of hostess donuts and twizzlers I would have eaten instead. I also have way more variety in my diet than ever before, so now eating food is both fun and healthy instead of either way too much work or unhealthy.

* The foods are all either microwavable or ready-to-eat.
* It has clearly labeled foods for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. 
* All the foods have some protein, and those with lots of protein are clearly labeled "High protein".
* You get to eat icecream, caramel fudge bars, chips, popcorn, muffins, pizza, etc.
* The food is delivered to you automatically in monthly intervals

I suggest choosing the custom plan and prioritizing food you can take/eat on the go. I try to keep a lot of "bars".

If you don't want to try a whole month you can get a weeks supply at Walmart (probably -- mine had it anyway) I also forget to eat sometimes, it's so frustrating. I can't recommend meal-prep enough; you just have to remind yourself to do it so you can develop a habit I guess.

For on-the-go snacks, one of my favourites is medjool dates! They're so sweet and so good for you (and go really well with peanut butter or walnuts, for example), I always carry some with me when I go out.

As for exercise, one of the things that has helped me so much is joining a team sport/exercise group. A friend with whom I played soccer in high school coerced me into joining a new women's team with her at the beginning of this year (I have social anxiety and bdd so that was.. hard but well worth it!). It's so damn easy to exercise when you have a whole team of other people who share a common goal doing it with you; I always forget I'm exercising when I'm at training because it's so fun and social! I've never been to a gym in my life and I'd like to keep it that way, but combining cardio from team sport and something for strength like yoga or pilates that I can do at home works better for me!
It's going to be hard to start, but you'll find a way! Good luck OP :) Hey there! Fellow ADHDer who lost 40 pounds over the course of about 7ish years. 

My advice would be to make a lifestyle that works for you. Once I finally did that, the weight began to fall off. 

I don't know about you, but I honestly have two modes when it comes to self control  - absolutely none or entirely too much. When I was trying to lose weight (and currently maintaining!) I told myself that I would be working out every damn day, and gave myself a weekly goal to hit to work out. I hate working out personally, so I try to associate working out with fun stuff - I walk 40 miles a week and do it in my basement while I'm watching television. It might not be as *high intensity* as other people, but it gets me moving and lets me indulge my love of watching movies without feeling like I've wasted time. I also watch short ab, arm, and leg toning videos and follow along - Blogilates is great!

 In regard to nutrition, I've cut things out in waves - first meat, then soda, then most refined sugars.(I don't drink alcohol, so that isn't an issue for me, but that's caloric if you do drink so maybe think about cutting that out too if you can?)  I try to make it a game for myself - can I keep my sugar intake under 25 grams? can I walk 6 miles today? - etc. And I also have figured out that I need to make food that is quick, delicious, and nutritious. So I do stuff like make easy chili or pasta dishes that I pack full of protein and veggies, but also add indulgent stuff like cheese and cream so I don't get hungry five seconds later. I'd advise keeping healthy stuff around you like almonds. And don't be afraid of the occasional setback! I've eaten cookies and candy for the past three days and I'm not really beating myself up about it. Life happens.

Best of luck!  Start cooking yourself.  >  But I can't do any of these things. 

Your problem starts right there. Stop saying "I can't" and start saying "I will". If you act as though you can't do something, you've already lost. Start taking meds. They're almost all appetite suppressants. How are you overweight? Adhd medication makes you eat less. I owe my perfect weight to it I second keeping unhealthy food out of your home. No matter how hard I try to convince myself that this time will be different, I always eat the entire containers of ice cream and chips and cookies in one or two days. I can't cook multiple meals at once either. I just sort of forget that I meant to stop eating. Then I'm too full to go to bed, so it screws up my sleep schedule, which means I don't exercise the next day. Vicious cycle, easily broken by changing shopping habits.

If I carry only a small amount of cash into the store to pay, it forces me to stick to the things on my list, or make a conscious choice of junk over real food. Also, I completely avoid certain aisles of the store; otherwise, I make that wrong choice. I'm gonna add one more thing that I think is ADHD related. I'm not one of these forget-to-eat people because food has always been such a massive dopamine reward for me (I'm always seeking out novel foods to learn to cook as well for new tastes and experiences). So I decided to never restrict my food. It just makes me miserable. Instead, I force myself to eat all my healthy food first. After that, I generally have less desire for the high reward junk food, and either eat less of it or don't eat it at all. Usually less of it.   This could’ve been written by me! Couldn’t say it better. Little goals, don’t stand in your own way, don’t be hard on yourself. DO IT! That’s awesome. What was the hardest part about switching to vegan? And did you temper down by going vegetarian first? I was vegetarian for two years, definitely enjoyed the difference. Changing to a plant-based diet has helped me in sooo many different ways (including reducing my most disruptive ADHD symptoms and reversing other irritating health problems I had), it's such a good idea!
I hyperfocused on vegan activism and all the documentaries after being vegetarian for 5-6 years and went vegan over a week; never looked back.

A whole-foods plant-based diet (WFPB) is THE BEST for long-term, sustainable weight loss because you just end up craving healthy food! All I want to eat is rice, veggies, fruit, etc. and junk food really grosses me out now so I only eat it socially. It's also improved my energy and mental health so much that I went from pretty much sedentary to playing soccer (joined a team) and exercising almost every day because I actually enjoy it. Couldn't recommend it enough! I agree with this. I lost 20 pounds by going vegan. Check out veganuary.com for information and meal plans. Watch "What the Health" on Netflix. It has had criticism but Mic the Vegan on YouTube rebuts the criticisms perfectly. Avoid being a junk food vegan such as by eating chips and drinking soda and overly processed vegan foods. Focus on Whole Foods. Carry healthy snacks with you such as nuts and whole fruit. Check out /r/vegan. Watch Earthlings. Check out Nutritionfacts.org for information on weight and diet. Fun fact: vegans are the only eating group that on average have a healthy BMI. Even vegetarians on average are overweight.  Yes totally. I like the Lean Cuisine Market ones in the black box. The ravioli with spinach is so yummy.  Eggs are life. I wish I liked hard boiled eggs tho. I eat scrambled eggs like they are going out of style. Just so damn easy and filling  I love eggs too! I eat boiled eggs as a snack, and for 70ish calories they’re awesome for that That sounds like it could work... Especially connected with Habitica.. Thanks! :D I used to watch tv sitting on an exercise ball and that strengthened my core muscles and improved my posture. Also helpful because it's much harder to balance a dish in your lap, cutting down on mindless snacking. And before I had Netflix, I'd walk the stairs during the commercial breaks. That was the extent of my exercise regime and I lost like 10 pounds. Er, foody bits include things like mandarin oranges, little Babybel cheeses in wax, Graze box snack packets, maybe a Greek yogurt in the morning.  Mostly small savory things that are heavy on fat/protein.

This way if I need a medicinal cheezburger after work, I don’t ruin everything.  My willpower is trash at night, so I just plan for it. Have you talked to him about non stimulants adhd Med?


Exercise helps, but only to a certain degree. Terrible terrible advice. Eating regularly is a huge part of ensuring that your adderall is effective.

Checkout [r/Keto](http://reddit.com/r/keto) , it changed how I approach eating, and seriously helped with my symptoms as well.
 Nope this is awful advice. And can really fuck your metabolism. Not permanently, but it can take a while to get back to normal. It also exacerbates ADHD symptoms and has a terrible effect on medication efficacy and energy levels. 

Bad bad idea That’s what I’m currently doing. Not really as a diet choice, btw. 

It’s more of a convenience, college, adhd, medication thing...

But I’m worried about my health, tbh.

Stimulants (methylphenidate in my case) already have an influence on things like heart health. And I’m also overweight. And consume a lot of coffee... :/

I need to fix this.... 

(At least I don’t smoke. And I don’t consume a lot / hardly any alcohol.) I've bascially almost entirely cut refined sugar out of my diet, and downsized my portions - to the extent that I can't actually eat a whole loaf of bread before it goes mouldy, so I have to freeze half of each loaf!

However, I will *still* occasionally forget and buy a pack of cookies or a big bag of crisps or whatever and eat the whole thing - and then regret it because I actually don't like eating that much, or that much sugar any more! Dealing with other people, I've never once craved meat (it's pretty disgusting when you really think about it tbh). Only thing I miss are boiled eggs. There's replacements for pretty much everything else. 

and nope, straight to vegan overnight.  You can pry the vegan junk food from my cold dead hands.

Plus it's a good way to get your fat and salt intake up(: I used to have a special kind of chair that helped with posture. You had to sit on your knees and it had no back, only problem was it was too short for my desk so I stopped using it. Thinking about switching docs, because he didn’t even suggest non stimulant options. For over 6 monhs, I had totally cut out sweeteners, outside of fruit, because of stomach issues, and was looking and feeling super. Then I had a big disappointment at work and bought a carton of ice cream...cut to 2 months later and I've eaten at least half a carton of ice cream every single day. But I'm stopping today because I'm getting fat again. My gf has been vegetarian for about 6 months now I think and I fully supported her choice and most evenings I make vegetarian meals but my god I crave meat so badly. Sometimes I will go a week without eating any as I really can't be bothered to cook two different meals every day and then turn into an animal when I finally have some again. I love the idea of it but there's just something deep inside me that makes me *need* it. I do like quite a lot of the veggie stuff but I think it's my brain telling me it isn't meat that makes me feel unsatisfied afterwards. Meat is absolutely disgusting. I read Skinny Bitch and the next day stayed away from it for 2 full years. Everything in moderation. I've been stressed out lately because of my bipolar disorder misdiagnosis and recent ADHD diagnosis so I totally bought some Earth Balance "Cheddar" Squares and a vegan chocolate muffin. Mmmmm so good. But these are treats, not staples. The trouble comes when they become staples.  They’re called kneeling chairs. Good for your core, terrible for your knees.

Saddle stools have a similar effect on posture and core muscles, but don’t mess with your knees and can be adjusted to different heights - I have one and I love it! (Try and find halo top ice cream. Good and low calorie) When I get those cravings I just eat meat substitutes. You're probably just craving fat and salt. Things like burgers, sausages etc are pretty close to the real thing so there's nothing to crave. Everytime I eat meat, I feel so disgusted. I was picky about eating it growing up too because the fat in my mouth just makes me sick. I also have to have it overcooked to tolerate it. I might as well cut it all together rly.  Seems like you need a reminder ;) Watch Earthlings or the new 'The Game Changers' doc when it's released in a few months Thank you, the only other problem with the kneeling chair I had was it was not built for 6 foot 3 makes. I eat meat alternatives almost every day. Like I said I quite enjoy a lot of the veggie stuff but even a really tasty burger won't satisfy me like a meat one can. What can I say I just like how dead animal tastes!
