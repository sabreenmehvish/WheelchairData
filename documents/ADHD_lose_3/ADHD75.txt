What are some organizational strategies that have worked well with you guys? So I've tried a couple different ways of getting myself organized and on top of things, but I always either forget to keep up with it or lose track of what I'm supposed to be writing down. How have you guys avoided getting behind on organizing your life? Oh quite a number of organizational tactics run my life:

- I have an Apple Watch, so I set alarms (ex: take medication, write in journal) so I don’t forget to do those things

- I set my schedule on my watch to warn me when to leave for class, and what I need to do next

- As soon as I make ANY sort of appointment, I put it in my phone calendar and planner so I don’t forget it

- I misplace my phone a lot, watch helps me with this since it can ping it

- Key ring has a wallet attached, so my keys and wallet are always together

- Keys are ALWAYS returned to the hook next to my door when I walk in

- Notebooks and other class materials all return to my backpack when I’m done using them

- All loose papers I receive go into the same binder, which I organize at the end of each week (so it doesn’t get too crazy)

- I’ve begun using my iPad for class notes, which has made organizing a bit easier (using Notability app)

- All devices go on a charger before I go to bed; iPad is strategically charged next to my backpack on the floor, so I won’t forget it when I leave for class

- bullet journaling! Im not super good at keeping up with it, but I write down everything I need to do in my bullet journal planner, and even do some habit tracking in it; it keeps me motivated to keep with my tasks I set out to do and the habits I want to stick to

- Saturday is cleaning day, I really force myself to clean my room so everything doesn’t spiral into a disaster; I clean my bathroom, vacuum, wash sheets, etc.  it helps me to have a specific day to do this! Keys in a bowl by the door.  Every time.  

Also, get a Tile® Mate for your keyring, or a reasonable facsimile.

Every time you leave a room take something with you that doesn't need to be in that room.  Phone reminders for everything, calendar is a must efrom appts to new upcoming seasonal shows i watch! alarms for everything.  Even to remind kids to brush teeth.  

Key on a hook and goes on my purse everytime i walk in the door. I need an iwatch!   But then i have a text free number to cal my pho e from my tablet, so that works too.   Also, hyperfocusing on these reminders is #1 key. Never forget about reminders.  I constantly look at my wall calendar, (my days are boring) but i input it on both, paper and phone for reminders.  Took me a long time to figure out how NOT to forget.   The watch is honestly amazing.  I was really hesitant about buying it because I was worried it was going to be just another purchase I would never use but that’s not the case!
