What are some Tips & Tricks you guys have learnt for when you forget your medication? I sometimes forget to take my dexies on the worst days, so do you guys have some good focusing techniques for during classes? I'll often find it hard to switch modes, I'll zone out and hyperfocus. I'd be happy to hear if you have a mantra, technique, or some tips that help you in these sort of emergencies? Record everything. Leave your phone on record all day
