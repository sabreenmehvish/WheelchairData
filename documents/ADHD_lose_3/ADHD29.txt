How do I become more concise? I take 20-45 minutes to share stories when I've been told by some friends that it could've been told in 5-10 minutes or 5 sentences. I've been sharing two separate wild/eff'd up stories from my recent vacation hopping across Europe and I've found it extremely difficult to be concise regardless of which language I used (I'm bilingual). I just NEED to give context (read: frivolous, but *helpful* details that I *cannot* omit) for the whole story to make sense. It physically and mentally hurts to not give details to anyone, and I get anxiety when I'm being rushed by someone impatient (only one out of 5 were impatient and kept whining for me to get to the point).

TL;DR: My stories are always long-winded. How do I make them short without omitting necessary details and annoying to other person? Practicing/ rehearsing. I speak three languages fluently, this is the only thing that has worked for me.

The only way I can tell a story without violating all of [Grice's maxims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle#Grice's_maxims) is by going over the story you'll tell several times until you can reliably re-tell it roughly the same way. I started actually writing shit like that out before asking questions of colleagues (I used to give too much or too little information, annoying everyone in the process), and with time, I've become a lot better at recognising whether something is crucial someone else's understanding of the thing I'm talking about or merely an interesting embellishment. I really hope somebody gives you a good answer because my adhd friend does this every damn time he talks about something. He’ll also add in dramatic pauses (between EVERY SENTENCE) and give details and backstory that really don’t matter. 

While I don’t have this comorbidity (whatever it is), I will tell you the way I tell stories. There’s the main plot, the important details and the secondarily important details. I tell the main plot while putting in the important details as they come up and leave out the secondary details. While the secondary details add to the story, they’re not necessary. You will ultimately talk to the person you’re talking to after about it and THAT is where you tell the secondary parts, not in the main story. That way you have an engaging, concise story with discussion and added details after that make the whole thing more engaging. I’m not sure if it will be difficult for you to put this into practice, but I hope this helps. 

Might I also ask, do you take longer to do things in general? Like if you had a cup of tea or coffee, do you find it going cold often? Or you might take a bite of your food once every 10 minutes? These are also things that my friend does and just wondering if it’s linked to the slow story telling. I'll let you know when I figure it out :') For real though, I have the same problem (and I'm also bilingual). It gets to the point where I can see the impatience in people's faces when I can't get to the point faster and then I get anxiety about that and then COMPLETELY forget what I was saying and then I simply just give up. Honestly, by the time I actually get to the end of the story, I completely forget what the initial point of why I was telling the story in the first place was. People find it so annoying but like I can't help it! Not only that, I constantly lose train of thought during the story. I'll legit drift off and have to ask someone what I was talking about again...It's like my brain is trying to think ahead of what I'm saying and figure out what I'm going to say next but then I'll lose the thought of what I'm actually saying. Really awkward when you just meet the person and they think you have some severe dementia going on or something :') [deleted] **Cooperative principle**

In social science generally and linguistics specifically, the cooperative principle describes how effective communication in conversation is achieved in common social situations, that is, how listeners and speakers must act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way. As phrased by Paul Grice, who introduced it, "Make your contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged." Though phrased as a prescriptive command, the principle is intended as a description of how people normally behave in conversation. Jeffries and McIntyre describe Grice's maxims as "encapsulating the assumptions that we prototypically hold when we engage in conversation".

The cooperative principle can be divided into four maxims, called the Gricean maxims, describing specific rational principles observed by people who obey the cooperative principle; these principles enable effective communication.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 Thanks so much for the info on Grice's Maxims, never heard of them.

About practice—the thing is, I told my story in its raw version to the first two friends tolerant of my long-windedness so I could use them as practice for the other friend, but that didn't work because with her, it was in English so it was linguistically different. She told me I could've told my story in 10 minutes. So I used that as the English-version practice for the other two people and... Fail. The final person was so impatient that I realized I had a problem and came here lol. I'll definitely still work on practicing, but also apply the Maxims and the ice cream sandwich technique from another comment. Not OP, but the storytelling thing and the general distractibility can both be linked to a bunch of different things. For me, storytelling chaos occurs because I get caught up in all the details and neglect to outline the big picture (or because I combine the outline and the details in a way that make it hard to follow for others). That's due to trouble prioritising and organising information.
 Taking forever to do menial tasks like eating or drinking is because I get distracted, which is kind of similar but on a much smaller scale -- they both are related to problems sticking to what should be the main priority at that moment because other things keep jumping the mental queue. All of that describes my storytelling experiences. Glad to hear from another person, so thank you. I hope you get better with telling stories, but also stay surrounded by people who won't find you annoying if your brain inevitably does decide to tell the entire story anyway. I really like that tip, thinking of stories as an ice cream sandwich and gauging the listeners' reactions to adjust your story accordingly. I'll definitely use that. Thanks.
