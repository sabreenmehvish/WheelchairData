So I kinda have a big problem that I dont know how to fix. So I have had ADHD for a long while. I am not a very organized person as many people on this sub can relate, but I did not know until visiting this sub that a symptom of adhd is forgetfullness. Being forgetful is what I feel to be holding me back in life. How do you guys cope with it? I tried an agenda but everytime something came up I forgot to write it down. Idk what I should do. I have this problem too. For the past two weeks, I've been carrying around a pocket-sized notebook and pen with me everywhere I go. As soon as something I think I need to remember pops into my head, I pull it out and jot it down. It has made a huge difference. My working memory may be completely garbage, but I can always rely on my written memory. 

It took me a few days of trial and error with remembering to use it but after two weeks it's almost become second nature. 

You can get a 5 pack for 10 bucks on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WKZ3Y88/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_GW77BbEJ65WBY Small notebooks, or the notes app on your phone. I also set a phone alarm for anything time sensitive I have to remember, like taking medication or small tasks.  How about a nutritional approach? Works for me. I can’t commit to writing anything down for more than a week, so I just boost my base stats. Also, if you’re really into writing stuff down, maybe a portable white board? Yup. Post-it’s or a notebook, I just recently started using a “wipe book” (spiral notebook with whiteboard pages). I have to keep my to-do list with me and available... 
**tl;dr:** **create a system that works for _you_. But don’t get caught up in making it perfect.** **And some tips**

How to deal with this differs from person to person because you have to essentially create a system that works _for you_. It’s a trial and error kind of thing that will take a while (a bit like finding the right meds and dose). **So don’t give up if it takes a few tries!**


I recently listened to a podcast called ‘the ADHD podcast’ (episode 365 ‘starting small is nothing to fear’) and they talk about the getting things done system and how you need to tweak it so it works for you.  That’s so important because I used to write things down in notebooks but then never opened them again. Now I use todoist and due on both my iphone and apple watch. I have my reminders and tasks all in plain sight.

**Some tips**:
- create a (daily) routine for checking your tasks and other reminders. (Don’t see this as another thing you _have_ to do. Just find a moment that is best for you and don’t worry if you forget it sometimes)
- prepare for tomorrow. So quickly look at what you have to do. This gives you some focus and peace of mind. Don’t stress over what you need to do, you’ve got all day tomorrow to do it!
- tweak your system. Don’t change the entire thing if one part of it doesn’t work! 
- don’t get stuck in creating the perfect system. It’s not supposed to be perfect, it’s supposed to work. You’ll forget what the system is actually for: not forgetting stuff.
- find ways to makenit a bit less demanding on your brain and mood. There are things that aren’t rewarding at all. So create rewards for yourself. Mine is telling my SO what I did way to enthousiastically. Even if it is just posting a card that I should have posted a week ago

 So don’t worry: your problem is actually very fixable. 

Good luck!

*edit*: Markup. Never thought of it that way. Also, try to always keep your pen clipped on to the notebook. That was a hard one for me to get the hang of.  Yup. Can confirm. My meds make me less scatterbrained, but my real saving grace has been my notebook.
