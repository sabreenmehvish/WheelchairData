How do you make yourself do...? Thing? That are hard to do. 

I know this is the crux of our brain issue. Turning knowing into doing. 

I know how to eat well and exercise to lose weight, but lately, the past year or so I CANNOT make myself stick to a reasonable diet. 

I gained 25lbs last year and can’t force myself to do anything about it. I can’t even stop thinking about it when I’m shoving junk in my mouth, screaming at myself to just freaking stop. 

Is there any hope? Can I ever figure out how to control myself? 

I’m happy to see this turn into a general discussion about accomplishing really hard tasks of all varieties (that don’t have to do with cell phone alarms, pomodoros, and planners).  for me, I often forget what I'm doing. so I'll pick up a thing related to what I'm doing and hold onto it, TIGHT, so I don't absentmindedly set it down. helps.  First- subscribe to r/SwoleAcceptance 
Second- give yourself a bedtime, use alarms, and whatever else you need to do and go to bed at a reasonable hour
Third-wake up at a good time if/when possible, try to maintain this 
Forth-eat breakfast *before* going to the gym. Your body does work when you are sleeping and you need to refuel it and prep yourself for the lift to come
Fifth- don't be afraid to ask for suggestions, exercises, diet tips from the trainers. You don't need to pay them (unless you want to) but they'll give you pocket tips if you need them. 

Lastly, and this is the most important IMO. Take your medication and see a therapist regularly. Even if you don't think you need one, or don't see the point, do it. Having a professional and objective opinion look at your life, problems, goals, and so on is one of the best things you can do.  First of all, medication helps me a lot with everything, but I spent a lot of time without it and some things already improved (a bit and slowly) before I was diagnosed.

For me it really helps to solve each thing I struggle with on it's own, so not 'how can I be less forgetful' but, how to make forgetting/misplacing my keys less of a nuisance (give the neighbor a set, have 3 sets so I can always find one, start only closing the door when I'm holding the keys). 

For losing weight, it's things like no junkfood in the house, so when I'm hungry, going for ice-cream/cookies would mean a trip to the shop so eating an apple/banana is easiest option. Even if I screw up outside of the home, at least part of it is going better. 

To get myself to move more, it's things like starting with just going places I want to be and need to walk at (visit a huge museum, walking around in the local zoo). Or do things I like, like yoga and then make that as easy as possible (sleep in an outfit I can do yoga in, make sure the mat in place the night before, then do it first thing in the morning, so I can't forget about it). 

 The only way I can make long term changes is to break down the end goal into tiny steps and create habits.


Ie With healthy eating, I would have to start by making a concious effort to 'have fruit for morning snack at 10am instead of biscuits' for a week or so and stick to it before moving on to the next bit, 'go for 20 minute walk at 7pm' or whatever.


If I try too much at once I either immedietely fail or get really into it for a week and then fail.  The only way I can make long term changes is to break down the end goal into tiny steps and create habits.

I personally do have a pretty set schedule for sleeping/work. I’m asleep around 11:30 every night and up between 7:30 and 8. Even on days when I could sleep in :-( 

I know how to eat better and lose weight- I’ve done it before. I just can’t make myself cut out the junk food that’s causing so much destruction right now. And then I get caught in a loop of hating myself for not being able to change anything. 

I was working out and lifting regularly for like over a year until last year around this time when my IT band acted up and made it nearly impossible for me to even touch my toes for like 6 weeks. And I haven’t been able to get back on the bandwagon since. 

I feel honestly trapped by my brain. It sounds so stupid and awful but I feel like if anyone would understand, it’s people on this sub.  I don’t know if this is the issue with you for junk food, but don’t buy stuff that isn’t healthy at the grocery store. It’s harder if you go out to eat a lot, but if you cook at home, it’s easier to plan.

If there’s no cheezits/pringles/cookies at home, then you can’t eat it. That’s always my issue. I buy snacks and will “just eat a few” and am constantly snacking all day.

Besides that, medication cutting my cravings is the only thing that’s helped.  I eat the junk food at work :-( 

I keep praying meds will help with my cravings and appetite. Adderall sorta did but that made me feel like shit so we switched to concerta and I haven’t felt anything like that so far.  Ugh that’s the worst. I had the same issue, since you can’t really control what’s in the break room :/ 

It’s different for everyone, but I know concerta helps a good friend of mine curb her cravings a bit. Hopefully once you get on the right dose that will help you.
