"The Power of Habit" A good read. I'm reading "The Power of Habit: Why we do What We do In Life and Business." Im not very far into it, only finishing the first chapter, but it is very interesting. I feel like a lot of us would benefit from this book.

Has anyone read the whole thing? Have you implemented anything from this book into your life? How has it been useful?

Even if you havent, how do you implement habits/change poor habits? I have to make habits in my life or I skip things. I put the contents of my pockets in the same place every night, my ring goes in the same place before I go to sleep. When I do my night routine, I take my toothbrush, flosser and toothpaste and put them in their place every time, so that I don't forget a part of the routine.

 I try to automate everything I can as sort of a fail safe too. Google Calendar is pretty much the foundation of my life. I have to put everything on there or I'll most likely forget about something I was supposed to do.
