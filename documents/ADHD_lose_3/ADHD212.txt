Just like if you lose your glasses it's really hard to find them without glasses... ...it's really hard to remember to take ADHD meds without having taken ADHD meds. Yeah, I'm right there with you on this.  
I even have reminders set up on my phone that end up serving only as an annoyance when they disturb me in the midst of  my ~~needless multi-hour procrastination binges~~ important research. Omg right?! This is why I cannot survive without Med strips.  My super power is ignoring visual and auditory stimuli! What are med strips? I feel there's a niche for our sort in refereeing in  major sports events. At least judging from how ref's are usually portrayed. I mean, being oblivious and getting paid for it? I think it's time to dream big.  They are the pill organizers that have a compartment for each day and are usually labeled with the day and AM/PM. I just call them med(icine) strips. Lol Oh! I have one of those! I just need to remember to use it....ðŸ¤£ Mine stays in my purse ALWAYS. I take my meds in front of my purse and put it back in lol I should get back into that habit.
