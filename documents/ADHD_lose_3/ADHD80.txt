Just called in sick AGAIN for work instead of just being late. Throwaway because I feel like I've embarrassed myself enough on my main.

I feel like my career is on the edge of crumbling.  I managed to get a really good job through family ties but it's not gonna last if I keep doing this.   I usually wake up to my first couple alarms but then lose track of which alarms I actually need to get out of bed to and end up sleeping in to the point of almost just being late.

Today if I left when I was "ready", I could have been able to get there and get all set up just in time for 7:30.  But then I realized I didn't have my ID badge to get in the gate.  I looked all over and then just gave up on work today.  Ironically I found it under my desk while I made the call in.

I want to be honest but last time (and the only time) I've ever straight up just said "Hey I'm so sorry, I slept in", my head supervisor really didn't like that and I just got teased all day for being on "banker's hours" by everyone else.  I know it's just teasing but I'm already ripping myself to shreds.

&#x200B;

I know what it is too.  I just can't turn off my brain at night.  I've got the racing thoughts that most have come to painfully understand and I just can't cope with them.  No matter how hard I try, the later it gets the more I feel a strong pull to just keep on doing SOMETHING.  As stupid as it sounds, I tend to be on and off melatonin because I don't want to take it every night and it feels like I'm abusing it even though I keep my dose regular.

&#x200B;

I don't know, just needed to vent.  It sucks when it feels like I'm gonna mess up a career path that plays to my strengths and pays the bills that I remember exist sometimes.

TL;DR: Woke up for work late and forgot my badge, called in sick. What worked for me was getting an old-timey alarm with bells that I placed across the room. This was during the (luckily brief) phase where I had to be in the office at 8:30 which meant I had to wake up at 6

Fixed place for badge, keys and any other necessity is also useful. I have a dedicated lidless box for all things I need. (I still occassionally forget my work card but I can get a day-pass).

I use the 1-2-3-4 (tap all pockets and verify the thing that needs to be in there is there, 1-phone, 2-bike keys, 3-house keys, 4-wallet before I go out. This is a fixed ritual which I always do, every single time before I open the front door. At least I don't lock myself out of the house that way (happened a few too many times)

Rituals and triggers that you cannot ignore are what work for me. The rituals are hard to grind in but once they are there they can save your bacon. Don't let yourself fall back into bed, once you're on your feet move to the next step in your (fixed if you can manage) morning routine.

I had the same thing with loads and loads of thoughts in the brain, I spent about 3 weeks dead tired at work and then started to actually fall asleep (from exhaustion?). Hope things settle down. If this is a new job don't forget you're dealing with a ton of nervous energy which is going to make you activated/makes it hard to switch off.

that's the best I can suggest :) I understand this is more to vent so maybe just ignore what I wrote above, but if any of these help it might save you some stress in the long run.  I appreciate the feedback :)

I've actually started thinking about what gets me off as far as organization goes and I realize that boxes and slots for things are the ticket.  Just need to figure out how I'm gonna do that without living in a home full of totes and bins.

It's funny that you mention the ritual thing.  When I first went off to college I started trying to remember things by repeating "Wallet, keys, tablet, phone, lunch, drink".  Being in the work force for a few years now and it's evolved to include new things and I find myself accidentally using it as one of my stress reduction strategies.  Feeling disorganized, stressed, forgetful, stupid?  Answer: "Wallet, keys, vape, phone, lunch, drink" as fast as I can.

Just started medication today so hopefully I can have the mental clarity to start and stick to more rituals, including possibly just dropping my pants into a bin after work.
