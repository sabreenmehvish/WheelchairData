I've started to make lists I always have things to do as a university student. But for the last 2 years,I didn't feel accomplished because I always forget everything I need to do!

But this academic year, I've started writing down EVERY random thought about things I need to do. It's really helping a lot. I keep my notebook in my bag with a pen. 

 Good for you. 

Have you considered a Bullet Journal? I've got notebooks everywhere, I've got a running list of top important things on my phone homescreen, I've got two apps with lists for work / home / to do / remember / reminders. I have a ton of work crib sheets in different places on my laptop. I write down my own recipes and meal plans so I always have ideas when I'm at a loss. I have to do lists and running lists of projects that need to get done. 

Sometimes I'll forget I made a reminder for something, which is frustrating, but overall, lists help me function. They help me free up brain space. They help me remember (even if I forget the list, the act of writing improves my recall). They help me prioritize and stay organized to the degree that's possible. They help me stay connected to my day-to-day. I'd be lost without them. Write it down!  I have done this off in on to little success. Currently trying with a yellow notebook so it grabs my attention. Seems to work a bit better. Digital notes were the worst idea...  I have not but I will look into it thank you :)
