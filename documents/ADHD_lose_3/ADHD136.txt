For those of you who are hard on yourselves: don't forget to recognize the things you have already accomplished. Big or small. If you're anything like me, you often catch yourself feeling worthless/ feeling like you are underachieving while forgetting about all of the things you've already completed or accomplished. 

I've found journaling every day about the day's events, what i'm grateful for, etc.. has helped significantly with my self esteem and feelings of self worth. I often get so hung up on what i should be doing or what i'm not doing i completely forget about everything i've already done.  You're a lot better than you give yourself credit for! this is awesome. whenever i see a post by someone having  a bad day, i want to remind them how rad it is that they are even here commenting...probably somewhere comfortable, with wifi, on a nice phone or laptop..thats alot...to me anyways Thank-you. 

I needed that.  I did this today! I was about to get down on myself for only sending my resume to only 1 job  today, but instead I was like "hey, thats 1 more than yesterday". You're right! I'm killing it!
