I literally forgot I had class today I just now realized i should have gotten the bus 20 minutes ago. I'm lying in bed, watching an hour long video about H3H3 Productions. Also, today is the deadline to hand in my final thesis. Ask me if i'm finished...

Well, it seems like ritalin isnt working. Sigh. I don't really have much advice, mostly just some condolences and hope for you to pull it through! First, if you haven't contacted your school's ADA department, then do so asap! 

Also asap, contact your professor, preferably in person (maybe even showing up and waiting outside the class when it's over if that's an option for you) and just be honest and up front about it all. They're human too, more often than not, they get it. 

And, especially if turning in things late isn't an every day/week thing, they'll likely give you at least the weekend to finish. I did something very similar and she allowed me to have the delayed due date/time be Sunday night instead of Friday night since she said she usually isn't finished grading until mid-day Monday and would be okay with just having mine be the last one. If you're close enough to being done, maybe even offer to have it in by Sunday night as an option and be prepared to go into detail about how you'll not let it happen again, possibly even listen to them lecture or give advice that may or may not help at all. 

Another thing you could look into, if this is like an end of course thing, is seeing if you can take an "incomplete" which gives you a few weeks to get everything caught up and turned in. I'm not sure honestly if all schools offer this kind of thing though. 

But best of luck buddy, I'm rooting for you and you should update me once you find something out! If you forget to update me that's okay, I definitely understand how that works and won't take it personally, and honestly I probably will forget to check back anyway if you don't end up responding 🙃 I forgot I had to work today. With luck, my workplace is 10 min of walk from home.
Yesterday I had a paper to turn in. Didn’t know until my school app sent me a notification “your paper is du in 4 hours”. 

You’re not alone struggling my friend.  The first day of the semester I spent all day repotting my plants and rearranging my apartment....because I thought it was still Sunday. My friend called me at 8pm to ask how my first day back was and it wasn't until then that I realized it was Monday. Sure enough, checked my emails and had a bunch from people I had meetings with asking where I was. 

Imagine how fun it was telling my supervisor and advisor why I had missed everything... literally all I could say was "I truly thought it was Sunday." They probably thought I was drunk. 

I guess try not to beat yourself up too much about it, you can only do as much as you can do and dwelling on falling short definitely won't help. Otherwise, I'm right there with you friend. No idea what the solution is. listen to u/[im-a-lllama](https://www.reddit.com/user/im-a-lllama) their suggestions sound like a decent plan Why did this give me anxiety wtf Hey hey hey it me responding 4 days later...

I'm almost done with my thesis! Yay! I talked to my professor about my ADD and she ended up telling me that she had to take ritalin a few times to finish some of her projects too, lol. I can hand in my project until the end of November but I want to get it done this week. She's awesome and for some reason she likes me, so I'm fine, it looks like I'm graduating this year after all. Thank you so much for your comment, I really appreciate it, this sub makes me so happy.  Hehe, some of us professors have actually looked at the clock and said “oh SHIT I should have been teaching class 20 minutes ago!” 

So yeah, I concur that there’s at least a chance they may understand, haha!

This is all great advice! Thanks for sharing! Hope you were able to get your paper done, thanks for your support!  >No idea what the solution is.

Yeah, pretty much same here. Did you get in trouble at work? Hope you're okay. 

&#x200B; I'm sorry lol Yay! I'm happy for you! Good luck on knocking it out and good job on finding the motivation to get it done sooner rather than waiting til the last second again :) My teacher is a little bit forgetful too, just like me, so I felt less alone after I talked to her. And hey, keep up the good work, being a teacher is no easy task, even less when you have ADHD.  I did get in trouble, and unfortunately I didn't have an excuse I could really explain well. But I care about what I do, which shows, so they've since forgiven me. I feel like the regularity with which I make that kind of fuck-up means that I'm always in some sort of probationary position, but I usually squeak by somehow. Thank you- doing my best till the semester is done. Then I’m giving myself an ADHD holiday, firing up red dead redemption, and not doing anything productive for a few days :)
