I often lose/forget my thoughts, but always remember distinctly how the thought made me feel? Is this a common ADHD thing? Is it because our attention/executive function is in one area of the brain and our emotions are somewhere else?

One of my biggest difficulties that medication hasn't even really helped with is having a thought (a task I need to complete, something I want to do, a random idea or memory) and then almost IMMEDIATELY losing it because of another interrupted/distracted thought. I will have absolutely no recollection of what it was I had originally been thinking about.

But...

I almost always have a distinct impression of how that thought had made me feel--whether it's anxious, excited, hopeful, wary, or even more abstract like "I remember feeling like it would make me want to go running outside on a sunny day" or "It made me feel like I needed to protect myself from someone I know, but I can't remember who or what about."

It's like trying to remember a dream--sometimes digging around the feelings/weird imagery will bring me back to the thought--"Oh! I was thinking about that project at work that I forgot about and will have to apologize for being late on and THAT'S why I felt wary and anxious."

But sometimes I never remember and then just feel kinda weird.

Can others relate? It's so strange to me that the thought can disappear so quickly, but my feelings related to that thought don't 
 disappear with it. Is there a scientific reason for this? Very much yes.  I've noticed that I tend to remember in feelings rather than words or specifics.  It makes arguing or explaining things very difficult,  especially with logic minded people who just don't understand.  Journaling is supposed to help tremendously,  but I haven't really tried.  

ADHD in general, I find, is really about managing emotional overload.  For whatever reason,  we can't always sort through all the feelings and emotions to properly articulate what we wish to convey.  It's why I have the hardest time connecting with people socially.   I have this exactly, I’ve asked others and they tell me everyone has it but they described it completely differently. 

I can’t remember anything about my childhood, my school career (pre college and actual college) or even the past year besides my feelings. I remember last February as a feeling of stressed unknowing and then sudden delight. Or my first December in college was intense loneliness I wanted to end, the feeling of finally letting go and then surprise and melancholy.  /u/reallyokfinewhatever - I added a scientific explanation for the forgetting part to the end, under "EDIT." If you are interested...!

Have you tried other meds or a higher dose? Or did you just stick with the first one that gave you a lot of improvement in other areas?

What you described used to happen to me constantly, before meds. And still does if I haven't been looking after myself (sleep/nutrition/accidentally skipping several doses). 

I also used to experience something similar *during* thinking - like the thought wasn't ever fully attended to, fully formed, or turned into internal language, but the *feeling* was there. I could tell you my general end opinion on something, but not with a rationale. I knew my opinion just because I could feel it in my body. Like a voodoo seance with hands moving around in the air and closed eyes searching for the spirit's location in the room, to palate their energy. (Sorry if anyone here practices voodoo, I'm just calling on what Hollywood tells me because that's kind of how it feels.)

I read that we are *intuitive* thinkers, and I think that fits what I just described well. I'm not sure if your OP and what I just described are related, but they both seem like we are having access to feelings but not thoughts. 

Your explanation seems like it's heading in the right track to me. 

EDIT: I took a cognitive psych course in college. It's been a while, but from the things I remember, I suspect this is part of it:

So, we hold multiple thoughts/info in working memory (WM), which is kind of like our work bench -- we keep things we want/need to use there. People with ADHD can't keep as many items there. We can all switch primary attention around within the items we are holding there. As long as the item stays in WM (there's a timeframe for how long it can stay there without being the object of attention), we can access it again. Once it is attended to for long enough, it is encoded into proper memory - (that's part of why chanting a phone number you've just heard helps you remember it - you are attending to it in WM for a long time). At that point, it no longer needs to be in WM memory to access it. We could go on with our entire day and still remember it at the end of the night, particularly if we have strengthened the memory by recalling it for even a few seconds once or twice that day. Although, if our brains aren't working well after a long stressful day, we might have difficulty.

Most people can hold something in WM while they attend to the new thought that comes in, both thoughts held in WM. But because our WM holds fewer items, our original thought will sometimes get pushed out. If we can hold 2 items, in theory we could hold onto both thoughts, but if we already had 2 items in there, then one of the old items gets dropped. Also, I *think* that our overall cognitive load (such as complex reasoning and language comprehension) impacts this as well.

Because you said you only had the original memory for a flash to begin with, it wasn't in WM long enough to be encoded into proper memory. So it's just gone. 

Sometimes you probably do get back to the original idea, but because everything goes smoothly, there's no cause to notice. And so it seems that forgetting is the norm! But we are all constantly shifting attention back and forth between things, all day. It's usually so quick and automatic that we don't actually sense that our attention left its original target. 

I keep trying to come up with good examples of returning to a thought after a distractor, but then realize that I either do often forget what I was doing/thinking (haha!) or I never really properly disengage from the original thought (like when my husband tries to tell me somethimg while I'm reading). But apparently we *never* attend to 2 things at once. Even when multitasking, say when we are driving and having a conversation with the passenger - we are merely switching attention between 2 things at lightning speed. We don't feel like we aren't paying attention to the road, but for a few microseconds we actually aren't. 

Doesn't really explain why we still experience the feeling. I think as you suggested it does have to do with the separation of executive functioning and the limbic system.

Anyway, long explanation. For anyone who is interested! I have a lot of issues with remembering my childhood... But thought it was due to just having a crappy childhood, but there a feelings and impressions.... Wow never really thought it like that till now. And there a lot of times I remember that I was pissed or stressed over something but can't remember the details and then feel like I'm crazy! 

By the way if this helps for the OP, I  severely suffer the "I need to do this" or "ooo I wanna try that!" or the list goes on, but in my head and so fast I could never really remember cause I'm distracted by the next thought, sound, feeling etc.

Now I am forcing myself to make lists.  It's a pain in the arse at first, but wow it is really helping. I have lists of fun stuff, projects, things to research, chores, shopping... I just keep adding and making new ones.    It might sound a little over the top or overwhelming but.... Seeing my thoughts sorted has really helped calm alot of my racing mind. It's out, I can go back to it and remember it.....and do it, Thanks inpart the meds helping on the motivation /procrastination problem!   Sorry got long winded.    I'm not sure if it's specifically an ADHD thing but it's very relatable. I get the goldfish brain and then I have a lingering feeling of something. It's the worst when I was going to write it down and all that's left is a vague anxiety. I know this feeling exactly! It can be really irritating to have the remnants left from a thought but not be able to find the thought itself anymore.

I’m told that the way I recall thoughts that I’m having trouble finding is weird... I hold onto whatever I can from the remnants of the thought (ex. if I know I was in my bedroom when I thought it and I know it made me excited, I hold onto that), and then I sit with that stuff in mind and close my eyes and wait for the thought to surface. Most of the time it works pretty well, and it’s saved my ass on a number of tests.

I know it sounds super strange and it might not make a lot of sense, but I figure if anyone’s going to understand it, it’d be the people on this sub. On a daily basis: “I was upset about something...🤔” I think it does happen to me, but I also can't describe the feeling itself either. xD Haha yeah, sometimes I end up feeling angry but I forgot why! All the time!! This extends towards memories as well. I can't remember a lot of my life but I remember the feelings that came with it? I love your username, BTW! I struggle with the same phenomena- it’s funny the op compared it to remembering a dream- that’s exactly what I have described when trying to explain the experience.... to myself with me narrating to myself... in my own head...... because if I’m being honest, when it happens in the middle of interacting with others, I just completely ignore that there was a weird 2 second pause where it may look like I’m having a minor stroke and I continue on as normal, like don’t even acknowledge it and I know that THEY KNOW that something ADHD-Y (or ,at the very least, weird as fuck) just happened, but we just have a nano second of awkward pause and on we go, having a conversation... one I may OR MAY VERY WELL NOT forget in 5 minutes. We’ll see. Everyday is promising of me inevitably doing something fucking weird despite my determination not to. Sometimes I can feel the weird creeping up like “oh fuck, rtllz, you’re gonna do something or say some weird shit aren’t you? Don’t you- then BAM! I do or say something weird as shit.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Yes this happens a lot to me. Especially relatable after watching or trying to recall scenes in movies. I forget what the whole thing is about but remember that I liked the film or found it really funny. The worst part of this is when I am trying to sort out something that is giving me anxiety. So I try to talk to yourself rationally, cite details,  and make connections between present feeling and past trauma, but when you try to do that and can't because you keep on forgetting, all that is left is the feeling of anxiety without a way to sort it out.  I thought this was just me!  I didn’t realize that it was so widely experienced.  

Edit: Sometimes I have “residual effects” from experiences that have happened, feelings of dread, anxiety or sadness, but I can’t remember why or what made me feel that way.  It’s hard for me to remember why I’m having these feelings.

Edit:  I definitely don’t remember what was said, I do remember how I felt.    I think this happens to everyone. Of course ADHD people forget short term things way more often so this occurring is way more frequent, but I think that neurotypical people as well when they happen to forget something they were just thinking about, the feeling of it stays but can't quite put a finger on what it was. I do this too. I can remember exactly how I felt, which can be very overwhelming, but have no idea why I did or remember way later yes! everyday. It makes it even more frustrating that I can’t remember it. Sometimes it comes in fragments but I can never get the full memory. Ugh.  "Logic minded" I'm 100% into the descriptor  > I also used to experience something similar during thinking - like the thought wasn't ever fully attended to, fully formed, or turned into internal language, but the feeling was there. I could tell you my general end opinion on something, but not with a rationale. I knew my opinion just because I could feel it in my body. 

Yes, this is it exactly! And oftentimes the effort involved in trying to break it down feels pointless because the end result is already fully formed. It makes me appear more impulsive than I am, when I actually DO go through the entire thought/logical/emotional process, just more quickly than I can articulate.

On the meds, I seem to be pretty sensitive to them and so am on 20mg vyvanse. When I went to 30mg, it completely zombified me and had no extra benefit, so I went back down. I haven't tried any others, though my psyh has said it might be helpful to try switching. I've been on my current med/dose for over 6 months and it is extremely helpful but definitely lacks in some areas. What I could manage to skim was super interesting. I've been meaning to post about my spotty long term memory, in addition to WM, but... Haven't, for obvious reasons. 

This reminded me because the emotions thing. I can experience something, have an amazing time, and barely be able to tell you anything about it an hour later. 

Best way I can explain this, I went to a concert. I flew to another state, to meet online friends for the first time in person, who took me to see this concert of one of my favorite bands of all time, because they weren't playing in my state. It was amazing. After it, I was handed the set list. Fucking amazing. I was about to cry. On the way back to my friend's place, I'm looking at the list and one of the songs is abreviated and I have no idea what it was, despite knowing the entire discography of the band and being 100% present the entire time. It took me an hour to remember, and only because I started listing off the song names in order by album. And it finally clicked.

Additionally, at one point in the concert, I made the mental note that my purse needed to be washed. My purse, in particular. It was a punk concert, I'm covered in sweat, but my purse was outside my clothes, so that's not it...

Couple months later, I search YouTube, and sure enough, someone uploaded the concert to YouTube. I'm watching it, reliving it, and I see the band pour beer or something out at the audience. I was at the front, my purse against the fence. It got sprinkled in beer. 

I knew I needed to wash it, but I couldn't remember that the band did that until I saw it again, and it all came back.

My brain picked out some of the most insignificant things, and held onto them, rather than the entire experience. I think we all experience that, but when people ask why I take so many pictures and hold onto things from the past, it's because without those physical things, I just won't remember. At all. And it sucks.

Sorry if this was super irrelevant. I just really wanted to share, and it felt sorta relevant... I 100% do the same thing!!! Woah.  Thanks! I say that because I find that those types of people - people who rely heavily on logic,  ie - if this happens,  then that should - simply don't understand the emotional component.   >Oftentimes the effort involved in trying to break it down feels pointless because the *end result is already fully formed*.... I actually DO go through the entire thought/logical/emotional process....

YES!

I'd have to tell people, I don't know exactly why I think this, but I really do have a good reason! I believed that, I felt it strongly, but couldn't prove that I wasn't just reacting with emotion. 

School (returning student) is only reason that I *know for a fact* that there is logic behind it. We would have practical exams where we were presented with a fake patient with symptoms xyz, and we would have to perform appropriate treatments (therapy). I'd *immediately* know the activities I wanted to have the patient do. But we had to explain ourselves! 

--What do their symotoms mean, as to what is biologically happening
--What physical principles alleviate/reverse that? 
--What kinds of movements (or whatever mode) use those principles? 
--How can you incorporate those movements into an activity?

I could backtrack to answer the first or last question the quickest, but still slowly and incoherently finding the appropriate words and unable to put them into a sentence. The further through the questions I'd try to get, the slower and blanker my brain would become. Zombie paralysis. Not out of anxiety that I might be wrong. Like a machine that's about to break, the slowing down and then seizing. Cognitive overload, I guess. 

I'd just want to say, look I'm right, does it matter if I can't explain it? It's not like I just stumbled upon a right answer - I was always right and could always provide a rationale with enough time. Plus I did so in similar written assignments, and did well on written tests (although if I had to provide multi-step rationales, I'd be furiously writing, erasing, writing, crossing out, drawing line all over my test to link different ideas that came out if order....). Anyway, my teachers knew that I studied and understood the material. But you have to explain your rationale - so that they know you understand in that instance and so that you can document properly on the job.

Anyway. That turned into a rant. Sorry it was so long! Whoops! Really?!? I’m so glad I’m not alone!!! People always think it sounds strange and don’t believe it works, it makes me really happy to know someone else does it!!!! I totally get it, if you're into South Park at all, they actually made an episode about thus: how people who try to use logic aren't forgiving of the emotional aspect. All within roasting the rapper Logic, of course.
