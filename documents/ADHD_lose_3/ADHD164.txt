What does the "right" dose feel like? I made the switch from Adderall XR to Focalin XR.  I was on 20MG Adderall (which was OK) and she put me on Focalin XR 15MG.  I guess a long time ago I  tried Focalin XR 20MG and said it was too much.  

15MG was nothing, I felt just as lackluster and unmotivated.

My doc said I cold split the tab and pour the beads into a new capsule to try a high dose.  So I split a Focalin XR 15MG in half.  Seems to be much better than the 15mg.

Just wondering what should it feel like when we are at proper dose? I don’t know about Focalin, but the right dose of Adderall for me helps me motivate and stay focused, doesn’t taper off too early, and has fewer negative side effects. Surprisingly, it’s less than the too low dose, but that may not be typical. You’ll know it’s too much stimulant when after your body settles you have negative effects like difficulty sleeping, anxiety, mood swings, lack of appetite, etc. Adjust that for the new med’s side effects, most likely. You'll never feel perfect. But life can be a bit more manageable.

My experience, in a nutshell, for what it's worth: my dad is a clinical psychologist that diagnoses learning disabilities for a living, so he was able to really observe my behaviors and make recommendations when something wasn't "working." I started on Adderrall. I bounced off the walls, making everyone question if I "really" had ADHD. Then they gave me Concerta. It was great, I was calm and focused - according to all my teachers and my parents. \*\*I\*\* didn't feel much different, but my grades were slightly higher and I wasn't forgetting things as much, so whatever. A year later, they switched me (I forget why, I was about 16 at this point) to Stratera, the non-stimulant med. I was army crawling across the living room floor 2 days later, insisting that we were under attack. (spoiler alert: we weren't.) I went back on Concerta. 

&#x200B;

When I went to college, things got harder again. My doctor pointed out that taking a 12 hour Concerta at 8 am (to be alert from my 9:00 am classes) meant it would wear off at 9 pm, so studying any later would be harder. That made sense, so he prescribed 4 hour Focalin for night-time studying, and I'd take that around 7 or 8 pm, if needed, so it sorta overlapped.

Focalin was AMAZING. I'd get so much done! For the first time ever, I could FEEL what others said I was like on Concerta - I really did concentrate and focus and wasn't constantly distracted! I went to my doctor and asked him about using Focalin full-time. 

&#x200B;

At that time (this was maybe 10 years ago? Maybe a little less, but regardless, this is what I was told by the doctor, so I just assume it was true then), I was told that Focalin only came in 4 hour and 8 hour versions, not 12 like my Concerta. I felt it was so effective that I insisted on trying the 8 hour. For whatever reason, it made me grumpy, irritable, and a total witch. (At the time, I insisted the entire first week that I was fine, and everyone else was just irritating. It was only after my parents forcibly made me stop taking the 8-hour Focalin that, in hindsight, I realized, "Oh. It WAS me, not them!")

Throughout law school and later in grad school, I relied on my Concerta and then the 4 hour Focalin as needed. I now also take Zoloft for my anxiety and depression, which helps, but I do feel like Focalin is more effective for me. However, it's impractical to take it throughout the day (like I could remember that?!), so I take Concerta in the morning and 4 hr Focalin as needed.

I don't feel like Concerta is as effective, but whenever I don't take it, there's a noticeable difference. Any car accident I've ever been in, or losing my keys or wallet or phone, was when I didn't take my Concerta.  I went to high and had horrible withdrawals whenever I didn’t take my meds. Then I went one down and it was perfect. That’s how I figured out my correct dose. The right dose won’t fix everything but it will make it a lot easier.  Good points, manage to the side effects.  The "focus" is the issue I am dealing with right now, I feel the energy, but I cannot remain focused on one task.  Constantly looking for a way out. Just a note on the sleeping: Some people get to sleep better with a bit of stimulant still in their system, because it helps with executive function and keeps racing thought tangles at bay.

If you can't sleep because you feel jittery and "wired," it's probably the medication keeping you up.  If you can't sleep because your thoughts won't quiet down, it may be rebound from the medication wearing off, and you may just need to find some pre-bed rituals or a small dose of stimulant to help you out in the evenings. "Constantly looking for a way out". My god that sums up my ADD distraction. For me, the problem isn't falling asleep, it is waking up, typically I am extremely groggy when I wake up and meds + coffee get me going.

I was trying Magnesium supps, but they gave me really bad nightmares. Ive had this too, quit caffeine and now i wake
 up with energy and a clear head
