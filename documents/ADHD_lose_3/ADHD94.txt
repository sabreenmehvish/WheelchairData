ADHD mess in China? Help ! I can't find any... Meds that is What avenues have you already exhausted?  [deleted] Did you renounce US citizenship? I'm down, I went to China last winter. I only got meds in Vietnam but they didn't have adderall only Concerta. No duloxetine only venlafaxine.

Anyway, bullshit restrictions and meddling and freedom tampering everywhere. Can confirm, parents think that my Straterra is a cure-all and scream at me and tell me I'm completely useless when I hyperfocus and can't get shit done.

They think ADHD isn't a big problem. *IT IS.* It makes every minute of my life a big struggle. Hell, it's 2:44AM right now and I should be asleep? Why not? Because I stayed up until 2AM.

To work on a small text based game. I have a full day of exams tomorrow ahead of me. And I'm lying here on bed and on reddit.

Someone, please, help me. Won't they ever understand? They lose it when I forget where my pen was, then losing my mind only to find out it was besides me the whole time.

I don't know how I can convince them. Why do they think my meds will cure-all? Is there any med that cures all? To make my life stop being such a pain in the ass? So that I won't forget stuff over and over and forget to do something I told myself I will finish in half an hour, only to find out I've spent 5 hours and I've done nothing at all?

In fact, they just did it after dinner. They told me I needs to revise for Science tomorrow. It took me 2 hours to print my set of notes. I didn't revise and I fell asleep on my desk, notes still on the printer tray.

I'm actually kind of disappointed with myself now. What have I done? Is it something I could've done to stop this giant fuckup? Can you please tell me? If it's something I change I am willing to do anything to change it. Absolutely anything.

...oh look. I've done it again. Sorry. [deleted] ... but I can't. I'm too young (14) and if I don't listen to what they say all hell breaks lose.
