I feel like I’m gonna kill my self I don’t know what to do, I’m so lost. 

Please help if you can, and I’m sorry for my English, Ik it’s awkward, and thoughts are not organized.

I always thought I was smart, not just smart but a genius, someone who will truly change the world. I proved it to everyone when I was the first student ever to go to a national science fair/competition. Intel, google, IBM were the sponsor, and I placed first, I was even invited to work with professor at my top choice university. But still didn’t change my problem. 

No homework, like none. When I was gr9 to 11 I told myself it’s not gr12 it’s fine university won’t look at it. When grade 12 came as you expected I DID NOTHING. I hated myself, everyday I know what to do, I make a plan for it and in a blink, I was snoozing the alarm so I can get 5 minutes more of sleep time before I go to school. First semester in grade 12 I ended up with like a 85 and I told myself “if I get a 100% on my other classes I can still fix this and get into my top choice” Of course I didn’t, I had 2 bad tests and I gave up. I accepted that I will not go to university, I started planning on how I’m gonna tell my parents. I moved on since and I decided to retake everything and really try; I choose to go to gr12(only choice really). In the summer I researched a lot about this problem and I digeonst myself with ADD, I went to the doctor and he came up with the same conclusion, ADD. He started me on 30mg Vyvasen, it was amazing at first, I cleaned my room, I even started reading a book. School started again, and I started going to school with kids younger than me, I hated myself so much, I kept telling myself it was temporary, that I only needed to do this for few months and I can go on to change the world. Now in gr12 I did bad on my first test, I didn’t care too much because I can I told myself I will fix it. After few weeks it got worse, i didn’t do anything I went to the doctor and he changed the dosage to 40mg and then 50mg. And here we are with 5 late labs for my physics and chemistry, and a three zeros in calculus assessments. I don’t feel vyvasrn anymore either, even today I tried to take to at once 100mg nothing, like I haven’t taking anything, not even the sickness or the “robotic” feeling. I just don’t know what to do. And I don’t know anymore, I’m crying everyday, yesterday I just kept hitting my head I don’t know I just needed something to change. I just don’t know what’s going on with my life, I’m losing everything. I hate it, I hate it so much, it’s like hell, I just want to sleep and never wake up. I just can’t anymore, I just need it to be over already.  I relate.


*My experience*

________

**Perfectionism:**

Knowledge of our abilities to learn, that we're able to actually be very good at something, we don't want it to be a "waste". Want it to be used in the most important way as possible.


Our need to be the perfect version of ourselves, sometimes we are trying so hard, which leads to just feeling worse. 


________


**Extreme empathy:**

Always been able to understand which current state of feelings a person is experiencing. Understanding the pain that feelings can cause, and the happiness we want people to feel. Together with the knowledge that one can be very good at something, something that could help others, but being slowed down and made harder, might put one in despair. 


You seem to be a very good person, having a need to help people. Excellent. You will find your calling eventually. Perhaps a line of work where you help others is very suiting for you. 


I myself, am reading engineering, this because I know I'm both able and knowing technology can be a way to help many at the same time. At the moment I'm not sure because I don't enjoy it properly, but knowing what changes it can make, I feel stuck in a decision. 

________


**Depression:**

There can be a pattern of similar thoughts that occur, and a similar reaction that we have to these thoughts. These thoughts can hold one in the state of sadness and anxiety.

Take your time and focus on understanding negative thoughts. Understand which thoughts are not necessary, and do accept them. Ask yourself, why you have these thoughts, but at the same time, accept them. Bothering thoughts occur multiple times because they're thoughts that bother us. Our body sees these thoughts as importance, but only your conscious can truly learn to understand what they mean. When you do that and accept that they're just thoughts, it will get better. 

I myself experience a lot of intrusive thoughts. I'm improving by using methods for the OCD variant called Pure O (pure obsession, no physical compulsions, only mental ones which are spiraling thoughts).


________


**Vyvanse:**

Vyvanse is very calm for me, I don't notice when it starts or goes out. All I know is that I get more depressed when it goes out, a lot of thoughts start spiraling which makes me suicidal. Most times I don't even have the time to tell myself; I'm experiencing a crash, be mindful.

Depression and anxiety can hinder the effects of stims.

Also, use it wisely my friend. I understand, you're just trying to feel better again.  Wow the pressure you are under! Astounding. Who told you were so smart. Who put this pressure on you? 

And why do you want to change the world? Who told you this is a worthy goal? That is nonsense. You need to let that go. Now.

The world is fine as it is. It doesn't need your intervention. I can go on Youtube and watch 1001 Ted talks and half of them have people who say they 'want to change the world'. This is insanity, madness. No one of these bozo's will ever succeed. 

You know, my older brother never left the nest. He was always told he was social and smart, so intelligent. He got the crap kicked out of him for that. In those days a series about black slaves was on tv. 'Roots'.  They used my (white) brother as a slave to replay the series in the school yard, laid him down and would brutalize him. Because he was the little professor who would point out and show off how smart he was. Had he been really smart, he would have shut the fuck up. But maybe he is autistic, chances are, he is, as I am.

What use is IQ? It is not a measurement of happiness. You think CEO's of big 'world changing corporations' are happy? No. Suffering scales with responsibilities. So maybe you need to get a shrink and get your head shrunk because dude, you ain't need to change no friggin' world. You should try to be happy.

You know what? 

**"It is perfectly obvious that the whole world is going to hell. The only possible chance that it might not is that we do not attempt to prevent it from doing so."**
- J. Robert Oppenheimer

No wonder you are depressed. What would a man be required and capable of to be like Atlas, who carries the world on his shoulders? 

The FIRST thing you need to do is stop fucking around with the meds. More is not merrier. You are juist overloading your brain and your brain chemistry is totally fucked up now. You need to quit your meds pronto, then see your doctor. Your brain needs rest and a reset from medications. 

And after that you need to have a long chat with yourself about your delusions of grandeur. One of these days you need to learn to think for yourself, not basing your life on the expectations of others. I have an IQ too  you know, but this ADHD/ASD combo disables me in profound ways. With my verbal IQ I should be able to write what americans would call the 'next great american classic'. Not that I am an american. But I can't write. I have the talent, the depth, the insight in character progression. Maybe one day.

But even if I did, my Great Werx is never gonna change the world. parents need to stop filling their kids with such bullcrap nonsense. It is too much pressure and sets you up for failure. No man ever changed the world. All people are propelled to gain positions by the Zeitgeist, by the circumstance of presence, the right place and the wrong time. No one hero ever studied or asked for it, but was regarded as such while they think they just did their job. And that is true.

Be more humble because that is the only greatness anyone can ever hope to achieve that has any worth and meaning. The only way to change the world is by changing yourself. For ultimately you are the world and the worst things that comes out of a human being is carried on a golden chariot of good intentions. 

 Man I'm really sorry. I've been through the same stuff. There are times when things can get tough. When you feel like a lonely rose growing from a planet of dark concrete. I know exactly how you feel. Like every is going to end. But you know what. You gotta push trough. And remember and remind yourself that you're not alone and that there are others who are struggling as well. Life is hard but it's so worth it. Every second of it is beautiful, and so are you man. We need you, the world needs you.  First: If you feel you are a danger to yourself right now, call a suicide hotline or your countries emergency phone # immediately. This isn't impossible to make it through, but you need to be safe and calm to deal with it.

Second: You should realize that you are suffering from depression and it's very serious. This isn't you, this is depression. It controls so much of your thoughts and actions without you even knowing it.

It makes you doubt yourself, hate yourself, blame yourself, lose the motivation to do the things you want to do, forget that you care about anything, lose the energy to get out of bed. It makes it hard to remember that you are a great person underneath it. It can get better, but you can't ignore it. This is the thing you are trying to change but haven't been able to. You need to understand it and get the help you need to face it and overcome it.

Depression also makes the ADHD medication lose its effectiveness. Taking excessive dosages is also dangerous and is not going to make you feel better. It's going to make it worse every day after. It doesn't matter if you can think more clearly if the only thing you are able to think about is how upset and sad you are and can't feel anything but pain. You need to work on getting back a better place of emotional stability before it can work the way it should.

You obviously care about your achievements, and you have goals you want in life. ADHD can make it more difficult to stay on track but is something you can deal with. Depression keeps you stuck at the bottom so you don't feel like you can even make progress.

The things you need to do to deal with this:

* Speak with your psychologist, doctor, or psychiatrist immediately. Schedule something right now, tell them it is an emergency because it is if you're even thinking about ending your life. If they are unavailable, see your schools counselor as soon as possible. Talk to them about your depression. Figure out how to treat it, and how to treat it quickly. Get the right medication, get help from the right therapist, and deal with the problems that are limiting you and preventing you from being happy and confident in yourself again. That person is you, it's still in there.

* I know this is hard, and you don't feel you can do it right now. So just remember it. Stop focusing on your mistakes. You need to understand it was just a hard period in your life, forgive yourself, and take the steps necessary to make it better and get back on the path you want to be on. You're smart and capable. You should understand and accept your mistakes. You can't treat your mistakes as a part of you and let them own you. They are something to learn from and become stronger for the future. Hating yourself for the past will not make your future better.

* Once you can be more calm and think more clearly, you can do what you need to so you're able to meet your goals. Speak to your school. If you explain your issues with mental illness, they will most likely be understanding and give you the opportunity to fix the mistakes or provide you extra time on your assignments. They can help you but you need to talk to them to make it happen. Some things I've heard people say is that they did that and they were allowed to turn their assignments at any time before the end of the semester. 

This isn't the end, you can come back from this. You can still have a good future. You are not a failure just because you had one bad time in your life. Focus on getting the help you need, getting to a better state of mind, and then creating a better path to accomplish your goals and dreams. You can make it happen but you need to trust in yourself and remember you can do it. It will be hard, but it will happen. 

I know how hard this is, but it's ok to say you need help. There are plenty of good people who are willing and able to help support you if you reach out and let them. Don't forget you're not alone, alright?

I hope this helps. I can't tell you I understand but all I can tell you is that you NEED TO REST YOUR MIND a little bit gosh the pressure you put on yourself is insane 12 grade is a horror if you decide to make it a horror you are worried about a ton of things thinking about a ton of things this is too much believe me 
I know I know that shutting your brain when you want to isn't always an option but don't get dragged with it every time your brain reminds you of how wrong things have been don't just follow it ignore it it's a war inside you and you don't want to quit just study for what's to come and forget about the past you can't imagine how long it's in front of you and all these moments of despair are gonna shrink 
And for god sake who told that smart people don't ruin things at school you can be both very smart and ruin everything at school please please just focus on what to come what you can't get all, don't leave it all forget all the past years and exams and concentrate on what is to come and when I say what is to come I don't mean in next 20 years because no one knows what is gonna happen in those I mean the next exam the next step you can take focus on this and please take it easy on yourself quitting is never a solution and an advice from a huge day dreamer you can't change the world but you for sure can change your life. May God help you get over your struggle and please don't hurt yourself  Please please please call the suicide hotline. Or even 911. You, and your life, is valuable, and you can get through this! The people on this subreddit as well as others in Reddit are very compassionate and are here to help, I promise! Talk to a psychiatrist.

Also, life often doesn't go as planned and that's  okay.  You can still do great things in the world.  

What do you want to do to help make the world a better place? Hey, first of all, merry almost Christmas, I don't know if you're the Christmas type or not, but it's a big thing where I am, so whatever you do or don't celebrate, I'm sending you nothing but love and good vibes

I don't know if this will help much, but about about... 5 or so Christmas's ago (specifically on boxing day, the day after) I decided I had it with everything. I failed my way through highschool, passing by the hairs on my ass, baaaaaarrely graduating on technicalities. My girlfriend at the time left me for her school, citing the distance as her main reason, but I knew it was so she could grow without me and be the kind of person I just can't. All my friends had moved on to bigger and better thing almost immedeatly after graduation and there I was, flunking through community college. So I decided to try to kill myself, but didn't fallow through at the very last minute (actually almost funny story, didn't want to die sober a la the wolf of wallstreet, so I got too stoned to figure out how a noose worked) anyway, I had completely submitted to the idea it will never get better, and I am doomed to be this shitty person who can't do anything right

Sadly, I don't know exactly what contributed to me being where I am today, but I couldn't be happier. My idea of success was so narrow and defined by other people back then, but telling a fish to climb a tree and calling him dumb cause he can't doesn't make any sense. I had to redefine what it is I wanted to achieve and why, now I'm moved out, going to school for my dream carreer, genuinely enjoying as much of life as I can. 

I have the utmost faith in you that you'll find your path and you will find a way to make yourself happy and feel like a successful person. We just can't have the highs without the lows sometimes. I believe in you. Take a step back and take some things off of your plate. That is so much pressure to allow yourself to deal with. There's nothing wrong with taking on less if it means you can move forward in your life. Are you sure you weren't hitting your head because of autism? I can private message you a great tutor to help you finish your assignments. Also when you stop taking stimulants it tends to make you even lazier than before. I recommend trying something else like tumeric for cardio, or a natural energy supplement. Or yoga, it helps with cardio too. Stop fucking around with stimulants, it's not like they're going to pass exams for you. You are clearly addicted, you need to take your time and sober up.  If you are in danger of hurting/killing yourself please tell someone (parents or a doctor) immediately. Even if you're not, talk to your doctor. Look into therapists. You're depressed and need help.

Look. I feel you. I've been there, and in some ways I'm still there.

You're not losing everything. Life is long. It's so damn long, and there will be so many chances for you to make changes. There is no single path in life to success. And I know that sounds cheesy, and I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's true.

Clearly you are smart and when it comes to the right thing you can do the work. The dream of making an impact on the world is not dead. You can find a way there that works for you.
