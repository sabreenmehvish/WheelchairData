Oh no I’m so mad So I leave like 50 tabs open and a minute ago I accidentally closed all the tabs I needed those now I’m gonna forget :( How come you had 50 tabs open? Seems like you go on loads of websites. It must hurt to have them all closed now. Hope you remember most of the tabs you had open.  You can just go to history and say “reopen closed tabs” Because I like the things that were on them and now I’m gonna forget :( 

It seems petty but I wanna cry rn I sound like a baby I know :( Found the non-adhd person. Hahaha

Out of curiosity, how many tabs do non-adhd people have open?   25-50 and several windows is fairly common for me. I can’t I deleted my history too :( Don’t worry, you’re not a baby. It’s normal to be upset when you lose things you like. I have accidentally closed tabs on my phone internet which I wanted to keep open and I felt a bit angry/upset about it too. Even though I don’t have ADHD, I can still relate to your situation.  I normally have 1 open. Sometimes I can have up to 5 open, but that is it. 50 to me, is far too many tabs. You are right, I don’t have ADHD but I can still help, if and when it’s needed.  Ok how is this possible? Im so sad for you. I know how this feels. Im sometimes googling something ”embarrassing” on incognito—mode and have dozens tabs open. Usually some are wikipedia articles when I want to know every new word and thing etc. I find.

 Then I accidently close the browser and lose all tabs. But its ok. I cant remember what they all were so im not that sad XD  That sucks! :-( 

Hope you can get all your stuff back.  Yeah it is frustrating I’m crying now you say I’m not a baby but should a 16 year old be crying about lost tabs?

They had stuff I wanted to see and stuff I had to do like a item I wanted from the store and now I don’t remember it’s name or what it was :( Omg. What is that like?  Even with meds, I have fewerr open but it’s still way too many. 
This is our (well, a lot of us, can’t speak for all) normal. So to us it’s different to not consistently have so many tabs open 

For adhd ppl, we move subject to subject and them might hop back 2-3 subjects then forward 1 and back 5.  

Do you close them as soon as you’re done or do you just not move forward tot he tangentially related topics like we do? 

Glad you’re here to help!  I’m probably just as curious to know what it’s like to have adhd as you are what it’s like to have it. I’m on iPhone I went to the Safari app and accidentally clicked erase all data and history :( Yeah same  The next time you want to get an item from a store, maybe write it down somewhere like in a notebook or on a piece of paper, so then if you accidentally close a tab and lose it all, at least you’ll have the item name to type into Google to help you find it again. I know it might sound a little tedious but if you don’t want to hand write it, type it up on your computer or on a note app on your phone. FYI, I still cry every now and then and I’m 18, so you’re not a baby for crying at 16. Even though losing tabs and forgetting it all is just annoying to me but not a big deal, I understand for some people it’s not. I know how you’re feeling but don’t dwell on the lose too much, you’re bound to find it again another day.  Yeah. I have Asperger’s but I can understand people better than others. I feel like a normal person (you know, someone with a medical condition) because I’m treated that way (though I’m some cases I do feel like that I’m treated differently). I don’t flick from 1 topic to another that quickly but sometimes I can go on a tangent and write an essay or talk for hours about something which I’m interested in. For example, I like watching movies and I’m a big Marvel fan. So when someone talks about Marvel with me, I could talk about it for hours. And I normally close a tab once I’m finished with it.  Yeah your right thank you so much  It’s okay. I always like to make people feel better when they are upset. I used to have a friend with ADHD so I know what it’s like. I know how rapid your emotions can change and how annoyed/ upset you can get by little things but to you it’s a big deal.  Yeah it isn’t 


That’s cool you had a friend with adhd I have two people I know who have adhd my friend and my boyfriend  Cool.😎 They also understand and get you and probably have similar experiences as yourself as well.  Yeah they do especially my bf 


Well i gotta stop crying now it’s doing me no good hopefully I’ll remember again  I’m sure you will. Even if you don’t, either start writing it down somewhere or save it in your favourites. Then if you delete your history, at least it’ll all be in your favourites. If you use WIFI on your phone, save it to your home screen (it won’t take up any storage, it’s only a website) or add it to your bookmarks (favourites but the mobile version).  Ok yeah thanks :) No problem. Always happy to help when it’s needed.
