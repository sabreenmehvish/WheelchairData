Win some you lose some. Gonna write this in point form for easy reading.
- Sunday driving after a good time with friends.
- notice that my fuel is low.
- ohno.jpeg 
- Kinda tired and late, just do it next time.
- Sometime in the middle of going to sleep "I'm gonna forget about this" pops into head.
- Starts hyperfocusing on waking up on time. 
- Litterally gets maybe 6 hours instead of normal 10 after forgetting then getting diracted why I was so focused. (Thanks reddit!)
- Wake up sharp
-Gets prepared faster than usual, think nothing of it.
- Go to gas station just like how I planned.
- Check time before i go to classes.
- 10 mins early (noice)
-Decide to go classes early like a good boi, cause I was so proud.
- Get to train station, get out from car.
- Forgot all school related items at home. 

 Why is it always like this.
