Saying to myself outloud "i am waking up now and getting out of bed" has actually helped me so much! I've been trying to regulate my behaviour using my external voice rather than my inner voice. As Dr. Russell Barkley points out, for many people with ADHD our inner voices are quite weak. This explains why all the mornings of arguing with myself in my head to get out of bed hasn't worked!

Simply saying the action I want to take out loud makes all the difference! Curious if anyone else has tried this üòä it seems weird, but I'm amazed at how well it works when I remember to implement it!

  


**Update**

Thanks for the great reaponses reddit! So many great tips and strategies!

Im highlighting a few comments that i felt expanded well on my original comment :) I will post the users name with their suggestion and then their original comment copied under

u/ckaili suggests narrating your current actions take away performance anxiety

>"In accordance with your original original post, I personally find it even more effective to say something like 'I am now putting the bag of chips away,' so as to completely take away any room for mental negotiation that might happen between 'right now' and 'I will \[in the future\] do something.'¬† For whatever reason, narrating my current actions takes away performance anxiety and I can just mindlessly perform the action without the internal turbulence."

&#x200B; I'm telling y'all this works, whatever gets spun up in your head can't get all spun up and debilitate you if you just say, shout, sing, or write it out of your head After mindlessly sitting in the car for over an hour instead of going into the grocery store, I‚Äôve yelled ‚Äúget the fck out of the car!!!‚Äù To myself.. probably looked crazy but it finally got me up.  I'll do this for a day then forget to do it. I wish my inner voice was weak, my inner voice is a fucking ass sometimes.

That being said, I enjoy counting down from 10 and getting out of bed before I reach zero. I do this in other situations too when I'm in a rush. Also useful when needing to remember things like if you closed the front door or not. After you've done it shout it out and say "THE FRONT DOOR IS CLOSED" and you'll (hopefully) have a better chance at remembering you did it. I use something similar which has hugely helped me. I think it was from Descartes "if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it now". Just get off your arse and do it. Pick the shit up lying about. Do the dishes. Load a laundry. Rub the ketchup stain off the light switch. Make your bed

Dont think of the chaos as a whole. Just incrementally make small changes which you are more tham capable of. What little task which really isn't that bloody difficult that you can do in 2 mins. Aim to do x amount of these little tasks a day. 

These small efforts led to me taking more control of my life.  I do this so frequently when I am dealing with executive dysfunction. I am much more inclined to do something when I am told to, versus just having the knowledge that I OUGHT to. Once I became a grown up and there was no one saying "Get out of bed" or "Finish up your work", etc., I found it really difficult to find any obligatory action, regardless of importance, stimulating enough to actually do it. The mental game of acting like my external voice is my boss or a parent telling me what to do is stimulating enough for me to actually get shit done. Plus when I am having difficulty doing something and I command myself to do it out loud, my fiance knows that this is a cue that I need a little more motivation or stimulation, and he ends up encouraging me as well, which is even more helpful. I do this. Usually, it's just "Upsie Daisy!" because apparently sometimes i'm 4 [deleted] Something that‚Äôs helped me is to immediately make the bed when I stand up. Or at least put the sheets up where they should be. This is a signal to myself that says ‚ÄúI am now done with the bed and can move on‚Äù.  I think my internal voice is plenty strong, but there are too many of them for the adult one to be heard among the rest. One voice says get up and several others ares saying, "it feels so good just laying here", "you have plenty of time", and "went to bed late so I deserve to sleep in". I like to count down when i don't feel motivated to do something, i try to hype myself up as much as possible in a 10 second count down. If it started working I‚Äôd just stop saying it Yes! This! It also works when my anxious thoughts start to ruminate and just become completely irrational. I will say out loud ‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù Or ‚Äúenough!‚Äù  I read this while in bed, wondering why it was so hard to get up. Now I'm going about my day! Thanks everyone! Too many comments to read so this might have already been said (and I only read the title) but...


**DO A COUNTDOWN!**

Seriously that's my favourite thing to do. I'll lie in bed and count 10, 9, 8, 7 etc and by the time I get to 1 I have to jump out. Sometimes I find it wasn't enough numbers and I'll go 10, 9, 8... no 30, 29, 28 etc and start higher up :D 


But yeah maybe that will help some of you Thank you for the tip, I'll try it in 5am when I'll push myself to wake up to the BJJ class at 6 üò• Also saying "im going to wake up early and get straight to  work" a few times before bed helped me get up in the mornings too if any one wants to try that  This is my greatest struggle.  Simply getting up in the morning. I have had so many meetings with my manager.   Yes, 100%! It's especially useful when I am paralyzed feeling like I need to imagine my future actions precisely before I can actually execute them.  Funny thing is, it works so well that I'm sometimes afraid to use it because I don't want it to ever lose its power. Let me proceed by telling myself in my head to tell myself out loud to do things!  I've started talking to myself out loud (and to my dogs) all the time. I also sing to myself, especially if I'm transitioning between tasks or going to a different room, to prevent "doorway amnesia." Like, "going to get the peanut butter, doo dee doo." Worth a shot for me too. Thanks for sharing! Interesting concept.  I will have to give it a try.   My dad tight me to say that before bed and fuck does it work....  I do! I say "Now you are going to finish this thing, and THEN, for heaven's sake, EAT!" I usually have to do it when I need to re-focus or when I need to force a transition (stop to eat or stop to go to the restroom). TFI, i'll try it out.  I‚Äôm gonna try this. Nearly every day I mentally tell myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get up early so I‚Äôm at work early instead of rushing‚Äù and that literally has not happened.  Interesting! 

My internal voice tends to be more conversational (*should I get up now or hit snooze?*) but I've found using an authoritative internal command, I can will myself up (GET UP). Not like angry, like *this is happening NOW.* 

Thanks and I look forward to trying this! Yes! I've tried this for a considerable time to get me motivated for the day. I got out of bed, went to the bathroom, and just before showering I looked into the mirror and told myself: "I'm strong, I'm healthy and I'm full of energy". To really get that motivation going, it had to be the first thing I did in the morning, and although it was kinda awkward in the beginning, that surpassed after a couple of days, and I found it to really help my mood. I see people saying they can‚Äôt get out of bed I‚Äôm the opposite I can I‚Äôm energized and jump out of bed almost every morning  This would have helped a lot this morning haha.  
Right now I have an alarm that doesn't shut off unless you scan a barcode, but It has a good chance of waking up family members and you're forced to basically delete the app if you forget to turn it off (since there is no snooze function)  
I should try this since I really want to be able to get up when I need to without waking up my entire family in the process When I had a extremely hard time getting started, I would pray out loud asking my inner slave to straighten up. I now believe praying is really a form of self talk. Thanks for he tip! For studying, the only thing that works for me is reading out loud and reciting information as if I was explaining it to someone.  So glad it is working. I feel as people with ADHD we focused on so many things in our heads we lost the ability for simple everyday routines.  I always wonder if this relates to dopamine, because apparently it helps Parkinson‚Äôs patients to dance or have music on. It helps their movements be more regular and controlled.  For remembering stuff, it helps me if I also tell myself how many things to remember. Like if I'm going to the store for bread, bananas, and peanut butter then I'll tell myself, "You need to get 3 things." Then if I only have 2 things in my cart, I know there's 1 more thing I gotta remember.

This is really effective if it's an errand where I both pick something up and drop something off, or when I need to go to multiple places. such a great idea!! I'm going to try that! 

&#x200B; Gonna try this! It‚Äôs def been useful for stopping negative thought spirals with an ‚Äúok stop!!‚Äù. Never thought about using it for other stuff! I literally started doing something similar just this week! I love going to be early and I inevitably leave things for the morning that I should do at night, but then the morning comes around and I forget all the promises I made to myself the night before, and so I set an early alarm, bu then laze about in bed for an hour, of course.

So I've started going to bed and saying things like "I am waking up at 5:30 because I have to pack my bag." "I have to leave the house at 6:30 to get petrol." "I have to wash my hair in the morning."

Way better than leaving myself notes or reminders which I manage to ignore/forget 100% :) Sing like Ritchie Valens "Come on, come on let's go little darlin'!... Come on, lets go!...." Lol this fucken helps me for sure but I feel crazy sometimes. Sometimes I have to no shit talk to myself through certain mundane tasks but it seriously makes me remember. Holy shit. It worked.  I've read as well to avoid using words like "no, don't , won't, etc) our brains don't process negative words as well so it ends up blocking them out. "Don't eat those chips" becomes "eat those chips". 

So rather saying what you want to do instead can help. Like saying "I will put the bag of chips away" I do this all of the time.  I‚Äôll park and read my phone in my car for an hour.  Why?!  I‚Äôve got to try this out loud method.   That's the tricky part! It's always been my struggle with cognitive therapy, or trying to build new habits. 
I can't stop long enough before I act to recall the strategies I've put in place. Medication helps a lot  this not fool proof. Or perhaps I haven't found the magical dose yet. 

Some tips Barkley recommends is to try and make a physical motion to remind you to stop. Like making a zipping motion to stop before you speak, or something. But again...that requires that you can remember to do that motion in the moment XD

I guess that's part of building a new habit though. Just keep doing it when you remember to, and when you realize you forgot to hold on to that and do it as soon as the next moment to use the strategy comes :)  set an alarm on your phone that goes off every day, and when you hear it, practice this technique! that's something I've tried before that works ok for me.  The voice telling me to do the things I Need to do is soooo weak but the adhd voice telling me not to do anything important and focus on some random task is very strong I do this and I do it outloud from 3. It works for me 85% of the time. I just have to remember to do it is the problem now haha Maybe try a clock radio and turn it to a channel the has some positive, cheerful music.  You don't want to wake up to angry, hateful ranting because it just won't motivate you to look forward to the day. Oh my gosh! Thank you for this! I don't know what that didn't occur to me before XD definitely trying this! Lol it really does help even if I sometimes feel like a sports announcer for my own life. 

Maybe I should do that instead actually. "and now glitchinthemeowtrix is waking up and starting her morning at 6:30!! This is an interesting play after last week when she slept in until 7:45. Always a risky move considering she starts work at 8am. And she's out of bed and - wow! will you look at that! she swerves right past the couch and goes straight to her desk! Its unprecedented! We haven't seen a motivational play like this from her in weeks! Now, I don't want to jinx anything but if she drinks her tea before it gets cold I think we're in for a good game folks. Tune in after halftime we'll see if she manages to make AND eat lunch before 2pm. Brought to you by Dexedrine. When your brain is bad at doing stuff try, Dexedrine." I do this when I unplug the iron. It helps a lot.  "Rub the ketchup stain off the light switch" üòÇ 

I feel ya Yup! This tip has been super helpful for me as well! I've started by applying it to my work inbox. If I can reply to is in two minutes do so now. If not, either flag it and move it to a TO DO folder for later, or  archive if you need to reference it again later, or delete it. 

It has helped me keep my inbox to 0 which makes it much less overwhelming and much easier to find emails when I need to!  Sometimes when I want to procrastinate, I ask myself, *these dishes will need to be done eventually, why *not* now?*. It sounds like coming up with an excuse not to do them, but if one has trouble with executive function prioritizing can be stressful. And this little question helps me figure out if I'm really procrastinating.

Also lately I'm thinking of chores as a gift I'm giving to my future self. *I don't feel like doing those dishes, but wouldn't future Won'tLieToYou just love it to have an empty sink*?  Definitely! I agree so much to the acting like a "boss or parent". I can do anything when someone is there telling me what to do. But try to do it on my own and I fall apart. I realized this when I got a personal trainer. I didn't realize how far I could push my body until I had someone there telling me what to do, and telling me to keep going XD  Haha love it! Who cares if it's helping you! At most those people will be temporarily weirded out but they will forget it and you will have been able to work towards breaking a habit you want to break :) 

I haven't figured how to try it yet, but Barkley recommends pretending like your on the phone if you need to talk outloud in public, things like that that will be less alarming to the general public XD Thats awesome! Little rituals like that are super helpful! I do this too! (19 years old, ADD) My bed is now always the best looking of mine and my two siblings beds (one with ADD, the other without anything).
Our mom is so proud of me for this! I never used to make the bed but now that the dog has peed on the sheets I never forget. Solution for others, get a poorly trained dog! ;) All true for me too, but then the voice that says, "Do you want to keep this job or not?" Chimes in, and no other thought of comfort or time matters.  I am up and out the door - hair still wet and all. I've been doing this too! I always confused my husband because I'll randomly shout "no!" when I start having intrusive negative thoughts :D One thing I have trouble with is going to bed early.  If I get less than 5 hours sleep, a freight train with full horn could run through my bedroom and I'd still sleep through it. That's great advice! Definitely going to try that tonight üòä Id like to update my original post with this advice if thats okay with you! :) I actually started taking an SSRI because it became so chronic for me. There are definitely still mornings where my body chemistry just ain't there. 

It's not your fault just find what works for you! Maybe that's speaking to your doctor about having a special accomodation for arriving to work at a certain time.  I recently installed Alarmy (think I learned about it here actually), this is an app that won't turn off until you take a specific photo.

For example, often I waste a lot of time in the morning getting my Bluetooth speakers to sync, so to remind myself to check that, the alarm doesn't turn off till I photograph my Bluetooth settings menu. (I also chose this to remind myself that getting ready for the day often requires stuff beyond clothes, food and grooming, so I really *do* need to allot plenty of time before starting work.) Love this! I need to do that more often! Doorway amnesia is a real struggle for me XD  I am gonna try this. I sing to myself in the mornings when I actually do wake up on time. I work from home and am self employed so it's easy to not wake up. It's almost not required of me but I find my days go better when I do. I have never tried to as the method to get out of bed then because I usually am just singing because I am in such a happy mood. Maybe that will kick start that process. This is why my morning alarm is Lift Yourself by Kanye. ‚ÄúLift yourself upon your feet, let‚Äôs get it on.‚Äù In accordance with your original original post, I personally find it even more effective to say something like "I am now putting the bag of chips away," so as to completely take away any room for mental negotiation that might happen between "right now" and "I will \[in the future\] do something."  For whatever reason, narrating my current actions takes away performance anxiety and I can just mindlessly perform the action without the internal turbulence. This works with remembering stuff too. 

For example, you go to the grocery store and say to yourself ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget the bread,‚Äù you inevitably always forget the bread, right? Because your brain only hears ‚Äúforget the bread, forget the bread.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember X‚Äù is much more effective. So I always make it a habit to tell myself 

REMEMBER THE BREAD

REMEMBER THE BREAD

REMEMBER THE BREAD

:) I've actually been trying this when I need to sit down and do my hw. Its really been helping me be productive  Can relate too much.  I remember the story of which beast you feed the most will become stronger.  I have fed the adhd/unsure/sabotage beast too much. But it's true saying what you want to do aloud helps break the spell. Ugh omgsh yes! Although I usually find the"ADHD" voice isn't a voice at all. That's part of the problem. It just takes over with little awareness on my behalf XD  on a good day I catch myself and am able to go back to the important task...but that's on a good day!  Good suggestion! I've lately been waking up to music that makes me want to move. Something upbeat that makes my body want to dance üòÅ Ha that was great, do you write for a living? Would be funny to see other peoples reactions when doing that. \*slowly turns head to shamefully stare at lightswitch\* üò¨ For some odd reason I find waking up before 6am mih easier than after üòÆ Ofc! Alarmy sounds so terribly irritating!  Thank you, I will look into this.  I work from home too and struggle so much! Definitely going to try it! I love the idea of singing in the morning to help wake up! :D It's kind of why I've started playing fun upbeat music that makes me want to dance. Once my body starts moving and grooving I start to wake up! But It only works if I'm awake enough to even realize there is music...sometimes I wake up so groggy I completely ignore it...Still working on that.  Yes! You worded that perfectly! Mind if I update my original post with that advice? I think it's very important üòä if I remember to. My phone is almost dead and I'm currently walking outside XD many things can happen. I will myself out loud!  Id like to update my origibal post with your comment if thats okay! :D its a greay tip! That's great! :D It's strange how something so simple can be so affective! I feel like people are always trying to give us these complicated strategies to help us get things done, when it's often something simple and easy to implement!

My husband who is in th tech industry told me about a method that programmers use to problem solve. They call it something like "talking to a rubber ducky" and so they will have a rubber ducky on their desk, and when they have a particularly hard problem, they work throughout it out loud to the rubber ducky üòÅ Lol yeah I'm a full-time writer actually, but I write about boring techy stuff so maybe this would help make it more interesting for me.  LOL...yeah it is. But so far it has helped me get out of bed.  I usually try and put some uptempo bass heavy music. I don't know how much truth there is to it but bass heavy music is supposed to give feelings of confidence. On a recent trip I picked up a friend and we listened to some very bass heavy music when our of nowhere he just said "I feel so fucking tough!"      Few months later I read about that study and that moment made sense to me. Also I tried it this morning said get up and I was up before 11! Not that early but gotta take your accomplishments no matter how small. I don't mind at all! Love it idea!
