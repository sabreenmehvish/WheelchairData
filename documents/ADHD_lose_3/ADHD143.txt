So.. I go to my psych appointment this morning, forgot to take my meds. I mention this to her and she laughs and says she knows - I had been jumping all over the place. I leave, get b&e roll, realise I forgot to pay psych, pay psych, forget to pay for roll. ðŸ˜‚ Also I asked her to write a new script because I thought I had no repeats when I actually had 2 left. Oh dear. Lol My girlfriend once had a fun little chuckle because I have an alarm on my watch to go off when I need to take my second dose of the day (and it is imperative that I hit snooze if I am in the middle of something). Well, I turned it off at 1pm, got on a tangent with a research paper (which led to other related, then unrelated topics) that I really enjoyed writing and forgot to take them. As she aptly put it "I forgot to take the meds which help prevent distraction because I got distracted."

Fun times, fun times... haha

I had to get a pill separater thing because I kept forgetting if I had taken them or not (I could see it in my head, but I don't trust the visual, it could be any day or just imaginary) and I would either not take it, or end up taking it twice. Either way, not a fun day.

&#x200B; You can't make this shit up.

Translate your headline into motor skills and yeah you found me.

The clutzery you just went through is about the equivalent of me slamming a shoulder into a door frame, looking back in shock and dropping my phone, picking it up, walking to my desk then twisting my ankle on a flat floor a few steps later. One of those days, i admire your ability to accept yourself for who you are and laugh about it, working on doing the same thing for myself. Still too hard on myself sometimes. When I went to pick up my meds prescription I was distracted the whole time with an Amazon package I had and then left my backpack at the rite aid. The pharmacist called me to come pick it up.  I forgot to pay for my psych too lmao!! They werenâ€™t thrilled Amazing! "it could be any day or just imaginary"
Well if that ain't the most relatable thing I've read all day lol.

I can vividly make fake memories on demand... that is what years of trying to remember the who what when where and why of 5 minutes ago has done to me. So yeah my whole life is set up to leave proof of itself.



 Does ADHD cause clumsiness too? It wouls explain so much  I always think it is hilarious when people try to be hard on me or insult me... they are crap at it compared to what I say/do to myself just to get everything done in the day. She actually mentioned that Iâ€™d been putting myself down when I was talking about learning design skills for my current subject at uni. She said she was sad because Iâ€™m a bright woman. 

So even though I do laugh about it, Iâ€™m still very much on the same path as yourself :) weâ€™ve just conditioned ourselves over the years. Mine was definitely as a result of feeling inadequate - having to put too much time into what should have taken half the time. That sort of thing. 

We got this! Hahahaha that made me laugh. I did that at the doctors the other day and then I almost missed my appointment. Sheâ€™d called my name too many times due to me trying to find a pic to send someone on my phone.  I always try to do that first. helps me a lot. Yeah i started using a pill separator too, it really doesnt help that im prescribed benzos for my anxiety, as it just worsens my working memory, but ive had success since i started using it. That describes so many of the issues I've had lol Don't think it's a direct cause but there's heavy correlation. During my testing I was told to stand up, close my eyes, stick my tongue out, hold my arms out and be still for 30 seconds. I almost fell over several times. 

Another while standing - one arm down at rest, the other "reach up and screw in an imaginary light bulb." I later found out they were watching my hand-at-rest to see if the wrist-twisting motion of my hand in the air, "leaked through" to my hand at rest. It did. Slightly.  If it does, then i can stop worrying i have a traumatic brain injury from all the drunk cycling i did in my 20s. I'm pretty sure it does in some people. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ it happens!!!  Oh god, I can't imagine having my working memory be be any worse than it is now. That sounds awful it is called mirroring. 

I learned about this in the Handel institute.  Same! I'd rather just deal with the anxiety lol. Granted, mine isn't too bad. But I already forget thing so often as it is! Today I had to go back into the house 3 separate times before I finally left. Then I realized I forgot a charging cable for my phone because for some reason I brought them all in.
