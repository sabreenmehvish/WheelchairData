When you go to get tested for ADHD-PI and you demostrate you have ADHD before you even take the test. *I'll keep it short because walls of text suck... possibly maybe*

> So after panic-ing from losing my wallet and my friend complaining how unorganized I am I went to my school's health office to request getting tested for ADHD... They ask me for my school ID. But to my luck my wallet had my ID card with it. After telling them this the receptionist then tells me to go to the Disabled Student Programs and Services building to get the appointment and tells me the directions to get there... 

_

> and so I start focusing on the name of the building I am supposed to go to and start repeating it in my head... **"DSPS building... DSPS building...DSPS building...DSPS building..."** and like the forgetful lil' shit I am after walking for a couple minutes I forget the directions and have to go back and ask the receptionist lady the directions again. She just goes to escort me instead since the building is literally right next to the health office. *sigh*
Once there the other building's receptionist asks me for my school ID and I tell them that I don't have it... they then proceed to give me a lecture about how I should always have my student ID card with me and suggest that I should just keep a picture of my student ID on my phone. And as you'd except... I tell them I lost my phone a couple weeks ago. 

_

> So the receptionist lady #2 asks me "Why are you always losing things?" I reply... "Because ADHD... thats the thing I am here to get tested for."



I know this sounds waaay too stereotypical and cartoony... but its literally just what happened... Oh and while talking to the receptionists scatter around a bunch of "Uh what?" thus having them repeat their uh what they said due to me munching on these chewy mini sweet-tarts because they had a bunch of candy on the receptionist desks.

OKAY IM GOING TO GO FIND MY WALLET. I STILL HAVE HOMEWORK TO DO ALSO.

E: FOUND IT! :D   It was in the car seat burmuda triangle.

_


>**TL;DR** I go to my school's student health services to get tested for ADHD. I forget and already lost and lose everything essential to getting tested for ADHD... my struggles ensues.

 Losing things like that is stereotypical and cartoony...


Because it is so goddamn true. Just got my official report of the evaluation back in the mail from the psychiatrist. She actually put in the report that we had to delay the start of the testing because I somehow managed to lose my keys in the waiting room. I was in there for like five minutes. \*facepalm\* My favorite ADHD Dad thing is having a kid's right shoe in my hand so I can reference it while hunting for its match, finally finding the left shoe, and then not being able to find the right shoe that was literally just in my hand. I was late and stressed for my appointment because I got lost and have no spatial awareness and didn't think to arrive early enough to plan for this because I have no preplanning skills. Plus I was starving because I'd forgotten to eat or leave any time to get food on the way.

I also kept going off on tangents when she was asking me questions. I ended up asking anxiously at the end of appointment one what she thought and she laughed and said I'm not allowed to say but you're basically textbook, I'm fairly certain the next appointment will cement this impression.

Oh. Okay. Haha. When I was being tested for ADHD, the psychologist was going down a list of symptoms and asked if I experienced struggles with waiting for appointments and stuff. I kneejerk reaction said no I don't, and he just gave me a look and called me out on my answer because I had impulsive issues waiting for the very appointment that I was being tested in and he saw it before he called me into his office. I was just floored like "damn, that's right..." I once went to get a script filled, and lost it somewhere between my car and the pharmacy counter. I proceeded to dump out my entire bag on the counter, rifling through everything, then realized it might be in the car, so I LEFT MY BAG ON THE COUNTER (contents all asunder) and marched back to the car. The script was on the ground next to my car. 

I handed over the script (crumbled, like a couple weeks old) and when the pharmacist saw what it was for, he busted up laughing.  I was so proud of myself when I found a new psychiatrist recently. I wrote down the questions I needed to ask, paid with the right card, was “on time” (late, but not as late as she was lol). 


Afterwards on my way home, I realized I forgot to make a follow up appointment. Which was literally the last thing my psych told me to do -_- 


**So. Close.**


Took me another week to call them to schedule it lol.  I forgot to bring my health insurance when I came to visit my psychiatrist for the first time...sigh This is so typical and ironic. lol

I lost my sunglasses today. They were in my purse. Which is searched thoroughly! Twice.  :-/ I had a visit with a psychologist a little while ago. An ADHD specialist, mostly for school-aged children. My first session started well but by the end I got the feeling this man wasn't going to help me, that he judged me in that hour and decided I didn't have ADHD. "It's just your depression, it's just your anxiety, it's just your gender dysphoria." No, I have ADHD.

To prepare for next session (which happened to be my last with him, btw) I did the Vanderbilt assessment on my own. I knew that the results, though helpful, wouldn't mean much without a professional to interpret them. I just wanted something semi-concrete to show this jerk.

So anyway, the beginning of the assessment has the "Never" bubble on the left, the "Sometimes" bubble in the middle (duh) and the "Always" bubble on the right. I'm paraphrasing the words, the placement is what matters. I did those fantastically, followed the directions. In the bottom section, the How You Did In Subjects In School part, the bubbles were flipped. "Excellent" was on the left and "Terrible" was on the right.

Guess who didn't notice the directions on the ADHD test itself. Me. I did the entire botton section backwards. I only noticed after I finished the test and came back to read it a few hours later!

I've been there, OP. Best of luck getting diagnosed. :)

&nbsp;

*I scored 8/9 on Inattentive, 3/9 on Hyperactive, and a perfect 7/7 on Depression/Anxiety.*

*This week my GP gave me a trial of 10mg XR Adderall and holy shit is thinking so much easier. I'm calm and I can shift my focus. My social anxiety has gone way down, because now I'm not afraid I'll say something inappropriate or not pay attention to what the person I'm interacting with is saying.*

*I'm so thankful I made it here.* Lol it's not really funny but it is... my fiance has very severe ADD-PI that went undiagnosed until he was 23. He lost 2 jobs, couldn't function at all, took him probably a year to actually make the appointment and then another 3 months of missing and rescheduling... I finally had to call for him and drag his ass to the appointment where he showed up tired, disheveled, and couldn't pay attention to the evaluation form long enough to answer the questions about attention span haha. Doctor came in and sighed and said "well I think it's obvious you have ADD"  I remember when i was in elementary school and i was getting tested for add i was fine taking the test and doing everything the proctor asked me to and then after comleteing one of the questions i just kept going even though she told me i had to wait for her to do each one and right there she was like " i didnt tell you to continue" right there i was like oh shit, at the time i didnt know what they were testing me for but looking back i fell right into it I spent 5 minutes hunting for my keys today because even though they were hanging on the hook where I always hang them I just didn't see them there. I see an ADHD specialist, along with my wife and my oldest kid. When my wife showed up early for her appointment to get tested they thought didn't take her seriously until all of her test results were reviewed thoroughly.  My second introduction to my new neighbour involved saying hi on the way out the front door of our apartment complex and her telling me she was going to the bank. A couple of minutes later, I see her pull back into the parking lot and start sheepishly walking back to the front door. She then informed me that she forgot her wallet. I knew at that very moment that we were going to become good friends :) I haven't even read the post yet, but I'm listening to "Possibly Maybe" by Björk and and read the first sentence in time with the song. The first time I tried to get tested was right after high school I think, and they sent me home with this questionnaire that my mom was supposed to fill out, and then I needed to return it to my doctor. My mom found the questionnaire a few years later in some random bookshelf somewhere in the house. We've always joked that if she didn't already suspect that I had it at the time, that would've convinced her. It's stereotypical because we've all been there! You're taking steps to better your mental heath, good for you! Exclamation points! I was supposed to fill out some assessment paperwork and bring it back in with a bunch of old school records. I brought in half of the records she asked for and none of the paperwork. Because I forgot about the other half of the records and I filled out half the paperwork and then lost all of it. 

The doctor kind of stared for a second wondering if I was kidding, because it didnt even occur to me how enormously stereotypical that was until she pointed it out. "Nah, that's just how I've always been though" turned into "I have news about why you've always been like that."

And I was late for both appointments. On campus.  I go to a clinic that specializes in ADHD. I asked the receptionist how often people were late because I and my partner were you guessed it, late. 

"Oh, god, ALL of our patients are late!" Classic. My favourite too. Like when you forget and miss the deadline for signing up for exams with the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), and the OSD counselor is like, well there's nothing we can do you have to do it with your class...and literally, right outside her door there is a huge ADHD-friendly poster. Or when you had just finished your visit with the psychiatrist for ADHD diagnosis, but forget the medication prescription in the washroom, on your way out, so you cant take it until next time you get in to see him, in two weeks (because even though you went back it was cleaned up by the cleaning staff) so forgetfulness symptoms are still looming large. Or that one time when you are supposed to remember to take your ADHD medication every day BUT a) you forget, because ADHD, and B) wait, maybe you didn't forget, maybe you took it but you forgot that you did...but it is too risky to take another dose so you just have to wait and see if your brain collapses in the middle of the day, and only then for sure you will know that you didn't take it. 

I mean, what the hell. It's a LOOP. I feel you. Bless my nerd husband who has contributed some of the cleaverest help strategies: stickers with my name and return email address for EVERYTHING I own. 

Now all I need is one huge sticker on my forhead saying: "I have ADHD. If I look lost, call this number, return me to my husband." I showed up soaked 15 minutes late to my testing appointment because I forgot to check the forecast, took the wrong bus, and had to walk a mile to the psych's office from the nearest stop on pouring rain.

I also doodled a sailboat on the self-report questionnaire. I forget my prescription at the pharmacy at least once a month. Thankfully my psychiatrist sends texts emails and automated calls in the days leading up to each appointment and I force myself to show up early and anxiously chainsmoke until I can show up exactly ten minutes early. Had a very simular experience, I forgot the name of the adhd-specialist I was seeing and also didn't know my GP his name so they could later ask him for the reference I also forgot.  (-: Lol, I showed up to my specialist appointment the day before I was supposed to, even took the afternoon off work and drove an hour to get there. Made the diagnosis quite easy!  I manage my misplacement issues by relying on my habits. For example, I take a jacket with me wherever I go, and it serves as a purse. My phone has a wallet case, and it is always placed in a specific jacket pocket. I never let it leave that pocket unless it's charging and I never allow myself to leave a room without it and the jacket.

It's to the point now that I can intuitively sense that something isn't right if I leave a room and don't feel my jacket on me / don't feel the familiar bulge of my phone. It's kind of a built-in reminder. I lost my phone the other day in the house.  Or at least I thought I did.  I searched EVERYWHERE for the damn thing.  The garage, on the trash bins, in our cars, downstairs, upstairs, rooms I hadn't even fucking been in with it.  So my wife called it, and it starts ringing.  In my sons room.  The little fuckers had hid my phone under one of their pillows...

I was at the point of where I was almost crying because I forget where I put things ALL THE DAMN TIME, and I was cursing my ADHD for making me lose my phone.

I wanted to smother my kids with the fucking pillow I was so upset.  But I didn't, and they get to live another day. Did you find your wallet? Lol I forgot to go to my first appointment. Then the nurse asked why I was staring out the window most of the time. I lost my keys in my car tonight. I locked and figured I'll use someone else's in the morning to get in. There's many keys to my car door for this reason. There's only one key that starts it. It stays in a bowl in the center but we all have door keys... Which has led to me driving down the road wondering what the odd sound I hear is to realize I LEFT MY KEYS IN THE FREAKING DOOR!! I reach out my window and snatch them out of the lock and feel like a massive idiot. Even worse I was training someone for work! I swear, I think part of that initial eval is how we handle the appointment itself. When I had mine done they were 100% prepared for me being late, forgetting which day the appointment was on, not being able to sit through more than ~45 min at a time of testing, etc etc.  > I'll keep it short

Say so many here, before proving ourselves terrible liars. =D

As for losing shit, I'd recommend finding a system that works for you. For me, it took losing 1 phone and 1 wallet to end up strapping them to me permanently. Luckily I've never done worse with my keys than forget them at home, but if I ever did, I'd probably end up with them round my neck on a string.

But as it is, I always put them in the same place either on my person or at home, and I never ever ever ever put them anywhere else. Not even a different pocket. Don't fall for the comfort of it. "Oh, it's still on me, I'll be fine". No! The other pocket is another dimension to the planes of infinity. Don't fall for its whore lies. TL;DR - The building with the sweet tarts on the receptionist desk. When I went to get a prescription I had to run a mile to get cash to pay for the copay. I then almost left the water bottle I bought after getting cash back and desperately needed Bc, yk, running, on the receptionists table. Good times I tried to pick up my meds today from the apothecary but I lost my bank card (for the millionth time). At least the pharmacist probably didn't think I was faking it. I did the exact same thing... showed up at my doctor for ADHD assessment with no health card because I had just lost my wallet.  Ugh. [removed] It took me several rather expensive coats to break myself of the habit of leaving them on the bus. Even then, the solution was to put them in my backpack and never take them out. If I set it down on the seat next to me and it's not my backpack, it's basically lost already. Lost my ID at airport a week ago. I swear it was in my hand not 30 seconds before I lost it.  my worst one ever was my social security number written on a sheet of paper because SOMEONE at comcast thought that the best method to prevent stolen identity was to write the number, pass it to the employee, and then have the employee give the sheet with the number on it back to the person. yeaaahh.. hopefully i don’t get my identity stolen?  Had some really nice wallet ago. Fell outta my pocket at a restaurant and these jokers decided to rob it that freaking night. I was mildly upset in the morning when I found everything out. Username checks out Oh man, my favorite is when I get chided by people for having symptoms while they actively deny that I have any problems. "Why can't you just remember stuff?" "What is your problem?" When I have a stress-induced meltdown.  Yeah I had to reschedule because I was late. Lol. I twice did the counting kids check and freaked out about the newborn while holding her. In my defense, she was very tiny and thus didn’t really got heavy enough to remind me she was there for a few months! "Where are my glasses?!"

"I can't find my glasses because I don't have them on, you know how nearsighted I am!.. I hate it when this happens!"

"Dad... are you wearing contacts today?"

...

...

"Shut up."

(edit:  "shut up" in a super playful way, my daughter has dealt with me for 12 years,  she gets me) I've done that with mittens in winter, running around looking for one and losing the one I was already holding.  Have you ever done it where you're holding the one, looking for the other, then you look down and see the one you've been holding the whole time and get excited because you think you just found the one you've been looking for? I had no idea this was common. Signed up on Reddit today and learned I’m probably ADHD. Sigh...now what I’m really glad I brought a person with me to my appointment, because when I left with a prescription I said to my friend “why did he give me this, he didn’t even say I have ADHD?”
Friend replied (with a look on his face that said ‘wow you’re crazy’) “yes he did, he literally said the words ‘you have adhd’ right before he started talking about medication”
 If this isn't the most relatable shit. Too many times have I had the Panic Search for my script as I walk up to the counter. Urgh.  Bahahaha, I did this yesterday setting up the appointment for my psych. They're just like "well if you don't get it to us, it's gonna be out of pocket so make sure you do that." I tried carrying a nice messenger bag for a while...  I quickly learned the horrors of carrying a "purse".

If anyone needs a used tissue or one of several packs of gum or tic-tacs please ask.  If you need a pen, a check, sunglasses, my tablet, the book I was going to read on the bus... those are on the counter next to my watch...  Luckily I've trained all my life to double check that I have my wallet in my pocket, and my phone has become part of the ritual...  my watch USED to be part of the ritual but I quit wearing one in about 2008 for some reason and now I own a really nice one that never leaves my bedroom.

"Wallet, Keys, Phone.  Wallet Keys Phone. Wallet Keys Phone."  gets to the car...  "KEYS!" My mom recently bought a more expensive pair of sunglasses than she normally does, and she’s terrified of losing them. Which she does several times a day... I have had to help her look and they’re usually in the case or on her head lol I lost my phone when I was talking on it. :( It's really hard given how many things can manifest similar symptoms. Also they seem to bring each other on, if that makes sense. I forget something or mismanage my time, then I feel anxious about it, then I feel depressed about it, then those lead to poor self-care, which exacerbates my ADHD! I happen to be cis so I can only imagine how difficult navigating gender identity issues must be for people like us. (That's some really awkward phrasing but I hope you get what I mean.) Not seeing things is the worst! I don't understand how my eyes can see something but my brain will just ignore that information. Hello brain, one of your jobs is to interpret this visual data, thank you. I know how bad I am at being on time so I always plan to leave way earlier than I really need to, so sometimes I'm actually early. I'm still late ocasionally, but it's only 10 minutes instead of 30. Sometimes showing up early is just a sign of a copping mechanism, and not a sign that you have your shit together. see... I don't agree with their judgement. Sometimes my anxiety will "eclipse" my ADHD and I will be early, but only because I'm fucking terrified of being called out and put on the spot for being late. They don't know that I ran around frantic the entire morning to get there early, but boy do I. lol. I was half an hour early because I forgot what time the appointment was, so hoping that counts in my "favour".  Nope :( Not yet atlest. All of it is fact though... theres no exaggeration or change to make it cutesy or glamorous. Yeah, because constantly losing your bearings and your important items is *cute* It's good to not take life so seriously all the time. Yeah, ADHD royally sucks but that doesn't mean we can't make light of it and laugh at ourselves sometimes. We'd go totally nuts if we didn't. Well, it is a coping mechanism, laughing about this stuff. Otherwise I'm curled up in a ball and feeling bad for appearing incompetent all the time. But, do my ideas ever crush it. My husband follows around behind me collecting the random things I absentmindedly set down in weird places...my phone, my purse, the baby... I was delighted when putting chains on wallets became a thing, because that kept me from loosing my wallet on the bus. Carabiners save my jackets from the same fate. Also water bottles and mittens. I love clipping things to myself. Then I can't lose them!! And it keeps my hands free, which is important to me. I once left an entire bike on the bus. 

A bike. 

The thing I literally rode that day to get to work.  Just left it in the bike rack on the bus I had boarded to get home. 

And the doctors *still* wanted to treat me with antidepressants. 

This fucking disorder, man.  > Username checks out 

In more ways than one. It was supposed to be "WhatwasIlookingfor." If you look, I switched the was and I, and that L in looking is actually a capital I. I didn't even notice until I was trying to log in on my mobile and it wouldn't take my username.

Psychiatrist: "Are you prone to careless mistakes?"

Me: "Ummmmm.........no?" BUT I STIIIIIIIIILL HAVEN’T FOOOUUUUND WHAT I’M LOOKING FOOOOOOORRRRR "Why are you always late?" "Why can't you remember to turn the lights off?"

And my personal favorite: "You just have to DO it!" Oh, thank\-you! That's helpful! I did this with a child that could speak. I found the jacket and said out loud "Where did she go?" And a disembodied voice spoke in my ear "I'm right here daddy." I jumped and she laughed. Sorta. I've forgotten which one I had to begin with and had to figure out if I was done with my search or not. Step one: do you have health insurance?

Step two: if so, look up your health insurance policy.

Step three: find out if said insurance covers ADHD testing

Step four: if it does, find someone in your area who can test for ADHD and takes your insurance

Step five: schedule appointment

Step six: go to appointment Go to your GP and tell them that you think you might have ADHD. Not every area has ADHD testing and in my rural, small town GPs' are the only resource we have that is available.  Keep reading, you're not alone.

Go for diagnosis if you wish (it opens up doors such as medication and also generally understanding and forgiving yourself) It's not necessary immediately so it's OK to wait if you feel a fraud.

Watch Russell Barkley's talks on youtube. If you can't watch a 3 hour talk (lol) just play the audio while you do something else, like cleaning. You're behind on your cleaning, too, aren't you? So there you go, you get two things done at once ;) Omg I thought I was the only one that did that! Every day (that I can remember to do it) on my way out the door, I chant “wallet, phone, glasses, chapstick, keys, badge.”

Then invariably have to go back because even tho I’ve been repeating it for ten minutes, I’m so used to saying it that I kind of stop listening to myself. Yeah but having a purse means I never forget my wallet.

My husband, on the other hand, will be on the road before he realizes he forgot his wallet. lol Gotta do that pre\-work macarena dance before you leave the house. 

Little did we know preschool was preparing us for some much of our future.  And that’s why I buy mine at Target (three pair at a time because I’m gonna lose them or scratch them). That is pitiful. lol Pricey, but check out Tile (little Bluetooth tags that let you ring them from your phone).  I have one for my bag, my keys, my wallet (they make a slim one), everything.  I have no idea what I'd do without them lol.  Plus you can ring your phone if you lose that too by double-tapping the button on the Tile tag.  Batteries last a year, so you only have to worry about replacing the tags once a year.  Literally a minor miracle if you lose crap all the time like I do lol. Good luck dude! [removed] Half the time I can't remember what I'm looking for, so I'm never sure if I've found it! 

Edit: Dammit. Now that song is stuck in my head, so thanks for that. ;\) Thank you for the steps, it makes it looks much less overwhelming. Also thank you for replying and yes, I do have health insurance through my husband, I’m due for a physical anyway. Something about going to the doctor to have them diagnose me, makes me think. If I do, then what? Is it even worth it you think? Or do I assume and move On to what I need to do to function? Yup, cleaning is most definitely behind! Lol
I’ll check the talks out, thanks a lot! I work from home for the most part now...which is really bad for when I DO have to go into the office because without my badge I have to go to the security desk and get "the badge of shame" temporary bright green pass and pin it to my clothes.  I think the doorman has one reserved for me.

The only time I use the front door by the security desk is when I forget my badge; so he always has the funniest reaction to seeing me walking in. I come by it honestly.  Mom lost me when I was a baby...while she was holding me. I'll back up the Tile things. I have one on my keys, one in my wallet, one with my rail card wallet, one on a hand-sewn plush 10th Doctor (I left him in a cafe once and dropped him in a ditch so he gets tagged), and my passport. Totally worth the price. I must say they actually last over the year but the app will continue to nag you to replace them. (obviously you know that but the person before wouldn't... although in hindsight it means that was a better place to post this) Its different ways to cope.  Then get out of the sub, look away, or keep your mouth shut. This is where people discuss ADHD, not discuss whether or not YOU think it’s legitimate.  Just add it to the jukebox;  try not to grind or tap your teeth to the beat of the music. Really bad for them I understand and had the same thought process. Only you can make that decision but for me, I am very happy I went and was diagnosed at age 39. I also decided to try medication. I thought of it like this - if you had diabetes, wouldn't it be better to know? ADHD is a medical condition (regardless of societal judgment), and should be treated as such. I laugh now at my ADHD moments instead of beating myself up. I understand my behavior better than before and have better perspective about what I can and can not do. Please feel free to DM if you have questions or need to vent.   
 Bahahaha! *narrows eyes, looks around for cameras* That makes so much sense when you say it like that. If I had any other condition, I’d be all over it! As much as I am all for people getting the help they need somehow I never apply it to myself. Thank you for reaching out, I didn’t expect any response to my comment and now I’m so glad I came back and checked this. I really appreciate it!
