It's easy to forget the good stuff! List your accomplishments However small or trivial it may appear to you or others, remind yourself of the good things you've done here.

Don't compare with others: no happiness comes from that, and you don't know the situation others face (and vice versa).  I had sex once! Im an IT guy for a startup. People rely on my heavily. I setup meetings and stuff, and always worry how they'll go when I'm not there. ADHD=forget so much shit. And I did. But a huge remote meeting went 95% flawlessly and I'm pretty happy. So that's an accomplishment for me.  I survived my Summer Internship! I did a lot of travelling alone when I was in my early 20s. 

I've started 3 small businesses to give me some spending cash when money was tight when my kids were little. They all met my needs, and people tell me its a big accomplishment but I don't think so.

I studied human lactation and moved to a country with dismal breastfeeding rates and quickly became a well known advocate and was on the national board of a committee. God forbid I would actually have stuck with it though.  Got excellent GCSEs and A Levels despite challenges.

Moved to a new city and became financially independent from my parents at 18.

Got a job completely on my own merits straight out of high school with a higher salary than average university graduates. 

Feels odd to toot my own horn but I guess I have achieved a few good things despite my ADHD’s best efforts!  I'm a dog trainer rescuing an extremely fearful border collie mix with a bite history. I am his last home whether he lives a good long life (he is only 8 months old) or bites again sadly meaning he won't have that chance, depending on the context and severity. I've been getting to know him for a week now. Today is the first full day he is in the home as I brought him here last night. So far so scared. Breaks my heart. Stressed, my resident dog is also stressed, my cat is hiding in the other half of the house, but doing my best to hold it together for all in a calm controlled manner. I have hope. I started my own small YouTube channel! Undergrad took 7 years due to taking a year off and being part time for 2 years. But finally finished, and went on to obtain my Masters of Science in healthcare IT ahead of schedule. Moral of the story: don’t let your tough times dissuade you. You are capable of more than you know.  Past 2 weeks I've been 💯 prepared the night before for meetings with big bosses at work! It's been awesome! One more week left of summer course! Might just  survive yet! One MAJOR accomplishment is taking up running. I’ve never been active due to severe asthma. I’ve been seeing a respirologist and my meds have increased my quality of life. She said I can go ahead and start some cardio, just be gentle and listen to my body. No problem when you have anxiety!
I started the couch 2 5K and stuck with it. And I was able to run (slowly) 30m straight by the end!!!! When I tell you I’ve never run in my life I mean it. No sports, nuthin.
I was floored at the effect it had on my anxiety and ADHD symptoms. The ‘runners high’ I feel reminded my of the adrenaline rush I got from doing not too smart things in the past, only this was healthy. So exciting. In fact, I just came back from a jog now. I suck compared to what I was but it gave me the confidence to just do it. I am an incredible reader. When I find a book I like I go through it with super speed.


I am also very interested in languages and people and human behavior, probably because it's something who has helped me a lot. People are weird and unpredictable, so I'll learn all I can. 



Super sensitive smell and taste, so I am AMAZING at tasting wine. In a very non-snob way, since I don't care about brands or such.




I have a dog. Not very trained. Can't walk on a leash. Gets very excitable. But I had two goals with him. Be friendly with everyone (dogs, people, kids) and I don't want him to beg for food. 
For NINE YEARS I have never fed my dog by the table or my plate and I won't allow anyone else either.

The only thing he begs for is attention. And he's really cute!  Two of my poems were published in an online journal! I’m very bad at finishing and submitting poems, so this was pretty exciting. I got into grad school and am 5+ years into a loving relationship! I think past me would be proud of who I am today I took a nap like, a week ago. I went vegan! A hyperfocus that I stuck with! I actual got some stuff done early for the remodel we are having done on our house! I am going crazy with nothing where it usually is (I am not anywhere near perfect about putting things away but usually SOME of it is put away so I can find it), but I am pretty proud of not having waited until the last second! I hope it was worth it, you heathen!  Good work!  Wow, enterprising! Could you explain a bit more about the three businesses? Part of my hope is that these comments inspire others with adhd, and show that we can get shit done, despite it.  I think we are often hyper critical, so tooting your own horn on the Internet is no problem.

Great work btw - when I taught I would tell kids to stay in school because there's bugger all jobs out there, glad you managed to get one when you finished! What type of work is it?  He's young, I'm sure you'll get there. I hope you do. It's horrible what people do to animals.  They all started small :) what is it and what does it cover?  No way! My undergrad was exactly the same. It definitely made me more resilient in the face of adversary.

You're so right: the only schedule you should be worrying about is your own, too often I compared where I was to others and it never helped!  Wow, great work! Hope you've been impressing them 😁 You'll get there! Good luck  How do you not lose interest in the book? Man u wish I was an incredible reader, that's awesome.  Wow, that's great news! If you want to share them be my guest!  Lmfao Sure! 
So I have a degree in fashion design. When I had my first kid I was broke and really wanted a baby carrier, so I made one. All my friends wanted one so I made more and it developed into a wee business :) it was ALOT of work and the profit vs time investment wasn’t worth it in the end when demand became more than I could handle. My adhd brain couldn’t organize what I needed to do to keep growing. Had another baby and called it quits.
Second one was a children’s clothing company that I started with a friend. It wasn’t as profitable as my third one so I bowed out to focus on that.
Third was is an online vintage clothing store. I LOVE IT. I love the thrill of the hunt of thrift shopping, I get ridiculously excited over garments I find. I photograph them and put them online for sale. I was doing really well a couple of years ago but had (yet another) child and there was some drama associated so it took the focus off. I still have it and I still love it!
 And possibly because of ADHD. There’s a certain determination that comes with hyperfocusing in on something that I don’t think neurotypicals get. Like a dog with a bone! Thanks! I’m a special needs nanny. That’s true - I was very lucky with the position I found! Currently also studying online to get my degree although it’s slow going... The name is “Old Bit Waves”.  It’s just a small thing about visualizing 8-bit and 16-bit game music as waves.

Unless you’re really nerdy about that kind of thing, I couldn’t really recommend it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  Thank you! I think it's been going good, I really want to brag about it but doing well at the meetings has been a big confidence booster. Thanks! I read interesting books! And I very often re-read my favourites. And another thing I love doing is re-reading books in English that I've previously read in Swedish (my first language). 


I also like reading "classics" that are not so fun but it's fun to see what the fuzz is all about. Very good to do when you can't sleep. I always try to read a few pages before I turn of the lights, it also helps my brain to unwind.  >Had another baby and called it quits.

Each to their own and all that, but why would you call your baby Quits?!

^s

But seriously, thanks for the info. Intrigued as to your design, you have any pics? Sounds good anyway, nice work!  What platform did you use for your online shop? I've always wanted to start one but I don't trust my ADHD brain to gets things shipped on time. And also it seems like to be successful these days with online shops you have to maintain a social media page and I'm not into that Yeah, I love that aspect.  Yeah, it's tough for us. But you'll get there, keep at it.  🤣🤣
Of the baby carrier? I’d have to dig one up! I’ll get back to ya! Etsy! Just upload photos and details :)
I sometimes suck with shipping. It’s tough - I keep a note by my computer that says ‘JUST SHIP ITS NOT HARD!’
