Is it normal to lose my train of thought when on Adderall ? I started Adderall (IR 10mg twice a day) today for my ADHD. So far it has been great for focus and i've experienced very little side effects or even feelings of euphoria/motivation. It's just easy for me to do things, i get less distracted, don't play the "5 more minutes"game and the music is my head is gone (although i kind of miss this). 

all in all... quiet... 

but my thoughts feel a little slower. I lost my train of thought a few times today and i'm forced to really think things through one by one or i forget. Is this normal? 

When speaking to people I am completely focused on what they're saying at that moment and can't predict what they're about to say next as much I typically do. It's throwing me off socially. 

Thanks! Extremely common and probably unavoidable. A big part of how adderall works (on a cognitive-architecture level) is by inhibiting the brain's Default Mode Network, which is active while daydreaming or mind-wandering. In neurotypicals, the brain's Task Priority Network can inhibit the DMN when they need to focus, but this inhibitory effect is weaker in ADHDers. Adderall inhibits the DMN and lets your TPN take control, so you can focus better on most goal-oriented tasks. But adderall is a brute-force solution, and the TPN-DMN interplay is much more complex and intricate than simple inhibition. In particular, you really need the DMN for things like prioritizing, planning, task switching, etc.  Interesting. Thank you for breaking that down for me. I tried searching for a similar question but couldnâ€™t find much.
