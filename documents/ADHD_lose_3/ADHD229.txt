How do you cope with memory loss... I've done so much over my life....at least I know I have. Meaning I've done many things that require focus and skill and have mildly succeeded in the past. I am super pissed-off that I forget things so easily.

Take the following scenario:

I used to produce music - a lot. I have lots of samples and productions out there somewehre. Recently I "updated" all of the music software and such I used to use - and now I don't know what the fuck I'm doing whatsoever and it's extremely frustrating. 
Granted I learned from experimentation - but why can't I remember any of this? Of course I remember the name of the program I use and such - but why nothing else.

Video games, machines, programs, technology - everything. If I don't CONSTANTLY use it and put it down for more than a week - it's gone. I have to relearn all over again - when I know I used to be somewhat proficient at it.

Can anyone else sympathise? Does medication help you? How do you "come back" to things? 

The biggest drawback is being "trained" on things at work, and then thrown back into the spot I was "trained" on a couple weeks later and I have no idea what in the hell I'm doing. The hyper-focus we have makes us _seem_ like we learn quickly, but damn...it's so frustrating.
 I'm good at remembering how to do things. But I think ptsd and spacial remembrance may help with that.

The one I always forget is people. I will forget someone's name literally 2 minutes after they introduce themselves. And then if I don't see them for a couple weeks? It's like meeting a brand new person. Which is kind of highly offensive to people and extremely embarrassing.  I get yelled at a lot. Wife thinks I don't listen & I try bloody hard to,but I know how she feels & I feel bad. I try to write things down, then I forget where I put it. She gets upset because I can remember some things I'm really into & hold down a technical job. Wish I had the answers, but I don't. Seriously how great is music production tho, right? The rest of the world just kinda goes away huh. What's your preferred platform?  For me it's dates and words and people. I forget what I did 10 mins ago, this morning, yesterday, last week, last month, last year.
I sort of feel like I live without a past but I try to take lots of pictures and archive them to remember. I write lots of notes and reminders. This hits home so much. I mostly notice my short term memory being terrible now, I always forget what I just did or what I’m doing while I’m doing it. I work using a computer all day and I keep a piece of paper right below the keyboard where I write what I’m working on because otherwise I’ll spend a bunch of extra time trying to remember. But my long term memory has always been bad too, my friends who’ve known me for a long time can attest to that. I actually noticed it again a couple nights ago when I was having a conversation with someone about movies and shows we’ve seen, and when talking about ones that I KNOW I’ve watched, they would bring up scenes in characters I don’t remember at all! I don’t understand. I hate it so much.  Sometimes I forget what I’m talking about right after my words leave my mouth. That happen to anyone? I also struggle with. It's one of my biggest barriers at work. If I learn a task that doesnt need to be performed on a regular basis I forget how to do it.   


I'm learning that coping mechanisms for ADHD means making changes in your Environment. Medication helps you to make changes in your environment but it wont help you magically remember how to do things when time has elapsed.  Or maybe I'm just not on the right dose/medication yet xD  


I am working on creating "cheat sheets" to help me remember. For every task that requires multiple steps and is not done on a regular basis, I am writing down all of the steps when I learn them. I use images as well or icons to help me. Then I can refer back to my cheat sheet.  yeah, when mixed with multiple concussions, the memory loss is crazy. half the time i don't even know what i'm doing when i'm doing it. its like being in a state of mental paralysis.  My experience with ADHD is that I have a hard time remembering things that I'm not currently obsessing over, paying lots of attention too. What I've found though is when I return to that subject the memories come flooding back extremely quickly, it just takes longer to get your brain in gear. Same way. Before diagnosis I always said that I had to constantly relearn things. Probably why tackling new programming languages is a breeze for me - after having to relearn everything all the time. I had a great strategy for this issue but I don’t remember what it is. I can empathize. I cope by keeping notes in an app on my phone. I have two phones, so if Im at work I’ll use the memo app on my android work phone, and if I’m anywhere else, I’ll use the notes app on my personal iPhone. The nice thing with both apps is that they allow for multiple “notebooks”, and to freely write within each one.

With the Memo app, if there is something specific I need to remember at work (this person is the one to contact about this thing I’m in charge of, that thing needs replacing every 3 weeks, this is the step by step of how to check that this thing is still functioning correctly) I put it in the app with an appropriate title. That way when my memory fails me (as it does all the damn time) I can take out my phone and look it up. 

With the Notes app, I can share an individual note with someone if I want, so if there is something that I want both myself and my husband to remember and have access to (our specialized ramen order from our favorite place maybe, or what we’ve bought for Christmas presents for the kids in our lives, or what medication dosage the cat needs), I’ll add him to it. It works really well, and I use this multiple times a day. 

It’s not a perfect system, and it requires that I constantly have a phone by my side, but I’ve managed to find a system that works for me. Hopefully you find something that works for you too!  Tl;dr: I relate and sympathize. Fuck that aspect of ADHD with a blistering hot spade.

Aaargh. OP, you've just hit the most painful part of ADHD for me personally. 

I can put in the effort. I can learn. I can reach heights.
And what's the point if I lose it all anyway?

Some tiny little bits and pieces remain and feed into my general framework of knowledge, but I can see how those are breadcrumbs from the general stuff I've learned over the years and have forgotten. When in a better mood, I quip that I've forgotten more than most people have ever learned. But when somewhere like today, when I'm going over the first chapters of a textbook that I can't freaking remember even though these are the most basic of basics in something... Yeah. It feels like you're constantly standing still. Or running on a mountain of sand.  Dude, took 34 years to learn to do RUbix cube, then got it down to 2 mins to solve.  Then stopped for 1 whole month and could no longer solve independently.  Had to look at a guide.  So much hot face that night and frustration.  I feel you.  It comes back much faster.  That's how we recover.  Plus our ADHD makes us willing to try stuff if its in our visual field, so put it where you will see it if you want to regularly use it.   you just described me.

 Are you me? During high school I used to put so much effort into music production and writing my own music, have recordings and everything from back then. I still have all my programs, but I cant for the life of me do it anymore. It's the same with guitar, I put my guitar down for a break or just losing interest for the time being and when I go to pick it back up, nope gotta reteach myself. I hate it because I love music so much. Currently trying to relearn guitar though! I totally feel you, pal. I hate always forgetting things whether it be some small thing or something really important. I tend to get really frustrated by it and want to jump bash my head I to the wall. I’m untreated and have some other disorders that impair memory, not to mention bad memory runs in my family.

I just endure it for as long as I can.

My memory issues is probably why I come off to as “not trying hard enough” to some people. When I was in school, I studied for the graduation test. I studied in class, at home, the night before. Yet, I would forget everything and ended up failing (I later passed after like four attempts)

Or when people say “that’s an excuse” or “you remember you’re just lying.” Some people really don’t believe someone’s memory could be that bad :/

I have short term and long term memory problems, I also suffer a tad bit of derealization/depersonalization, which makes things even harder because I can’t determine if my memories are real or not.
 I relate quite a bit to this, especially because my anxiety ends up leading to a stupid amount of compartmentalization where I’ll end up shoving a bunch of important info out of my mind to avoid panicky thoughts. Here’s my couple tips, they work for me so hopefully they help:

1. Notes. As other have mentioned, this is how I survive work and school. Find something that you can always have with you - a small notebook if you wanna try bullet journal type stuff, your phone, laptop, whatever (we use slack at work and I’ll send myself messages, Trello is a good one to be able to organize stuff nicely, OneNote is good if you want to draw or hand write stuff). Then whenever someone tells you some fact or way to do something, write it down immediately. 

Nobody gives a shit, it shows you’re paying attention and making an effort, and even if you _never_ remember to reference it, when you come back to the task or whatever you’ll have a tangible action that helped strengthen the memory by including not just mental but physical reinforcement. At my work this helped especially when I had to help train a new person because I could basically just send them half my notes as I went and then they also had something to reference. 

2. Lessen expectations. When it comes to video games and hobbies, I’ve just accepted that I will never enjoy super involved or difficult games for those exact reasons - I have to look over the controls and mess around a bit before I catch my stride again. Obviously play/do whatever you want but if you know you’re going to forget the controls it gives you the option of just rolling with it, accept that every game is a bit more of a puzzle for you or make yourself a cheat sheet for the ones you struggle to remember the most. Games are only meant to be fun so let yourself have fun and just know your fun is a bit more chaotic than others.

3. Practice consciously remembering. You know the things you struggle to remember, because it’s what will drive you crazy all day every day. For me a big one is whether or not I locked my car. Whenever you do something you need to remember, find a way to stop and take a second to feel like you’re consciously solidifying it in your mind. For me sometimes it’s as simple as picturing the fact/action/moment and imagining putting it in a box or surrounding it with concrete in my mind. I’ll do that in work meetings if I need to remember a task someone asked me to do until I can write it down after the meeting is over. 

Sometimes though it requires an additional physical step - similar to writing it down, when I lock my car I always lock it twice so the horn honks. Then I can stop and think to myself “yes I heard the car horn” and as I walk away and start to forget whether or not I pressed the lock button on my keys, I have the whole moment of hearing and acknowledging the horn to reassure me. 

4. Be present in a moment, as best you can. Something I’ve learned lately is how much a brief mental pause can help you stay grounded. If you’re in a meeting/class and feel like you’re drifting away - just ignore everything for a second, take a few deep breaths and count the beats in and out. The counting kind of distracts you from the distraction and brings you back to the present moment. 

This isn’t only true in work/school - I’ll do this while on vacation with my family, to better remember a beautiful bit of architecture before taking a picture, in conversation with my boyfriend so I can really be present with him, on a drive somewhere so I won’t worry so much about being late, etc. Anything you’re doing it’s easy to get lost. Stop, remind yourself where you are and what you’re doing and even if you’re distracted a second later at least you’re calm. 

5. Yes medication helps. It’s ridiculously strange to me how different but simple it feels to just have your mind in order all of a sudden. Often it means I still have to do all these things to remember stuff, but medication helps me remember _to_ do these things. Weird cycle but it works. 

Anyways, everyone is different and you’ll learn what works best in yourself as you try different things. The best tip I’ve been given recently - just try one thing at a time in manageable chunks. Whether it’s something you’re trying to do every day or keep on your mind throughout other tasks, just take it one thing at a time. Maybe every couple weeks or every month you pick a new thing but it helps with any change in your life, especially ones for self care - you can’t reduce stress by stressing yourself out with everything you have to fix!  Poorly  Yeah, totally. It's strange, I usually remember everything about computers and programming because that's my vocation, but I'll forget everything else, like moments I've spent with friends and family. Makes me sad. 

Also it's harder for me to do things because i find more difficult to 'access' the info in my brain to do things, if that makes sense. I usually don't know what to do in a lot of situations (specially socially) because of that, I think I don’t remember. Yup, can totally sympathize with the use it or lose it. Ritalin helps and being aware of this weakness makes me try harder to remember, like repeating things when people say it and asking questions about how things work so the steps are more intuitive. 

Really sucks though.  If you want to remember something efficiently you have to test yourself about it instead of reading it again and again. It seems to be working with me for courses for instance How good's your memory? Can't remember, eh? Then why not try...these, erm...things..... Yes. This is one of my biggest problems. I tell the same story over and over again. I forget procedural things. Details - just no. It is so frustrating I want to scream The way you describe the way in which you learn things makes a improvised impression on me. That would have been fine if you were able to reproduce the results that you were getting. 

Having a system worked for me.

Get a notebook (moleskine maybe) i have one for work related things and write in it. Write down the specific steps to make in order to get a result. You might even go as far as applying memory techniques or creating a mind-map about a piece of software (or how to operate a certain machine) that you use in order to systematically remember the steps to get a result. 

Memory techniques man, changed my life. 
I always had to put in a lot of effort to remember things, which was frustrating for me. Untill i actually got taught on how to remember things.. Did the thought that they don't teach you how to remember things at school ever occur to you? They train you like a circus animal, make you jump though all kinds of hoops but they somehow forget to educate you on how to remember things.

Here are some links, i hope they are helpfull to you.

If you get the chance then participate in a Tony Buzan course, what they teach for that money is pure gold.







 Very much relate to this.

I feel like I should have my degree revoked because it certainly isn't indicative of what I know anymore. And I feel like that happened within a year of graduating. Not that it's all gone but I feel like someone could read the Wikipedia page and know more.

  


  


Sucks in work situations like you described to. If you can, keep every question you ask and every detail of instruction. Sometimes things make sense when you first learn them so it feels like you'll remember it, but if you're like me, there's a good chance you won't, and then you'll be glad you took notes. And yeah, I worry about looking dumb for writing simple things seen but it's honestly worth it. Sometimes there isn't time to reference your notes though, in which case. Idk! (Btw, i don't mean to be patronizing if you already do something like this, I just err on the side of giving advice on the off chance it's helpful lol)

  


  
 Memory. I mourn the loss. As many have said: I forget what just came out of my mouth. And I can def relate to the comments about the Syndrome of “use it or lose it”. I try my best to learn a new routine in my work life. And I usually master what I tackle. But if ai don’t USE it... I always lose it. And usually in a matter of days. It’s very disheartening to be like this. 
I was always considered to be bright, sharp, and quick to grasp concepts. As a teen, my IQ was 139. Not genius, but darn close! And now? Sometimes I wonder what happened to me. Did I finally burn completely out? Is this early onset dementia? Am I’m a victim of having spent 25 years on stimulant medication? Or, is it just one of the typical things that happens with the aging process. (I’m 68 now).  I am bad with both faces and names. It's tough sometimes. Same here...I had this one friend in college, for months the only time I ever saw him was while I was already drunk at parties - I ran into him pretty much every time I went out.  I remember all the interesting details about him, but I could not hold onto his name for the life of me.  He was pretty good natured about it, he'd give me grief and then we'd go back to our legendary beer pong pairing.

The problem was I still couldn't remember his name after more than 6 months...he eventually started taking it personally.  I think I had some kind of mental block...but it broke up the team.  My game has never been the same. > The one I always forget is people. I will forget someone's name literally 2 minutes after they introduce themselves. 

Word. Luckily my wife is beginning to understand that I don't mean to forget - and that I appreciate all that I do regardless of the date.

As far as technical job goes though, do you feel like your knowhow is best while you're AT WORK as opposed to home? I remember medication names and things that I couldn't begin to talk about outside of work while I'm actually on-the-clock.

As far as music - I use FL Studio and Native Instruments. > She gets upset because I can remember some things I'm really into & hold down a technical job.

(Hunger Games salute)

Are you using phone reminder apps? They've turned things around for me. don't watch the movie memento

bit of sarcasm from me. sorry bro

i feel ya I had an issue a few days ago when I would literally stop for a period of time and forget what I was doing, then suddenly remember. This comes in bursts. I don't experience it every day but when I do my whole day is stressful. It'll happen every few minutes. And then when someone tries to follow up with a question and you can't tell if the question is relevant to what you were saying because you can't remember what you were saying. Yup, that sounds familiar. I have the horriblest (not a word) problem, as soon as I get distracted it’s like someone in my brain pressed “delete all” and I just don’t remember anything about what I was going to do or say. It’s frustrating. Mid thought, end of thought, can’t remember shit about what came out of my mouth .02 seconds ago.  Blank brain.  Frustrating. My family refers to that as a "cow flew by" moment. I have those cheat sheets too! They work wonders. It's pretty embarrassing to have someone tell you, "I told you how to do x already" > If I learn a task that doesnt need to be performed on a regular basis I forget how to do it.

For me I tend to make user manuals / guides on how to do stupid tasks because of how this was affecting me. I give the excuse that "We're gonna need some accountability in case of a new staff" to make them, when in actual fact I use it for a refresher if I need to do something (like key in some item into our inventory, which I do probably once every 2-3 months) concussions?

i had 2 severe ones during my childhood. really really severe.

can you link concussions to memory loss etc? 

if so source? 


appreciated my friend
 I smashed to the back of my head a couple times trying to learn to wheelie. Didn't help much That I can relate to with video games. 

"Oh cooooool!" _get good at it_

"Hang on. I forget how to play" _four days later_ I would LOVE to learn code (and I did kind of with RPG Makers Python variable if-then system) but it goes away so quickly Yep! Funny that I have a Rubix come lying around Not OP here, but I’ve definitely tried to keep a journal of sorts and because of my love for writing I never am able to write things down to help me remember, Instead I tend to write stories or ideas for them and I end up forgetting what I was doing in the first place. My coping skill for people long before I was diagnosed was nicknames. I'd take that one random detail my brain decided to retain and build a name around it. Most people felt cool and special for it. Some hated it. Once I was medicated, I started doing association games from the nickname to their actual name so I could remember it in real time professional settings. My job can involve interaction with 100+ people per day, all of whom view me as the face of the organization, and all of whom need to feel independently valued. No one would know it's the hardest part of the job for me, but the actual mechanics of my work are a breeze compared to remembering that super volunteer I depend on for this project is one of five Marthas I met today.  Ugh this happened to me recently!  
  
So years and years ago I used to know a guy called Curtis. He has a big afro and is really dorky / nerdy, and I only ever saw him on nights out in Manchester.  
  
Then a few years after that I met a guy called Garrick. He also has a big afro, is really dorky / nerdy, and I only ever saw him on nights out in Sheffield.  
  
I bumped into Curtis recently and I could NOT think of any name other than 'Garrick'. Then he was offended I couldn't remember his name, so I was like 'Oh no you look just like this other friend I have!' - except they don't look the same at all apart from their skin colour and hair so then he was like wtf no I don't.  
  
Oh god, it was so embarrassing and I felt like such a moron. The thing is, I definitely do remember his name, I just got the stupid name block thing that happens sometimes. Nice.same as me! Can't even remember life before Massive & the NI kits. I work with computers & electrical stuff that requires a lot of formulas & whatnot. I retain numbers pretty well I guess. I'm part of the machine when it's work, but tell me peripheral information that doesn't affect me right now & it's gone. The worst thing is I know I'm fucking up but I struggle to fix it. I don't blame her for not understanding, I just need to get better at being a regular husband that doesn't leave coffees all over the house & completes tasks Saw a thread on here about habitica so tried that, but unless it's a thing needing to be done directly in front of me or a core thing like breathing for example,i can't even. Honestly I have no idea where people find time for facebook n such. Also I'd most probably need some friends to use facebook proficiently,so there's that as well  Yeah the struggle is real :( at least we know we’re not alone.  I'm learning to say "I have trouble with my working memory, so I need to write this down" XD

I say something similar  when I meet people for the first time, or even people I've met before but can't remember their names 

 "I have trouble with my working memory and have a hard time recalling names. So please tell me your name everytime you see me, until I say your name first!" I say that line with a bit of humour and the responses are usually them jokingly popping up and sharing their name. Which works! After a few of those jokes, I remember there name.

We can't rely on our own brain to remember, so we need external reminders 😊 Yup! It's frustrating how we can't remember these simple tasks. Making a user manual is a perfect idea :) 

My issue is I tend to over complicate tasks. Or when I write it out, I miss somethibg important like what do with special cases or something...

Getting there, but getting there slowly XD  my case is more rare than most as i have been concussed quite a few times, at least 8. i grew up engaging in violence a lot. 

after looking online for a bit, [this one](https://www.brainline.org/article/memory-and-brain-injury) seems to boil the points down quite well.

in particular, the part about what can make the problems worse is interesting. it seems ADHD has many of those effects as symptoms. which would make memory problems even worse for those with ADHD. stress, strong emotion and lack of sleep is basically my normal state. i am totally umedicated and have never even told other people in my life how bad it is because i feel they wont believe me. when i have episodes of memory loss, others seem see it as a funny quirk and just say everyone forgets sometimes. these episodes can be extremely stressful and panic inducing and it is likely the only reason i can have them and still be sane is because i grew used to facing fear when i was young and can handle a lot of it.

it seems the brain will heal over time, but i am sure repeated blows to the head will cause permanent damage. the severity of the blow also matters a lot. there is a lot of room for variables.  Hah. Maybe one day we can make a track called "What?" I use the default iPhone reminders app, and I've developed a habit that if something has to happen in the future I enter it into my phone **right now** (as you know, for us there is no "in five minutes"). My phone is always beeping to tell me what to do next, and my wife is happier. Well, closer to happy. I try not to vocalize my adhd symptoms at work so I don't appear as a liability.  thanks Haha! Count me in mate! Be warned though,production may Sporadicly halt from time to time for important things like light hitting the window a certain way or a particularly interesting insect or my personal favorite:"OH FFS, WHERE THE FUCK DID I LEAVE MY TRACKBALL?!? " Thanks for the advice! Will definitely try & institute what you said. Tryn to get me some of that "happy wife=happy life" action too bruh I'm lucky to work in environments that are supportive :)

 I also find how you word things makes a difference. By stating a single impairment like "I have poor working meory" rather than saying "because of ADHD" people are more receptive. Even just saying "if I don't write it down I'll forget!" Most people can relate to that sentiment, it just might not be as essential to them as for you. 

 Everyone struggles with one thing or another, and I have found people are genuinely open to being accommodating when you open up about it. Especially when you are not using it as an excuse but rather explaining why your doing things a certain way or how you can perform better if a few things were changed. 

I've had bad experiences with opening up as well, so it really depends on the people and the environment your in. 

Hopefully you can work towards working in an envelope that is supportive :) but understandably that's not always easy.
