My head is so clear I could cry! *Just started medication* Hoooooly shit! I just started my treatment of biphentin. The psychiatrist started me out on 20mg for the first week - I was disappointed to find that it stimulated me and did not really alleviate my ADHD symptoms. Today I started my 30mg treatment and holy fuck.. is this what I've been missing out on my entire life? 

I am so elated I could cry. I called my mom absolutely ecstatic and she started balling her eyes out. I'm so thrilled, she blamed herself so much for all of this and to find something that is actually working is a great relief for my family. 

TL;DR - meds finally started to work, I can finally sit down and do things. My head is clear, my life is about to change.  I remember this moment too, after 50 years wondering what the hell is wrong with me?? Then once I started taking my medication I was confused because I had never experienced this clarity before. 

Welcome to the first day of your new life!  Welcome to the "real" world :) At times I like my ADHD personality, but usually I like being the true myself without having a shouting monkey in my head. I hate to be the guy to say this, but are you sure you're not just experiencing a "high" from the meds? Perfectly normal if you are, but that feeling usually doesn't last after you've been taking the meds for a while. Let us know if the meds continue to help after a few months. I feel you! I was almost pissed because i spent all this time without them! I know exactly how you feel right now! Just started medication this week and my I can't believe I can finally start being the person I knew I could be. Im excited to start some new chapters in my life with all of the productivity I have going on now. 

Congratulations on getting medicated! Thanks everyone for the pump up! For those who's medication hasn't really kicked in yet, have trust in the program your physicians, psychologist and psychiatrist set for you. I'm fortunate to have 3 doctors who work very closely with one another to help me get a new start on life.  I am still waiting for this moment to happen. Started at 10mg of Adderall XR and now at 25mg and still nothing at all. One day! I try to tell people that like I actually feel like a person. And people are like haha yeah me too, some days. And I'm like no, you don't understand, when I take my medication it's like, I can function, and I've never felt like I could function before. But people just don't understand how it feels.  As silly as it sounds welcome to clarity and all the good that cokes with it :)  I cried my first day I started medication. I asked my co-workers "is this how you always feel?" I cant explain to you the amount of happiness and emotion that welled inside me when I felt the "fog" clear for the first time in my life.  I love hearing this. I hope to be there soon. Waiting waiting waitingâ€¦ and getting impatient. Can't wait for this moment. Meds still aren't quite right for me. Started mine recently (in my 30s) I'm back to school and I am a studying machine. With pills and good habits you can do whatever the hell you want! A friend of mine has terrible eyesight. She wore glasses 24/7 and had a lot of difficulty because of it. She went and got corrective eye surgery finally a few years ago. 

A little while after the surgery she called me crying because she had just taken a shower... AND COULD SEE THE BOTTLES. She could see if she was picking up shampoo, conditioner, could read what it said exactly. 

This is how I felt after getting properly medicated, and it sounds like you feel the same way!

Eventually the mindblowing high of being able to function like a regular human will wear off, but it's totally understandable to be this excited :)  Awesome! I'm rooting for you! 

Can you describe your experience in more detail? 

How does your story compare to these ones [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/44e4l4/for_those_extremely_lucky_people_who_had_a_great/)?  can you describe how you felt before?

super happy for you though :)  Finally got around to setting up my appointment to get tested/diagnosis. Congratulations, I look forward to restarting school once I go on meds.  I don't get this! Why! I see all these people with great success. I have tried many doses for Concerta and now Vyvanse. I went all the way to the max dose for both of them. And now I can tell it's a little better but I don't have this experience. 

Am I just one of those people that won't have it  Congratulations! I have adhd, and i can see clear once in awhile. Although I might try to get on meds too. All the best! How does biphetin compare to Adderall? I have a hard time talking Adderall and Adderall Xr because I can't sleep, and sometimes the comedown gives me anxiety attacks. I have also tried Vyvanse and it made it worse. Maybe I just need to try and stick it out but I just feel like my brain is broken after a night of no sleep. Dude that's sick! Congrats. Meds are awesome, idk how I would survive without them. 


I'm always super hyperactive, anxious, and prone to flashes of anger.  I feel you. I told my husband it was like the meds flipped on my empathy and give a fuck switches--and I knew my give a fuck was broken but I had no idea my ability to read emotions and connect with people was so abysmal. I mean I knew I struggled socially, and I have a degree in interpersonal communication so I understand nonverbal communication theoretically, but until I took adderall I had no idea what I was missing.  Just wondering, what medication are you on? 

I've also started my medication today at 20mg and going to move on to 30mg starting next week (Vyvanse). I hope to achieve the similar results as yours. Biphentin is basically just a new/more expensive Ritalin or Concerta, correct? Welcome to the real world. First day I took the medication, it was like "what the fuck dose ppl feel like this?" I realized that I have ADHD. I start listen and read like normal ppl I have a 20mg perscription right now and I might as well just have 3 cups of coffee. I get some energy but no help focusing. Could a boost in MG be that beneficial? yeah it's great I'm living this moment. Been on meds since July but I'm still amazed how much work I actually get completed  I've been on some form of Ritalin for almost 17 years now. I took Ritalin at varying doses as I grew up, switched to concerts for a few years then back to Ritalin. I've always hesitated on switching my meds but I have been finding it harder and harder to stay focussed- maybe I'm developing an immunity??
Either way tomorrow I start biphentin. I'm starting on a 50mg dose for a week and then going to 60mg. I'm nervous but hopefully I get that feeling of clarity and control again. 
I'm so happy your meds are working for you so well. I know mine have changed my life for the better 

Tl;dr: switching from Ritalin to biphentin tomorrow. Nervous but hopeful [deleted] "Shouting monkey" is now added to my list of descriptors for my friends and family who don't understand what it's like to have an ADHD brain... [deleted] I couldn't tell you, but I've been productive for HOURS today. Still working as we speak (just a quick break to check on this thread). I will keep you guys updated, I have 6 more doses at 30mg, then I'm up to 40mg next. my first thought too... we've all been there RemindMe! 60 days Reading this thread is like a breath of fresh air. When I was on Vyvanse I was constantly angry but very well focused, not a trade off i was willing to take. I'm very glad what you're taking is really helping though :) That's really good to hear. I started a 7.5mg Adderall IR a few days ago, and felt nothing. Now I'm at 15mg and still nothing (except a little dry mouth). Its a little frustrating hearing everyone's stories about how they started medication and everything was different, but its a bit relieving to know I'm not alone. One day, indeed! Same boat, it's been 2 years, but I am still trying.  Ugh. I loved Concerta, and was switched to Adderall and I don't find it as effective.  I love collecting these success stories. 

Which meds worked for you? 

Can you elaborate on how it felt when the "fog" cleared?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/44e4l4/for_those_extremely_lucky_people_who_had_a_great/) are some other success stories. :) I feel you 2000%, currently have 4 more visits spaced out over a month before I even get my yes or no on ADHD (having been diagnosed at a very young age and never sought treatment until now)  Thanks Ginabot.

Before this, I couldn't keep my thoughts in order. It was like like hundreds, even thousands of thoughts bashing in, trying to get my attention. A topic in my head would expand to a web of possibilities pertaining to that specific topic until I get to some sort of 6 degrees of separation of ideas that all connect and my brain just freezes and I shut down. 

When it came to work, I couldn't read without restarting, every noise, thought and object in the room was screaming for my attention. I would walk around my house, forgetting what I needed to do and just be going in circles losing track of time. Sometimes even 10 minutes and up.

Sorry for the long ready but there's lots of things I could describe but that's the jest of it. Honestly trial and error is key. Try straight Ritalin. That helped me learn a lot about how my body reacts to drugs. Because they are concentrated short term doses. Often people don't like it because you get the highs and lows and have to be on top of taking them at the right time (a tall order for ADHD) but I learned a lot about the impact of meds and how they helped me by having those concentrated doses. 
Don't give up. Everyone needs their own balance of therapy, support and sometimes meds. But as anyone with ADHD will tell non ADHD people- we just all need a different approach.  Hi! Sorry for the late response - I'm on Biphentin. MY treatment went as follows: week 1: 20mg week 2: 30mg week 3: 40mg (3 months) and then I have appointments for follow up. Disclaimer: I'm also taking cipralex (20mg) and wellburtrin (150mg) as well. I'm hoping to get off these once my ADHD medication is stable and my symptoms are in control. I don't think so - I read it was actually one of the cheaper options in Canada. Yeah I don't think so. Just chillin' at my home office being productive. This happened to me.  Felt on top of the world for a week.  Didn't realize I was only sleeping 3 hours/ night and not eating.  A month of that and I was a hot mess.

 That look on Biden's face, tho.  Perfectly rational thing to cry about, it was an emotional event for the whole nation. My medication (15mg Adderal) seem to crank my emotional responses up to 11. As a 28 year old male, I cried while watching the first Rocky movie, of all things. Not sure if that is a result of having more focus, or just a side-effect of stimulants.

Anyway, I hope you can find a dosage/solution that works for you.  Pleased to meet you Mr. ... [deleted] Ok, glad to hear you're being super productive! :) Hopefully you don't crash when the meds wear off. Be safe, and keep us posted. We're always happy to hear peoples success stories! You do realize that's the same thing meth addicts say, right? It sounds like you're high more than anything else. I'm not saying you're an addict, just to be careful. It will wear off though. Just be careful because this leads many with ADD to move on to try harder drugs and is a dangerous path.

I was on Adderall for years and at the beginning it did the same thing, but soon I couldn't deal with the side effects. A lack of sleep and rarely eating will do that to a person. I ended up stopping my medication and just had to deal with the ADD.

|-|-|-|-|-|-| I experienced the same thing on Adderall, Ritalin, and Concerta. At first it worked great but as time went on, every night I would have horrible mood swings, depression, anxiety, after the crash of it wearing off. I rarely slept or ate and turned into a zombie. Doctors then put me on other meds to try to help the side effects and before I knew it, I was taking probably 10+ pills a day. Eventually I realized I didn't want to keep living like that and decided suffering with ADD would be better than all the side effects from the meds and stopped taking them. My grades dropped dramatically but I didn't care. I wasn't going to be a zombie again and stayed off them. I think the lucky ones that had fast success are also more likely to share that positive experience. But hey, at least you have a diagnosis! Your body chemistry could be different though,  I'm on 30 MG a day,  just break it into 15s. It works for me,  but maybe your body doesn't have enough receptors to get you to the therapeutic level for your body.   Really? I was on Concerta first and thought Adderall worked much better. I had both regular Adderall for if I had to study on weekends and Adderall XR during school days. Eventually I stopped taking it though because the side effects of not sleeping, not eating, and having serious depression and anxiety were too much. Hey sounds like a normal day for me too except you'd have to add in not only my own 1,000s of thoughts but the 20 to 30 different things that I get told to do day after day at work, the constant phone calls from my daughter's school (she is in kindergarten and I'm pretty sure they are about to tell me she has ADHD because of the twice weekly letters complaining of her hyperactivity in the classroom. I actually had to leave work and get her today to avoid a suspension), the constant reminders of things I should be doing from my well meaning but annoying boyfriend, and a whole host of other reminders of shit I forgot. 

I have an appointment later this month and hopefully I'll get some help when I go. They didn't want to do a diagnosis without a childhood diagnosis. I did some deep digging and managed to get the paperwork from when I was in 2nd grade (it was not easy) and am going to bring it with me. 

I have a few questions for you:

How much has it helped with memory? My boyfriend's nickname for me is Dory and it's pretty well chosen.

Has it helped you not lose items any? I spend half my day at work trying to recover misplaced items.

Did you lose track of time a lot before treatment? Sometimes I won't look at a clock for a while and next thing I know it's after 6pm and apparently I'm the only one still in the building at work or maybe I had an appointment at 2pm and remembered at lunch but then before I knew it it was 3pm and I missed it. Sometimes at home I'll be doing something and look up holy shit it's 1:30 in the morning and I have to wake up at 5am. More than a few times I've been doing stuff and holy shit it's 4:30am looks like another day with no sleep for me. If you had this problem has medication helped it in any way? 
 thanks for your reply! great to hear that you're feeling better now. i'm asking this just out of my personal anthropological interest and curiosity: when you take the medicament - it improves your state immediately and then you get back to your ADHD state once the effect starts wearing off? does the dose last until end of the day? does it get better with time, if taking the medication regularly? 

edit: get better with time- i meant, does the effect lasts longer after a longer treatment? for example, if you'd take the medication for 2-3 months- you'll feel better overall or the effect is merely temporary as long as the medication works and doesn't wear off the same day? Ya I stoped with meds, they didn't really help me out.  They just didn't do anything for me. And it's not like I got high from it like other people use it for I switched from concerta to Ritalin due to price. I'm now insured again but am going to try biphentin. I just turned 26 and got a new job making some decent money with benefits. But for years I argued OHIP should help me out, the month I get my job they announce they will help people that were in the position I struggled with for years by converting prescription drugs.  Yeah, I lost thirty pounds in thirty days while on Adderall. Had to stop that for a bit. It didn't help that I didn't much money to spend on food at the time. I second this. I still like it and it's helpful but that feeling is on a time limit. Although I found myself needing to eat more and I slept fine but I also wasn't taking it twice a day like I was supposed to I didn't realize lol. Same thing here. I now hate ADD meds because of the side effects. haha, I'm doing stuff. I've been curious about the effects. Does recalling things become easier? Plus the whole, go into a room to get something, forget why, maybe I'll remember (that's really only if it was to help with a started project).  Hey prick, I'm actually a recovering addict. Get bent. I'm happy.

[Edit] - prick was harsh. Just woke up and this was the first thing I read. I appreciate the advice. Same here, they make me autistic and antisocial and cause hyperfocus even in low doses. Looking into non stimulants now Hi! I hope it all works for you.

- Memory: it's been okay, this is the first day I actually felt a difference. My morning was smooth, I remember I made coffee, so I have that going for me which is nice.

- Losing items: I am happy to report I did not lose anything today. We'll see if that sticks.

- Tracking time: Yes, I often lose track of time. It actually would fly over my head. Since I work from home it's easy for that to happen but I'm pretty aware of where I need to be later tonight and so far on track to be on time.
 Hi Ginabot,

Thank you! I feel an improvement certainly within the hour or so, it's super gradual now that I got the first few stronger treatments out of the way. It usually lasts about 10-12 hours, but I notice it wear off by the evening if I take it around 9am. I began taking it a little later on in the day since I work from home and my days are usually longer than the normal 9-5. 

In terms of getting better with time, I'm fresh on my on treatment plan so I'm yet to figure that one out. I'll let you guys know for sure! I was on dexedrine, which is apparently supposed to be an appetite suppresser sometimes prescribed for weight loss... But I ended up gaining weight!

Body was like... You're not sleeping and you're not eating?? Omg, we are in mortal danger!  Don't worry, I'll store tons of fat for you!!! We totally got this!! You have no idea how lucky you are your sleep wasn't affected! Meds don't make up for sleep deprivation, so after a week I was in far worse shape than I was pre-diagnosis!  Are you totally med free now?  How are you doing? You did a pretty good job, Mr. Biden! Cant speak for OPs medication, but for my 15mg Adderall, it certainly does help with recall. Not quite like on that move Limitless, but it will help you immediately recall those "tip-of-my-tongue" things. And you won't often find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there. Instead, you'll walk into the room, do the 1, 2, or 10 things you went into the room to do in the proper order, all while planning out what you're going to do in the next room you enter.  [deleted] First, I'm a female. Second, I'm a recovering addict too, not with stimulants though, my main DOC was opiates/heroin. I hated stimulants as they made my anxiety and depression 10000 times worse. I'm sorry if you thought I was calling you a meth addict, that wasn't my intention. I have Asperger's and don't always phrase things in the best way, I apologize. I meant to say to be careful because stimulant ADD drugs are similar to meth and can give a similar, but much milder, high and it can make them addictive. I'm glad it's helping you. It helped me at first but it quickly wore off and then made it worse. I pray it keeps working for you. I was put on many non-stimulants, one of them was Strattera, and none of them did anything for me. Some actually made me fall asleep in class. I'm not saying they won't work for you but don't get overly optimistic. Hopefully medication will help some with my memory. It's really bad. I remember I forgot the name one of the guys I had been working with for over 2 years. I was also the first person to bring him to my work when he first got there. He caught me attempting to sneak a peek at his name tag and commented on it. I was pretty embarrassed. I forget birthdays, holidays, my kids names, where I am going when I am driving, why I went to the store, what I went into a room for, what I am doing while I am doing it, appointments  (thank smart phones for reminders if I remember to set them up), I've accidentally left the stove on overnight after cooking more than once same for the oven, forgot to buy groceries or make the list, and a metric fuck ton of other stuff. I can't tell you how many times I've left my keys or phone in a store only to realize it after getting to my car. I used to have a roommate who broke her collar bone at work a few years ago. I was there when it happened (we both fell on some bleachers when they collapsed), helped her get dressed for weeks and many other things. One day she came in to work and I was like "OMG what happened to your arm!" because she had her sling on (which she had been wearing the whole time). She thought I was messing with her. There was also a hole in front of one of the doorways I tripped over multiple times every single day despite working in the same place for 15 months. I just kept forgetting it was there or rushing around where it was at. It's so frustrating and can be embarrassing at times.

 I usually tell people when I first meet them that my memory is really bad and ask them not to take offense if I forget their name. We have some new people at work and I know at least one of them I've introduced myself to about three times now asking when they got there and where they are from. At least once when they said where they were from I've asked "Have we had this conversation before?" their hometown jogged my memory and I felt like an idiot. 

Any improvement no matter how small would be a blessing.  Totally med free? No. I have other health issues so I take some other meds, but no meds for ADD. I couldn't stand the horrible side effects so I could either take them and do well in school/professionally and be suicidal every night, or stop taking them and not be suicidal so the choice was easy. I'm still struggling but I have been working with a therapist for a while to try to have coping skills and attempt to learn skills to try to keep organized (which is almost impossible for me but I try). Yeah, I stopped taking them either junior or senior year of high school. My grades went from honors to Cs and Ds, but I didn't care. I wasn't going to continue being a drugged up zombie. I'm now in my late 20s and it's just something I have to deal with. It does get better after all the school/college is done. I tried every medication and every type of therapy and even alternative medicine like acupuncture, yoga, stuff like that, nothing helped my physical symptoms. I just work with a therapist and have learned ways to try to manage my ADD and try to learn to be as organized as possible (which isn't easy for me) and have a whole system I set up to *attempt* to keep me focused. I work as a computer tech and have no problem focusing on computer work. I can look at the clock and then look again and discover several hours have passed. But I have had problems at certain jobs because I repeatedly forget or misplace things and bosses don't like that. Don't ask me to read a textbook because that will take forever. My instinct is to hide in this barrel, like the wily fish. That's the part I was curious about. Stuff I know etc, then go to think of it and it's there but won't come out. Plus most projects I have to plan and make sure I have everything, yet still forget a bunch. Been considering going to be retested, was diagnosed in my early teens.  Oh god I hate that, talking to chashiers and other noise is around, all I hear is womp womp. Someone sidetracks my train of thought and it screws me all up. Go to reread stuff a billion times. Misread and think wtf, read a few more times then I got it. It's all good - I shouldn't have been so defensive, but I'm still fighting it and the urges have been pretty bad lately. After revisiting my comment I realized you had good intentions and it's the internet so tone is hard to gauge. Thank you for your insight, I learn more everyday on this thread! Best of luck on your journey, keep fighting the good fight :) I have Modafinil as secret weapon if the non stims are too sedating I stopped taking my strattera about two months ago, and I'm happier with the way I've felt now vs. the way I've felt for the past 3+ years I was on it. I don't feel so hazy all the time anymore, but I do have more trouble getting back go focus. Hopefully my doc will figure something out for me though.  Oh my gosh, I hear you on the time blindness... It's insane. 

 I've only been recently diagnosed (October, 2016) and although I haven't found the right treatment yet, not feeling totally alone is nice.  I've always felt so different and broken...   I feel bad seeing this because I responded well to my medication.   I admit I'm jealous. I did so much better in school and at work on the meds but the side effects weren't worth it. I wouldn't have actually committed suicide (I have a friend that did when I was younger and from that moment on, I knew I never wanted to do that, no matter what), but I didn't want to exist anymore.
