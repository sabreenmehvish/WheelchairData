Tips for remembering things? I am driving my parents insane. My memory has become a lot worse than it was when I was originally diagnosed, and it's really beginning to mess things up. For example, I have lost 3 sets of retainers. It is becoming really difficult to even retain very simple details like: phone numbers, names, words, and instructions. Although, things that are in my long term memory, I can blurt out with complete competence. How do you guys remember things? Start with the assumption that you will forget everything. There are a couple ways to deal with that fact. First, write everything down. If you have a phone, that can be your best friend. Everything goes into your Notepad. Grocery list, random ideas, to do lists. Anything that you need to  do in the future gets a reminder set in your calendar (with an alarm). 

As far as not losing things, you have to get into the habit of doing a check any time you are leaving a location. Have a checklist that you evaluate every single time - wallet, keys, phone, retainers, etc.

If you are talking to someone and have a thought but can't write it down, try crossing your fingers and associating the thought with those fingers. If a second thing you want to remember comes up, cross your other two fingers. Then, don't uncross your fingers until you get a chance to write down the thoughts.  I always put things in the exact same place. Bowl by the door for my keys, wallet and knife. I carry a backpack everywhere all the time and if I have something unusual that I don't want to lose (money, meds, tools, papers, whatever) they go straight in the backpack. If someone tells me to do something, like do the dishes or homework or pressure wash the cat, I immediately put it on my phone calendar as soon as they tell me to do it.  write everything down. keep frequently used and important objects in the same location. i.e. retainer goes in the nightstand drawer, always. 

for some lists visualizations help, i.e. for grocery shopping lists I write everything and visualize the order of going through the store and getting each item. 

but yeah, write everything down. post-it notes, memo pad, notebook, notecards, whatever works. physically writing things down is more likely to stay in your memory.  I literally warn people as soon as they introduce themselves that I *will* forget their name, immediately.  I created an external brain - my "Hipster PDA."   

Stack of disc bound index cards (seriously, I just bought 1500 of those puppies today) that I carry with me everywhere. In fact, I am laying on my bed typing right now, and on my night table is a little container with a bunch of index cards and a pen in it.

I just write **everything** down on them. One thought per card ("ubiquitous capture" or something if you like your GTD). I know I can't rely on my own brain, so I don't even try.   Are you on meds? Half of the reason I have a shitty memory off-meds because I am inattentive when I'm told what I need to remember. Repeat important things out loud, repeatedly. That seems to help me a little bit. My memory isn't quite that bad, but it's bad enough that I lose my keys/wallet in some unknown places in my house all the time. I started keeping track of my life with my smartphone. I put anywhere I have to be at a certain time in my calendar, and set it to remind me at a reasonable time before. Shopping lists get added to Google Keep the second I think of something I need to get while I'm out (Keep has a feature that reminds you about a note you took when you're close to a certain location, like my local Kroger).

If you don't have a smartphone, it's certainly possible to just grab a day planner and keep it with you at all times. Make it part of your routine to write down everything you need to do. Meds

Also trying to repeat the thing you need to do in your head so many times so when a distraction comes (and it will come) you are more likely to remember it due to repetition.  If you forget **visualize very well and detailed** (aka using your imagination) what you were doing when the distraction happened, try to recapture the thought, and it may actually be recovered. The more senses you are able to use when you try to remember, the more details you can visualize the more likely you will trigger the memory. Yeah, I am taking a break over the summer. Even on meds I have a hard time remembering things, but it is exacerbated when I am not on them...
