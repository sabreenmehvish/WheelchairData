Dating someone with ADHD Any tips? What are your experiences dating someone with ADHD? 

Just to clarify- I’m very happy in my relationship. I just want to hear others’ experiences and advice so that I can understand my boyfriend better.  Be PATIENT. Understand that sometimes, we just can't. It's not an excuse and shouldn't be a crutch but on bad days mundane tasks (like chores)  take too much energy. Keeping that in mind will save you a lot of frustration when you're like "why can't he just keep his damn room clean?!?"   For me being diagnosed with ADHD, I rely on my non-ADHD friends a lot to retain details and to remember where conversations are at, because I constantly forget what I’m talking about, half of the time mid-sentence, and I really struggle to listen and respond in an appropriate timing and manner. It’s helpful for me when people try to stay focused on our conversation so that when I lose my train of thought, they can help redirect me back.

Making sure you’re on top of small details is always extremely helpful. Keeping track of when your SO has events going on, such as doctors appointments, meetings, needing to call someone, etc. and reminding them about it. If they feel like you’re being controlling or are getting annoyed at that, just take notes of those kinds of things, and ask them a random question about it. They might not admit that they had forgotten, but it will remind them while also not making them feel like you’re trying to baby them. 

It’s super helpful when you can pay attention to where your SO sets things down, like their phone, a pen, etc. I can’t even remember the last time that I set something down and then didn’t spend a minimum of several minutes looking for it when I went to get it again. I lose my JUUL vape constantly, so my roommates make a mental note of it whenever they see it laying around the apartment, so that when I inevitably ask them if they’ve seen it, they’re able to tell me. It’s extremely helpful.

When your SO asks you to repeat something you said, it’s not because they didn’t want to listen or don’t care. They tried to listen, thought they were listening, and then realized once you finished that they didn’t actually comprehend the information. This happens to me an uncountable number of times everyday. It’s the most awful feeling realizing that, and at that point you either can lie and pretend you heard what they had said (we’re really good at that), or hearing what you said is really important to us, so we ask you to repeat it because we want to listen. It’s embarrassing and you feel ridiculously rude every time, but it’s how it goes. So just know if your SO is continually asking you to repeat yourself, it’s not easy to do and it’s because they really care about conversing with you! 

I know that was rather detailed and specific, but I figure there’s too much to put for general advice. Hope this helps, please feel free to comment or PM me with any other questions you might have!

TL;DR: Be attentive and observant, remember details of things whenever you can because your SO is not able to as easily, especially when it comes to social interactions. Keep track of conversations so that if your SO gets lost or forgets what they said, you can bring them back on topic. Try to be mindful of where they’re “most used” personal items everyday are (phone, water bottle, etc.) so that when they lose them, you’re able to help because you made a mental note of where that thing was. Help your SO remember when they have appointments, phone calls they have to make, or other obligations. Try not to get upset if you have to repeat yourself often, it just means that they care so much about hearing you that they’re willing to go through the embarrassment of asking you to repeat yourself to get the full story. Don't take random stuff they forget personally, just ask why if you are unsure. Adhd people have a tendency to forget things they care about too, it just gets lost in the chaos haha r/ADHD_partners     😊  Thank you so much! I actually appreciate the length and detail :)
