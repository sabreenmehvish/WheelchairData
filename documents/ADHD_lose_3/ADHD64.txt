VENT ABOUT BEING A WOMAN AND NOT BEING DIAGNOSED D:< I don't get it. I swear I am a text book example of what ADHD looks like in women, but no one sees it. I hate myself. I feel so stupid like 80&#37; of the time. I go off on tangents in the middle of conversations because what I am saying seems to make sense with the current conversation in my head but rarely to anyone elses'. My social skills are non existent. 

I am a mom. I have 2 kids who rely on my to remember appointments and recitals. Paperwork and even just to remember to tell them to bathe is a struggle some days. If it weren't for my husband idk what I would do!

I am just so frustrated. The weirdest thing happened tonight, where I was in the middle of this lengthy description of something at a family gathering when my husband asked me to cut him a piece of cake. I cut the cake, but then proceeded to eat it and of course everyone had a good laugh because I am just SO ditzy and hilarious. But what they don't see is how it's killing me inside because I don't want to be this way anymore. But no one listens. Instead I got diagnosed with PTSD and borderline after I tried to kill myself in January because I just can't deal with it. 

I can't keep jobs. I lose everything from my phone to my keys constantly. I lose paperwork. Matter of fact I realized like months ago that I left my set of car keys at the movie theater but I am so afraid of everyone thinking it's just another quirky me thing that I don't even want to say anything to anyone or try to get them back. 

I have been out of work since November because I know there's just something off. And the medication for my current diagnosis did NOTHING. But saying any of this just makes it seem like I want adderall. 

And frick, maybe I do. BECAUSE MAYBE I HAVE THE DAMN DISEASE AND IT'S RUINING MY LIFE.  and crap it's 4 AM Im sorry, I can relate. Seems like whenever its talked about around family they just dont seem to understand how painful it is If it’s possible, see if you can go to a child psychiatrist (many who specialize in child psychiatry also see a handful of adults).  They tend to be more aware of and experienced with ADHD than other psychiatrists.  I was treated for bulimia and depression before I finally got diagnosed with ADHD.  I had the exact same life story told to different psychs and it’s clear that they each saw the diagnosis they were most familiar with — oddly like those outdated ink blot tests.

Whether you are able to do that or have to stick with your current doc, please do bring up the ADHD question.  “Do you think maybe I could have ADHD?”  The worst that could happen is that this doc doesn’t agree.  If you’ve not had a history of drug abuse I sincerely doubt your current doc will think you are drug-seeking rather than answer-seeking.  

Edit:  as far as ADHD needing to be present in childhood, you are a witness to your childhood.  Your doctor may take your own recollections about school struggles and “I’ve been messy and forgetful, much more than my peers, for as long as I can remember”.  Likewise, the doctor who diagnosed you as with PTSD probably didn’t need someone else to corroborate the trauma that led to it.  

 I have DEFINITELY had these symptoms all my life. In school I was a day dreamer. I got decent grades because I tested well, but homework I never had the organizational skills to complete. I've also always been able to hyper focus. I love to read, but if a book doesn't grab my attention within the first chapter I never finish it. 

I draw, cross stitch, paint, play video games, program when I am hyper focused in it enough to do it. I have always been quiet and I have always been over stimulated by large groups and gatherings. Like, can't even go to Walmart sometimes without ripping my hair out. 

I used to think it was all just really bad social anxiety. I definitely have anxiety now, but from what I've researched that is very common in people who have been misdiagnosed. I've always felt like I wasn't good enough. 

When I was a kid, it was school. "I could do better." "Everyone else can remember to turn in their assignment, why can't I?" I can remember being treated awfully by teachers. In 3rd grade I was paddled almost everyday by my teacher because I couldn't remember to bring my work in. 

Edit: I should say that I was neglected pretty badly as a kid. My parents never cared about how I did in school. And anyways, as far as they could tell I did well enough to pass so whatever. 

The PTSD diagnosis came from being molested by a much older cousin from the age of like 4 till I was 12. I am a self harmer which is why my therapist says they tacked BPD on me. But I've read some places that state self harm and adhd in girls sort of go hand in hand. 

I just don't get it. I want to feel better. I took off from a pretty nice job in November of 2017 to work on myself. I work in a school and I know I could kick ass at the job if only I could figure out how to fix my brain. 

I've been on prozac, wellbutrin, lexapro, xanax, pot (PTSD diagnosis where I am means I get medical) 

I've been on a few anxiety meds other than xanax but I can't remember the names, not benzos. Even ambien because I can't sleep sometimes. (Like last night, and now it's 8AM and I've gotten 3 hours of sleep)

I've tried all of this to treat the anxiety and depression and it helped a bit but I still forgot everything. I still zoned out all the time. 
 You sound like me. \*hugs\*  


I have an appointment to see a psych next month, and I worry that they'll just handwave my issues away.   


I've been this way all my life - always in trouble for losing things, forgetting things, not doing homework etc. Constant refrain of 'if you would just try harder/pay more attention...'  


So I feel ya. I wish people understood. Sorry, you sound a lot like me when I'm off my meds. If available in your area, look for psychs or practices that actually specialize in ADHD, that is what it took for me. Everyone else wanted it to be anxiety or drinking too much or oh everyone feels that way sometimes. 
If you have any of your elementary school records still, a stretch I know, bring anything that illustrates that you've been presenting these symptoms since then. It helped me a lot to do this. Wait. You attempted suicide in January, and last night your husband set you up to embarrass you in front of your extended family? As much as it sounds like he has been a great support for all of the day-to-day things, he was way out of line by doing that.

It is very hard to get the right treatment without someone advocating for you. I have bipolar and ADHD, and I don't know what I would have done if one of my best friends had not convinced her GP to take me on as a patient (she doesn't have room for more) after hearing about what I had been going through with my meds. Another friend of mine has severe chronic pain and therefore has to take narcotic medication, and her husband attends all of her appointments with her to serve as a witness to ensure that she is not stigmatized and stereotyped. We are in a difficult position, and we need love and care just like anyone with an obvious physical disability does.

If you can budget it, I would suggest getting an assessment from a clinical psychologist who specializes in ADHD and has experience working with personality and mood disorders. A document from a psych that outlines in detail exactly which symptoms you exhibit and which methods were used to diagnose you will help a lot in getting you the right treatment. As mine explained to me, psychiatrists are well-qualified to diagnose, but if they only have half and hour or forty-five minutes with you to decide what's happening, how accurate and thorough can they be?

If you still find that you're not getting medication for you ADHD, or you are seriously affected by the stigma of seeking stimulant medication, you may want to ask your care providers for Strattera. Strattera is a non-stimulant ADHD medication, so you are asking for treatment without asking for a restricted drug. If I didn't receive the help that I got from my friend and my GP, this was my plan. Strattera is a second-line treatment, so it isn't ideal, but no one will withhold it from you out of fear that you might abuse it.

Good luck. You are entitled to treatment, and you are showing great courage and responsibility by accepting that you have a disability and seeking the right remedy for it. I hope that soon your family will learn this maturity and give you the support and encouragement that you deserve. Definitely try to find someone who specializes in neurodevelopmental disorders.

I’m assigned female (I’m a trans man) and was seen as a girl for my childhood. I had super obvious symptoms: being known for staring out a window for hours instead of working, turning everything in late (or not at all), losing stuff, getting distracted all the time, forgetting directions, taking twice as long as everyone else to get stuff done... basically identical to my older brother’s symptoms. His elementary school teachers commented and recommended that he get evaluated. I had two of the same teachers, but they totally ignored my symptoms in favor of viewing me as lazy and ditzy.

I only got diagnosed with ADHD because my twin brother is autistic and we decided to get me evaluated too, and the ADHD was super obvious to the neuropsychologist I saw. I actually had a different psychological evaluation a few years back because of depression and anxiety, and I scored really high for ADHD, and then they just... didn’t diagnose me. They told me I had clear symptoms, it was in the papers they gave me about the evaluation, but I was a teenage girl (in their eyes), and they just didn’t follow through with a diagnosis. So I can relate to your pain, and I’m sorry you feel like your symptoms are being ignored and explained away with other diagnoses.

If you can find someone who knows ADHD well and isn’t likely to be biased against diagnosing it, that’s your best shot at knowing for sure. Based on your description of your childhood in your earlier comment, you do sound like one of us to me. But ultimately my opinion holds no weight, and I’m not a neuropsychologist, so I can’t accurately evaluate you, I can just say that I really relate to the way you describe yourself.  Is this something that you've had/felt your entire life? Or is this something that's just started happening? ADHD starts in childhood, it's not something that just happens. I'm saying this because if this is a new thing, it might be a symptom of another neurological disease.

Go to a psychiatrist and ask them to give you an ADHD test. Ask your parents or people from your childhood if you've always had these symptoms to make sure this isn't a new thing.

I know you're busy with your life, but start looking into YT channels like "How to ADHD". Read articles for strategies. There are also podcasts, books, etc.

Literally set reminders for everything. If you’re not already on medication, go see a doctor. I have ADD not H. My brain functions completely different while I’m on my meds- a good different. I’m not completely overwhelmed with multiple incomplete thoughts and anxiety of not being able to complete tasks.  [deleted] I'm sorry things have been so hard for you.  Your cake story is absolutely something I would do and that's even with meds. I have a lot of similar experiences. I hope you are able to find a doctor that is willing to listen to you. If it helps the way I realized I needed to get diagnosed was a WebMD article and I had 10 out of 10 signs of Adult ADHD [10 Problems That Could Mean Adult ADHD](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/10-symptoms-adult-adhd#1). You shouldn't need to prove yourself to anyone but its possible it could help you to be heard. I hope things get better for you. You are not alone, and to steal a line from another  r/ADHD post,  we're all a little fucked up. What kind of doctor are you seeing? There are a few approaches. One would be to talk to a therapist, who can give you a referral. I would look for a therapist that has ADD listed as a specialty. The other option is to make an appointment with a psychiatrist who treats patients with ADD. I am female and I know how frustrating it is. Keep trying and trust your instincts. As a Mom with ADHD I feel for you. I was lucky enough to be diagnosed at a young age but if I weren't medicated I don't know how I'd cope. I parented for years without my medication and I was a shit show by the time I got back on Concerta.  It's really hard going through life with not getting the proper help. Because when you look back you just think about how much it would of helped you. There for how much better you believe you would feel if so. My parents didn't neglect me put pushed the "you can do better, only if you trie a bit harder." "Oh she's just acting out because of her period." "You have anger problems. Nothing else." "We are going to try to fix you by focusing on the wrong thing." 
I went it about it all on my own when I moved out and went to University. I realized that I was having such a hard time with the little things and needed help. I didn't have the support system that I needed during that time. So sadly I stopped. 
Now after almost dying in a major car accident, because I had to many things going on in my head that I didn't think it all the way through. Almost died from it. I'm still in recovery. Then also paying so much attention while I'm driving and I end up going through a red light, and almost got in another bad crash. I was so focused and paying attention but I still missed that red light. 
Hang in there and keep asking about it. Bring it up all the time and maybe look into making time to see a councilor. They can help with coming up with ways to organize and someone to talk to.  Dude I relate...at work yesterday one of my nice coworkers was the announcer for a game show type of thing. On the mic she asked me to get her a bottle of water and I said sure, went to the bar to get it, immediately forgot. Then an hour later when it was done I remembered she wanted one so I told her I was going to go get it and immediately forgot it again. My brain. Just. Does not work in my favor. Ever. I feel you. I’m female, going back for my msn and at 44 there is no record of anything I could possibly find to prove my issues as a kid. My parents are gone and I have no siblings.  My adult kids who’ve watched me struggle and are diagnosed were all I have. 

Because my insurance is garbage for mental health my gp grudgingly prescribed a light dose of meds. Of course the caveat is if I’m not in school I don’t “need” the meds. Go figure. 

It feels like the equivalent of being told to put your feet in the stirrups when you have a migraine. 

You can do this, just keep plugging away at it. 

 I really don’t want this to sound insensitive, but if you’ve been to a professional, and they didn’t diagnose you with something, you may not have it. Mental disorders are complex problems that don’t have an easy solution. While I empathize with you, and I know you’re trying to vent, I encourage you to talk to a professional and try to get back to normalcy, whatever that may be. Then talk to a specialist about ADHD.

If you get a prescription right now, there is a possibility that it won’t work and cause you to be depressed again. Again, there is no easy solution.


This might sound callous, but I feel like it is extremely important to say: you are not a doctor. You cannot diagnose yourself.


I’m the meantime, talk to someone. Whether it’s a therapist, your best friend, or your husband, just talk to someone and I hope everything works out for you.  I got my BA in psychology, which was clearly an attempt to better understand myself. My master’s is in legal studies. It was a coin toss and I had no idea how much I would like law. It’s actually a great fit for me. I work as a senior corporate paralegal for a tech company. If I were younger, I’d go to law school in a heart beat. I’d also throw in a computer science degree for fun. Hi, I read your post.

So I've been with an experienced therapist for about a year now, and I thought I could share some of my experiences with you. A bit of backstory: 2015 I was diagnosed with ADHD, actually with a lot of the symptoms you've described in your post and the comments below. I'm constantly ditsy, forgetful - I interrupt people sentences because I've caught a train of thought that is going somewhere vaguely where the discussion was going but I've stopped listening intently so I just barge in - yada yada. I zone out constantly, or lock onto something so harshly that I lose hours into it (be it a videogame or a wikipedia/youtube binge or something else that happens to stimulate me at the time).

I got medicated with concerta in 2016 and I've been on it since, yes it helps me. I get that your post in general is a massive rant on what seems to be a difficult journey through the healthcare system, I'm sorry you've had to go through this. I just wanted to pitch in with some things.

I have PTSD too - my current therapist is at least on that route. I went through some shitty childhood things with a lot of absent parenting, I'm a pretty insecure and tense person. I don't feel safe in a lot of places and it makes me kind of a nervous control freak on top of everything else. My therapist has been very clear in explaining this to me though: **A lot of PTSD symptoms align with the symptoms surrounding ADHD.** Me having PTSD doesn't rule out me having ADHD (or vice versa) - but to try and assess what's what isn't something that she considers to be in my best interest (another mark of a good therapist - they look to make your life better rather than slot you into the right type of compartment). 

Medication helped, but it helps with more superficial things and I like to see it as my crutch so I don't burn out early in the day. The biggest change for me is that the crutch makes me better at implementing routines. The best thing though was when I got my job last summer. My new job is very linear in that I hardly ever have to work overtime and I usually manage to have very structured put together days which don't change too much. Add on to that it's given me an option for a discounted gym card for a facility between the bus and office which now means I exercise nearly every morning before going into work... Well, really that's made the best change in my life so far. Routines which I've never previously been able to hold in my life has actually made me such a calmer happier person. The routines didn't come with the meds, but they've been easier to implement than previously.

My therapist insists that routines is the key to handling both of these - ADHD and PTSD is mostly handled by just scheduling the hell out of your entire life. Down to whether you brush your teeth before or after getting your clothes on in the morning. For my PTSD we're also working on creating my own safe space - but routines is what makes treatment work because I will be able to "mentally rest" in my routines. I won't freak out because I know exactly what I'm doing. 

If you read this far, thanks, I really want you to read this: You are worth a more thorough work-up with a mental healthcare proffessional. You don’t have to feel like you have to prove that you don’t have PTSD to prove that you have ADHD - they align a lot and it’s extremely common to have multiple mental health problems on top of your ADHD. You’re worth getting someone to listen to you and help you work to make your life work - what saddens me the most about your post was reading about your frustration. I used to be that frustrated myself. Try and find someone who is interested in helping you make your life work, start there and know that while road to recovery is often long and complicated it happens. And there’s better stuff ahead <3 To be diagnosed with legit adhd it has to be present when you were a kid. If you have school reports or your parents to clarify that then take them to you dr and make another appointment  [deleted] They went through years of med school and see patients every day. If you picked a good one, they'll know what they're doing and the majority (of doctors) do genuinely care about their patients and their health.

If you've picked a specific psych privately, or picked a clinic, it's very unlikely they'd brush your issues away. I wouldn't worry about that. Just explain your issues and have a conversation when the appointment comes. I'm not even sure how to get the records. I live very far from my hometown now. 

I was honestly considered a "gifted" student in school, I just "didn't apply myself". My grades, till middle school, stayed pretty nice. I dropped out in 9th grade.  I get that you're voicing a concern, but my husband was not setting me up for embarrassment by asking me to cut a piece of cake. I was sitting nearest to the cake, I just happened to be talking at the same time. He didn't point out it was his cake. His mom did.  Thank you. My frustration comes from the fact that I've been in INTENSIVE treatment since November of last year. I don't understand why no one has thought to at least give me some type of evaluation to see if I could, maybe, have ADHD. 

When I first went in I'll admit that I definitely wasn't stable. I had a miscarriage months before hand and I basically stuffed the feelings and they came out in the form of a drinking problem, which also brought up a lot of feelings from when I was abused. I remember talking to the psych at this treatment center and he said, very dismissively that we'd come to that after we've sorted through everything else. 

I kind of feel like telling him that I thought I COULD have ADHD just set me up for him to never take me seriously. He never acted like my anxiety was as bad as it was and it was the strangest thing, because I was complaining of the anxiety and the lack of focus and mentioned minimally that I had problems sleeping (not anything too serious, I don't have insomnia) and he prescribed me Ambien?

I don't like drugs like that! I mean, I smoke medical pot, but benzos? Sleeping pills? Keep that shit away from me. But at this point I am begging for someone to look into my concerns and just tell me if a stim would help or not. 

Sorry. Tangent.  ADD was scrapped a fair while ago. ADD would be ADHD-PI now. The general principle is that everyone with ADHD exhibits some inattentive and hyperactivity symptoms, but the majority of their impairment may be focused on one area, or in both. Thanks It's strange because I once had thought maybe I had ADHD. But then I was hospitalized and I got diagnosed with PTSD and Borderline. I never felt the borderline fit. But I basically convinced myself that the PTSD thing MUST be it. I've been in with a trauma therapist since I left the hospital in Jan and I feel that I have taken control of the events that caused me to have PTSD symptoms. Flashbacks, reliving it, etc. I haven't had an experience that I'd label PTSD SINCE I left the hospital. 

I feel like I'm mostly over it. I've made my peace with it and I am very frustrated to have weeded that garden only to realize that those symptoms I had thought were ADHD previously were STILL THERE. and I know if I don't get a handle on it, I'll end up in the same situation I was in before. 

Edit: wanted to mention that I plan on talking to my therapist tomorrow about this. I've never brought it up with her seeing as I've tried to accept PTSD as my only diagnosis. I thought once I figured that mess out things in my brain would chiill. 

It didnt.  I forget everything. I hate that report cards are online now. I always forget to check them. I forget to put money in their lunch accounts till we are 20 bucks in the negative. I misplace their library books when I clean because I have this bad habit of "organizing" by shoving stuff in random places. 

I forget to wash their clothes or to fold them. I know it isn't cause I am just lazy. I work my ass off and I know it! But if my mind isn't on laundry and pretty much ONLY laundry I forget wet stuff in the wash for days before I remember OH YEAH LAUNDRY. 

It's frustrating. I know that I don't KNOW for certain if I suffer from ADHD, but I don't get why I can't at least be tested by someone.  I appreciate it. But this isn't something I've decided I COULD have over night. This is something I've set with for months. 

I have sought treatment for the trauma. I have a therapist. But literally anytime I mention how I feel that I MAY relate to this illness, I am always met with doubt when dealing with healthcare professionals. At this point I just want a professional to hear me out and at least test me thoroughly and then come to as educated of an answer as possible. 

I had a rough day yesterday, but honestly I am riding my base line right now. This is me with no depression and minimal anxiety. Hey, you're right! I didn't respond last night, but I read your last bit to my husband last night because it hit me so hard. I cried. Thank you! I think it depends on the place, when I got tested part of it was just me talking to them and the second part was them talking to me, my parents and a friend. 

They said they could diagnose it as well without 'witnesses' to my youth (in case I didn't have them/wanted to bring them), but then it would have been a different proces (more talks spread out over a few weeks, instead of one 3 hour one). 

Not saying you're wrong, ADHD needs to have been present in childhood (even if it wasn't a problem then, but clear in hindsight), just don't want to have the OP think "oh crap, don't have these things" and give up.  It may also depend on your age. When I was a kid, ADHD had just been labeled and the vast majority of people didn’t even know it was a thing. I was diagnosed when I was a freshman in undergrad. The next year I went on meds, and it was a disaster. I managed to not be on meds for almost the next decade when I finally just couldn’t cope anymore and broke down. I ended up enrolling in a drug trial at a university close by me where I was tested again. Needless to say, I was accepted into the program.
I’ve had to go off of meds again, and it SUCKS (I moved countries and have been dragging my feet trying to find an English-speaking doctor in a country not exactly known for mental health support). 
Oh—and female as well. And “quirky” as well. 
I leave the house about four times each time I need to head out somewhere. 
And, I’m really, desperately hoping my wedding bands that I can’t find are just hidden in a really smart place.  I have gotten tons of therapy. The abuse is something I've acknowledged and it doest have power over me like it did when I was younger. I had thought before that perhaps I have ADHD. Got into therapy, group therapy for a while with a partial hospitalization program. Still see a therapist once a week. They never wanted to treat me for ADHD because of that, but at this point it's very clearly NOT the trauma. I accepted it as such for months but I've reached a point where I am not depressed. Not quite something you can move away from completely but the mess of my life and the trauma just seem to be 2 very different beasts.  I definitely agree with you! I found a specific ADHD clinic near me, but I still want to touch base with my therapist before I make the appointment.  I don’t know if my other comment came up as I didn’t reply to you per say, but elsewhere in the thread. 
You shouldn’t need records. If you can’t find them, go to a practice where they specialize in ADHD people and they will retest you.
Which is its own special hell. 

And, hang in there. The things that’s helped me the most is accepting my strengths and stopping beating myself up for my weaknesses. And, yes, WAY easier said than done. I’m typing that while looking at the mound of clothes all around my bed and running through all of the places I could have put my wedding rings and wondering if I’ve looked there (I have). I’ve crawled in the back of closets and sat in my garage on a hot as hell day bawling my eyes out because I can’t function like an adult (I’m 40). 

I finally had to take a step back and force myself to accept my brain is a hot fucking mess, but it’s MY hot fucking mess that is intelligent, creative, impetuous, stubborn, and empathetic. I’m 99% sure my eldest had my brain, and don’t want her to feel less because her brain is wired different. 

Deep breaths. 
Being a female with this sucks because of the “ditzy” label. 
Meh

Fuck ‘em

Oh—and just go get your keys.  They probably have multiple sets, so they wont think twice   (ideally before Christmas. No—I’m not being funny. Well, maybe a little 😜) If you don't have records it's ok, they will probably ask you about your childhood. Just be honest, if the adhd was there, there's lots of questions they can ask about things you probably don't even know were symptoms. So just talk to them, they might want to talk to you an extra time or do more other testing if you don't have the school reports but lots of doctors don't even ask for them. Mine didn't, and I had pretty good grades all through school, and it wasn't a problem after I talked to the doctor and they got to know me.  I feel you. I’m also a woman. Took me until 28 to get prescribed medication and get treated for ADHD.

Go to a different psychiatrist. See a therapist who is listed as treating ADHD. If you can, find one who has a husband or kids with ADHD. You don’t have to see a woman, but I have had much better experience being treated for ADHD by women.

I know how frustrating it is. I can’t imagine dealing with ADHD and kids, and adulting. Get yourself a new psych.  ... literally read that last paragraph word for word to an ADHD specialist. That is pretty classic. I'm so glad to hear that! My apologies. Wait, none of the people you’ve seen about your mental health have even considered testing you for ADHD? You’ve mentioned a disorder by name and they didn’t even want to check on it to ease your mind? I’m legitimately angry about that. If you’ve requested that they look into your symptoms and they didn’t even consider it, that’s just bullshit. Absolute bullshit. 

I’m so sorry you’ve had such bad experiences, both with life and with medical professionals who should be listening to you. I obviously can’t fix anything for you or make it better, but I want you to know that there are people going into psychology and psychiatry that want to change how screwed up and sexist and dismissive the current system is—I’m one of them! I really wish people had better access to professionals who can listen and be supportive and helpful and thorough, and I can’t be that for you, but I’m in school to get into psychology so that I can fight for people like you.

I really hope you can find someone you can see about this who has that kind of perspective about giving real help, and who will actually give you what you need, whether that ends up being a diagnosis (and possibly meds) or not. I've also heard the new thinking is that inattentive symptoms come from a "hyperactive mind" rather than a hyperactive body and that they're basically two sides of the same coin. As ADHD-PI I concur with that It really sounds like you have a handle on the PTSD. It's been a while since I've been tested, so I don't know what tests are done these days, but I remember taking a multiple choice test for one therapist and another sent me to a separate clinic to get tested. They had me sit at a computer screen with a clicker in my hand and the goal was to click every time the number 2 popped on the screen. Initially, it was really easy, but it turned into a mess once my brain detected a pattern because the computer changed the pattern just as I had stopped paying attention. Anyway, that's just one example of the tests that they can do. For someone who has ADD, taking meds makes a night and day difference. I always did well in school and scored in the top percentages on standardized tests. I wasn't diagnosed until I was on my 3rd attempt at college. It took a while to get my life sorted, but now I have a BA and a master's degree and I'm pretty proud of myself. Go and ask for an adhd test. Straight up.  Hugs, best of luck! Yeah I don’t want them to quit either.  I was talking more in the way of like providing evidence that it has been a life long struggle. I was diagnosed at 8. Stopped being treated around 14 and a half by my choice. Went back on meds in my 20s. Because of the old diagnosis I had one appointment and I was back on meds. It’s a weird system  You don't always need the proof, some will take your word for it, some will want hard proof (witnesses, reports, etc.)

If you are lying to achieve an ADHD diagnosis and saying you had childhood symptoms when you didn't, or you're mistaking your own childhood and not allowing "witnesses" to have an input, I feel like you're cooking up a self-diagnosis.

Of course, if you genuinely don't have those items then you don't have those items. You're not barred from a diagnosis for it. Most places for adults > 25 will not ask for them. In general, child psychs will ask for that stuff, adult psychs less-so. A parent filling out a form is common, though. <3 thank you.
