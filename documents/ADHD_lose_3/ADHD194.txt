I am fucking ready Okay people, today will be the day of change. The day I finally stop being a lazy piece of shite.

- I will take a 3h train ride to my college dorms
- I will go to both classes I have today and try to take notes
- On the way back I will stop at Tesco and buy cheap but healthy groceries, my weight loss journey has just begun!
- When I get home, I will make myself a nice dinner and will make the effort to cook
- Then I will go to sleep at a reasonable hour despite having a hard time falling asleep
- In the morning, I have to go to a 7:30AM class. I will not skip.
- I will not forget to set up a phonetics interview so I can get bonus points
- I will play a bit of Fortnite in the evening, because I don't have much studying yet
- I will NOT forget to brush my teeth
- I will wake up a bit earlier and make myself some breakfast

I WILL NOT FAIL THIS TIME. I WILL SET UP A ROUTINE.

I can do it.^pleasegodhavemercy


EDIT: Alrighty people, I survived the train ride with a 40 minute delay. One of the classes got cancelled so I only had to endure one (History of the US). I went to Tesco right after I arrived but realized I am out of money so I bought four apples, bread and cheese. The milk I took with me ended up happily spilling in my luggage meaning I somehow have to wash almost all my clothes now. Which is great. Looks like I won't have any time for Fortnite. Shame. I can't cook because I don't have anything to cook so that's a pass. Well.

^things^could^be^worse You can do it! 

Don’t overwhelm yourself with so many goals that must get done. Pick your top 3 and focus on those, if they get done then do your next ones. 

I’m right there with you though. I’m cooking dinner tomorrow night and I hope I don’t have a meeting after work so I can hit the gym. 

You can do it you badass you! As much as I hate to tarnish the psych you've got, which is awesome!... and probably feels awesome too. 

But as ADHD'ers many of us relate to getting psyched and improving everything just as much as we can relate to being bummed out about how everything has fallen apart. 

I'm 28, 5 years into a 4 year degree, with 2 more years to go ...eep :/  But those last 2 years, will in all likelyhood only take me 2 years (not 5 more).

I testify this to two things which I'll pose as recommendations;

**1)
The Slap: You will fail to keep to your routine.**

You say "I WILL NOT FAIL THIS TIME. I WILL SET UP A ROUTINE." That's good, but make sure you know that the routine is not success, and falling out from your routine is not failure. It's all too easy to unintentionally build a connection between these in our minds that can artificially create negativity that compounds the problem. 

**The ice pack: Planning to fail**

On your 3hr train ride, hypothesise a way that you fail each of these goals. Then write down how you get back on track (keep it short). Post-it note these somewhere.

**2)
The Slap: Rather than fixing the problem, you will plan to fix the problem**

...That pretty much sums it up.

**The Ice Pack: Planning to fail ....again**

For each of those hypothetical 'failings', think about how long it would take you to feel bad about breaking the habit, days/weeks etc. Then write the a number next to that 'failing' I call this my Fuck It! number. If that number is 4, then if you read that note and its been 4 days since you actively made progress toward that goal, then I stop everything and do something/anything towards that goal immediately. 

**Why is this effective for me?**

I think its because no matter how conditioned I am to failing from past negative experiences, I'm less conditioned to failing twice..... and especially three times consecutively. It makes the reality compound faster, and leads to me responding faster. I'm terrible at sticking to plans, but I'm becoming very good and getting back on plan, and no-one around me can tell the difference. Okay yes good! But...that’s an awful lot to accomplish all in one day. Maybe start with just...trying to go to all your classes and take notes for a few days? Then add in the next priority?  >I will play a bit of Fortnite in the evening, because I don't have much studying yet

Don't do this. Half because you don't want to give yourself even an inch of room to slip, half because PUBG is just a better game than Fortnite and I will not apologize for this. And remember: Even if you don't accomplish all of the goals, that doesn't mean you're a failure. Any one you accomplish is a victory, and should be treated as such. Slotting it all into place at once is worth a try for sure. Every negative thing feeds the other negative things, so breaking them all at once might work.

But you need to be ready to forgive yourself if you don't get 100% there, most of the well functioning people you see wouldn't be able to pull off a change this big, so if things start going sour be ready with some priorities about what is most important.  
Then you can come out the other side with a better baseline than you had before. Even if it is only 30% of what you wanted, at least you have a better situation to improve from. You need to have daily recurring alarms in your phone for all of these. 

Good luck!!! ....why are your dorms 3 hours away?  Damn I got anxiety just looking at this list(at 2am)(did I mention I have an 8:00am class?) You are NOT a lazy piece of shit. Saying so implies that it is somehow YOUR FAULT and that you could have just avoided this ever happening. 

Kudos to you for having had enough, though. Best of luck!!  This is me today! Didn't go to class half the week last week and totally screwed up my sleep schedule. Didn't even take my Ritalin like I'm supposed to. Today I am up early and will try to get it together.  Well done. It wasn't your last day being a lazy shite. It was your *First* day being a productive poop. Good job poop. Now go forth and achieve!  YOU FUCKING GOT THIS!!! After 56 minutes, what remains of your dreams I wonder.
 Good luck!  Today will not be that day for me (seeing as I'm browsing reddit at 4am), so I am rooting for you! Yay I believe in you!! Please feel free to update us as you go along. (: I’m trying to finish writing a 5min speech today so you’re not alone trying to change habits here. You got this!! Go get it man! It might help to make some extra food at night so you don't have to put in as much work for breakfast! And depending on what you're making, you can take a few minutes to set up your interview while waiting for things to cook! Good luck! Good luck!!  I beleaf in you !!! God bless your miserable soul. Just curious but does a lack of motivation and will power = ADHD?  How's it going so far?  We're all rooting for you!

Remember if you don't meet all your goals today, you still have made progress and tomorrow is a new day.

You're welcome. How's it going so far? I hope you were able to stick to your plan! You're obviously far from a lazy piece of shit, otherwise you wouldn't care! Good luck and don't worry if you fail to do some of these things, be kind to yourself and leave room for learning what works and what doesn't! Self criticism that's too negative and unreasonable can be very demotivating so be kind to yourself like you're a friend! You wouldn't call a friend a failure or be overly strict. You can do that for yourself too. It works really well.
 Love from the US!! Remember to forgive yourself if anything goes awry!  Go for it! Just don't feel bad if you have to slow down a bit, when I started my self improvement journey I started everything at once and it was too much for me.  You're going to do great today!  I do know that for myself, I start with a really small list so that I can be sure to succeed at it.  A few days of doing that and it becomes easier, then you can add more.  It takes surprisingly little time to get your habits to the point where you're handling lots without struggling.  Just remember that not doing all of them isn't failing, give yourself permission to not be perfect. Alright, this helped me tremendously. 

Make yourself a little checklist for the month. So each day you have items like

- wake up by XX o'clock
- brush and floss
- get to all classes
- make my own, healthy (but tasty) dinner
- exercise
- clean or organize
- sleep by XX o'clock

Then, each day, week, and month you can score yourself. Each day gets a X/7 score, each week a X/49 score, etc. 

Having a visual representation has helped me so damn much. It's something to take pride in. Routines seem so damned stupid (to my adhd-riddled mind) but damn it if it doesn't feel amazing to achieve those small, daily steps.

Best of luck, friend! >my weight loss journey has just begun!

So here is a tip for that. All you have to do is eat less. I can lose weight by doing no exercise, yet managing my caloric intake.

We burn vastly more calories by just staying alive than we ever will by exercising. So don't aim to lose weight via exercise, it won't happen.

That said, exercise is good. It makes you healthy. It will not make you a healthy weight though.

Food management = weight management.

Exercise = physical health maintenance.

This is important to know because if you set out to lose weight via exercise and you don't manage your calories, you're not going to lose weight and you'll end up being upset that all your hard work hasn't paid off and then you'll stop exercising and nothing will have changed. Beautiful. Remember to never fill out your agenda in pen.  >The day I finally stop being a lazy piece of shite.

If you actually do have ADHD, you're not lazy. You have a genuine disability. You wouldn't call someone with one leg a lazy piece of shite, would you?

In fact, you probably work harder than most other people on a lot of things, just to barely keep up with them. Congratulations. That would have been enough to piss me off and not do anything for a while. And lose all motivation  You can do it!! I failed many times, medication eventually got me where I wanted to be, not any external motivation. Got my first A in a hardcore college test Friday, it feels amazing.  Effort is the most important thing. Keep telling yourself you did good and things just weren't in your control.  Thank you for reminding me to brush my teeth!

And good luck today! I know you can do it! Spinach is super versatile and healthy.  Would recommend. I’m having a day like this. Set my alarm 1/2 hour early so I can eat breakfast work out pack lunch poop and shower. I only have 20 mins left to eat poop and shower cause I decided to wash the windows. Fuck shit fuck  This just blew my fucking mind because it's almost identical to the notes and lists I write myself every day even though I didn't pick it up from anyone else I feel like I am not capable of focusing on a few goals. I will try a rapid change. I can make it. Just wanted to thank you for the comment after all this time :D I wanted to come back but forgot. I read it and do still base things on it. Sorry! Because the city I live in is 200km away from where I study. I was home for the weekend. Currently still on the train Well I stubbed my toe in the meantime. Does that count? No, but they are among the most common symptoms. Studies into will power have shown that there is a finite amount each day and exercising it  wears you out mentally. That is one of the reasons people are more likely to be "lazy" or cave to something when they are tired/stressed/end of the day.

I have found that starting ADHD meds hasn't increased my motivation or will power, but each action seems take less mental energy to accomplish, leaving me with the ability to do more and persevere more easily. Still an effort, but a smaller one. I'm also not as easily distracted, so I'm wasting less energy on trying to get back on task or remembering where I was in the task before I got distracted.  No. No, only a small part of it. The entire range of executive function is a problem, along side attention, memory, emotional problems, addictive tendencies, etc. You do you! You can do it!!! Oh okay, I was thinking that this was some daily commute thing and I was really confused.  Just trying to see which of 9 points has fallen away so far. :-)
