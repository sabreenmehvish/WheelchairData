[US] Healthcare.gov open enrollment Nov 1-Dec 15. Sign up before you forget! Just a reminder to everyone in the US that open enrollment started today and goes through December 15 for coverage starting January 1, 2018.

If you do not have employer/parent-based coverage then it is in your interest to look into this during open enrollment or be left without coverage until the next open enrollment period (if there will be one....) in one year for coverage starting in 2019.

You generally cannot sign up for insurance outside of this time unless you have a qualifying event (losing coverage, new baby, moving out of an area, etc.) or you are trying to qualify for Medicaid (low income) or Medicare (65+/SSDI/ESRD), so please make all your reminders _before_ December to look into it.

# https://www.healthcare.gov/ is the place to go to find out more information.

## https://localhelp.healthcare.gov/ can help you find your local exchange and local places to ask questions and receive free assistance in enrolling in a plan.

You can also find a local insurance agent to talk to :) Unless they work specifically for one company (a "captive" agent) the vast majority tend to work on commission so you end up paying nothing directly for their services. See more here in /u/baconwrappedpikachu's comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7a51iu/us_healthcaregov_open_enrollment_nov_1dec_15_sign/dpjegft/ So... December 15th at 11:53pm I'll start my application.  I'm very sorry for you folks. I know I'm very privileged to be born a dutch citizen. It must be so hard to have to worry about money for things like medical bills and education. Health and knowledge should be free for everyone in the world.  Licensed Insurance Agent here! I am not certified to write marketplace plans, and I work mainly with small businesses, but the majority of my clients are floored when they find out that they don't pay anything to work with an agent.  
  
I would *highly* suggest going through an agent to get your plan because if they are on the ball, it can be extremely helpful to have someone else helping you stay on target as far as deadlines and understanding your coverage goes. Insurance is confusing and intimidating (and horrible), and having someone who is able to explain those things can make a huge difference!  
  
Good luck out there, y'all! Before I forget? That's cute. :P 

Kidding!  if work offers insurance, but i find it to be way far out of my budget, can i apply? i filled it out but it's too expensive so i guess ill just continue to suffer oh well Thanks for posting this. I'm about to get fired from my job for missing a god damn training day and getting SIX POINTS, SIX DAYS worth of late points, for missing a fucking 5 hour training day, which is basically not much more different than new-hire orientation, and I've been casino security for over a year now. I've already learned everything or I wouldn't have been working there as long....

The funny thing is, I was calling around desperately trying to find a god damn psychiatrist who would take me and my casino-given insurance during the hours I forgot I was supposed to come in early for the training before my actual shift. I finally secured an appointment earlier today for this Thursday.... I hope they don't fire me tomorrow, I've been SPI'D since Monday, awaiting a final decision by my department.

I haven't been on Ritalin in 7 years, and I was THIS FUCKING CLOSE to getting back on, after watching all of these videos by this dude here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPFmKu2S5XY I was no longer afraid of trying medication again because he spoke so clearly about everything, and everything he said about ADHD was true, and everything he said about the medication... it just all makes sense now, and I'm ready for medical treatment again... And now I'm about to get fired most likely, because casinos don't give a fuck about you at all and the SPI is just a delay until they get to actually fire people.... Fuck I hope I get to at least get my first prescription before they fire me, so I can at least have a better chance of nailing another job in between doing my rideshare job. Maybe my brain powers will activate, I'll remember all the trig and calculus I learned in high school, I'll be able to master programming in a month and finish my smartphone game and everything will be all right.... Huhh.... stressing out here, I just started financing a car and now I gotta look for a job again, starting off with zero health benefits again.

I hope if I get fired, that I can quickly get health insurance again through that government site you posted above. If I don't get to get medicated again very soon.... I don't wanna say I'm gonna kill myself, but I'm gonna wish I was dead every single day, wasting my life away again, because it gets impossibly painful and just impossible in general to retain most of the words I read and most of the steps I do, without thousands of repetitions. I want to be a biomedical engineer, not a fucking mediocre security guard or something stupid.... I don't want to be one of those people who live with ADHD, like that idiot that did the TED talk about how he tried everything and decided to become a fucking broadway theater prop artist or something... Is that really the potential of someone with ADHD without meds?

Just sharing my tornado of thoughts here.

I hope to God I don't lose my job and health insurance, but thank god you posted this, so that I have a smidgen of hope again after being fired and possibly losing my fucking car all over again.  Thanks for the info and your words of encouragement. I’ll find out in a few hours if I’m keeping my job. Don't know if this is the right place for this, but I am enrolled in Masshealth and am trying to find ADD coaches/counselors/therapist in the greater Boston area that accept Masshealth. Can anyone help me? I can't afford any of their plans that cover vyvanse, so if i elect for one, i'll be paying hundreds a month for a plan that doesn't cover my hundreds in medication. 

my vyv is 218/mo with coupon.

cheapest policies available to me are in the $2-300 range, but don't cover my vyvanse.

the ones that do, are $400+

all monthly.


I can't afford this shit.  [removed] Does anyone know how long it takes to find out if you qualify for coverage?
 I did it this week! I put it on my must get done list and did it! I didn't even wait till the last minute! Ironic to see this as top post. I'm going through a bit of an insurance crisis at the moment. Just switched jobs and lost coverage Dec 1. New coverage doesn't start until January (at least). Completely forgot about my medication which I will be needing a refill of in about a week. I'm on strattera and that shit costs like $300+. I'm looking at coupons online to see what I can do to lower the cost.  I've been really confused on this...if I know I'm losing coverage next month (quitting my job in the first week of January), should I apply for open enrollment BEFORE I lose my job, or after? I have to check with HR but I assume I will lose coverage the day I quit my job. YAAAAAAAAAAY HEALTHCARE ಠ_ಠ

I want to laugh but medical bills are responsible for as much as two thirds of personal bankruptcies in the US. Do whatever it takes to make sure you are more than done with your application, ahead of time, so you don't get screwed over. It's a truly mixed bag of experiences in the US. We have some great world-class options available to us, but access to it is all over the map. We've made some good changes in the direction towards access for all, but still have a ways to go - clearly it has failed some folks (like multiple commenters here) and is still a tricky, expensive, frustrating thing to navigate...

 Knowing me, I'd still find a way to worry about it even if someone else was paying it for me.  I regret that I do not have the ability to sticky your comment up, but I will edit my post to reflect this. I was trying to imply that agents don't cost anything, but did not make it explicit. How does one find these agents locally? How does one find these agents locally? You can usually apply regardless of what your employer offers. The question is generally whether or not you'll qualify for savings on the marketplace plans. 

I don't know the exact details, but I believe the only way you get marketplace savings is if your work insurance plan is above a certain % of your income _and_ if they don't meet the minimum standard. This is highly unlikely because if your employer is offering a plan at all, they're typically required to offer that kind of plan, one way or another.

Healthcare.gov should talk more about this in detail, and you can always ask an insurance agent for help.

The penalty for not having insurance of any kind is also something you should take into account when considering that this seems out of budget. Yeah a lot of issues with plan availability and cost for many folks :(

Please tread carefully with not having any coverage though, and investigate other options you may have (low income, school-based, talk to an agent, etc.). You may be charged a penalty that may be in the thousands of dollars come tax time if you have no insurance coverage. Hey hey oh man :( 

I really hope your job is safe, but in the event it isn't, a certain amount of time around a job/insurance loss is a special enrollment period so you don't have to worry about open enrollment deadlines - you can usually get insurance starting sooner too (e.g. December 2017 rather than January 2018). With low income you can also qualify for Medicaid at any time of the year. You also (if this is within-budget) can pay cash for appointments and get a discount card (like on goodrx.com) or manufacturer coupon for low copays on meds without insurance.

Also check into financial hardship assistance for your car loan if you do end up jobless.

Let me tell you I understand a surprising amount of the pain though - I was a software engineer and I was looking into grad school options for biomedical engineering but taking a break for a new babby and not being on meds regularly (issues breastfeeding...) is wrecking me in some ways but in other ways it's not the worst thing ever (says the years of therapy/CBT/actively trying non-med treatment options...). Nothing wrong with being a broadway artist or not being on meds though, or being in a job you don't like right now but aspiring to more. You gotta try to push for what you want to do with your life, the sad thing is if you had nothing to work towards. You have a bunch of choices even with the worst case scenario. You will be okay and I know you can pull through regardless! You could make a new post about it, but without knowing much about Masshealth: I think you should find a general list of ADHD providers and then call up the offices and double check that they'd accept it - would be more accurate than many listings, even. Yeah some of the plans for 2018 are pretty atrocious :(

Please talk to an agent if you haven't already, though, as they may be able to find you a better deal with off-marketplace plans or other options.

I assume that's the mfg coupon you're using - I really hope they have a new one coming for 2018 since vyvanse is so expensive :|

One more thing though, although I am not an insurance agent: the penalty for not having health insurance can add up pretty fast if you are not exempt from it. Please make sure you do that math (plus the math of not having coverage) before absolutely deciding to forego insurance. In some cases it may not make sense to try to save $x when you end up paying more than $x out of your tax refund (or added to your tax bill). Hey I'm sorry that happened to you :( Many insurers seem to be quite nervous and a lot of them are exiting markets or raising premiums as a result of the confusion right now.

However, over 80% of the US population will be able to get a 2018 plan that costs $75/month or less. There is also a significant population that would otherwise have little to no insurance without the ACA - including many people in this subreddit, due to ADHD being a preexisting condition. We the mods highly recommend looking into all options available to you, hence the reminder.

As a small business owner I especially know your pain, but look into the SHOP marketplace and see if you can look into something that way. You qualify for that marketplace if you have only one FT-equivalent employee that is not an owner or family member. I would also recommend seeing an insurance agent for your business needs that can talk to you about your options. I think it depends by state and what you're applying for (like I suspect Medicaid is different from normal plans), but if you don't hear back within a couple weeks you should check in on your application. Congrats! :D Damn!

The job switch is a special enrollment period but the special enrollment doesn't usually take place until the following month, so that probably won't help you now.

Do you have COBRA? It is a good backup plan in case you run into more needs this month before new coverage kicks in. It is (afaik) retroactive, so you don't actually have to choose it and pay for it unless you really need to.

Check goodrx.com for strattera coupons. I see the average price as $100ish, which isn't great but it's better than $300. Ummm the best people to talk to would be HR and an insurance agent. Do talk to the agent ASAP, please, in case it is a problem. Maybe hold off on HR unless they know you're leaving already. But...

From my layperson perspective:

* It's not obvious you lose coverage the day you quit - from my experience the company may have already paid premiums for that month so your coverage ends at the end of the month. But I have seen some folks lose coverage the day they quit. (But now that I think about it, don't remember if it was the end of the month...)
* You likely will have COBRA available to you as a stopgap measure regardless.
* If you currently have job-based coverage that disqualifies you from marketplace subsidies, you may run into issues on that front when signing up during open enrollment.  You're totally right, just couldn't resist the procrastination joke. Fortunately, I'm covered through work. Bingo. Dutch and not in the best position financially at the moment. Worried like crazy all the time. Probably have no reason to, but I keep procrastinating getting my finances in order and figuring out what I'm entitled to. So stupid! :/ Hey, that's perfect! Thank you! If you're going through the marketplace, there should be a link at that website that will connect you to local agents. I've heard good things about several other local agents that work through healthmarkets.com - not sure if that's the case for everywhere, but we've had good luck with them. Your 80% number is not true. 80% of the people who went to the exchange received a subsidy, nothing about what they are paying has been released. Only 8.6% of Americans now have health insurance that didn't have it before. Taxes were raised $883 billion. For people who have worked hard our whole lives to beat the odds and make over $48,000/year, it has only made our lives harder. Luckily Obamacare acknowledges that it is unaffordable in our area so we are exempt from paying the tax penalties. Premiums have gone up 28% since it passed. In 2018 insurance companies are expecting that number to be 40%. All this system has done is penalize people who work hard simple as that. Thanks! I'm making a trip to the pharmacy tomorrow to try those coupons. Crazy how expensive it is. What really sucks is that I just need like two weeks worth of the stuff before Jan 1. And I really don't want  to go without it when I'm just starting the new job. 

I do have cobra but 1 month is crazy...$700.  Thanks so much for your reply. I'll get on it on Monday and call my insurance. COBRA ends ups being like 4x what you paid before.  It's like your opportunity to continue health coverage....if you can afford it.
 I don't want to get into an argument about health policy here. But to address your point about me being a liar so it doesn't discourage people reading this that otherwise would benefit:

https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-marketplace-premiums-affordable/

> According to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services’ policy division, 80 percent of HealthCare.gov enrollees will be able to purchase a plan for $75 or less per month.

The implication is that yes, they are getting a subsidy, but also that $75 or less is _explicitly_ their share of the premium. You can ask for a two week prescription and it might make it somewhat cheaper. The only problem is, you may not be able to get a fill that fast - depending on insurance and if they want prior auth and more (or even a dr visit) it may take a little time until you can get a fill with the new insurance.

COBRA is very expensive for sure, I'm just saying if shit hits the fan with $$$$$$ medical bills between now and January 1, you have a small safety net there if that is an option.  Well, yeah. The nice thing about COBRA though is (afaik) it's retroactive. Meaning, let's say you quit your job today. New job and new coverage won't start until January 2018. You get into an accident next week and you end up in the hospital. You can still file for COBRA coverage during your election period (of at least 60 days) and pay your $$$ premium in order to avoid paying $$$$$ bills as a noninsured patient.

It's not perfect, but it's an option, especially if you have any kind of weird gap - including special enrollment not starting until the first day of the month _after_ you select a plan on the marketplace. I stand corrected thanks for that. I guess I need a pay cut :-) Hey so I ended up getting a refill of only 10 pills kind of like you suggested. I wasn't aware that I can break up my refills into smaller buckets but the pharmacist helped me with that. The coupon I found online didn't cover me but luckily the pharmacist input a code she knew and reduced the cost. So I left with minimal damage to my bank account. 

Also, as I was standing in line I realized the significance of what you said about COBRA being retroactive. So if i break my leg tomorrow, I'm not screwed after all. Thanks for your help.  That's good news! I hope come January 1 you'll have an easy fill with the new insurance.

Yeah, that's what I'm getting at :) Keep the COBRA election forms around until they expire (60+ days usually) just in case.
