How do you not lose sun glasses? Title* They're always on my head, or in my car. No exceptions. Multiple Pairs.

And I never take them off. I'll be going to sleep at the end of the day and find a pair still on top of my head (not over my eyes, ob) I keep them in my purse, and a sunglasses case so they dont break. Because I break them instead lol

... but seriously. If you manage to figure this one out please let me know. I never buy SG's that cost more than $20 because I know full well that they won't last more than a month at best.  Take your mother's 20 year old Christian Dior sunglasses on a permanent loan. The crippling fear of losing them keeps me from losing them.

Otherwise, I genuinely do not know, as I'm on my umpteenth pair of cheapies. Don't wear them Pair in my car that stays there. Another pair that is either on my face, on my shirt, or right beside where I put my wallet and keys. I’m losing all of none haha Zip pockets.  Effort. Sheer effort (I have forced myself to learn a routine to check all the stuff I need to take with me everytime I leave somewhere: wallet, keys, phone, sunglasses). That kinda helps but it takes an effort.

(also: mine are prescription glasses so losing them would be an expensive feat) 

Another thing: if I go somewhere where my effort could be impaired (e.g. drinking at a bar) I try to leave as much stuff at home. Bringing less means less chance to lose/forget something. It still happens though. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  I never buy sunglasses that cost more than $5, so it doesn't matter. They stay on my head at all times if they aren't on my face, or get put in a bin by the door very first thing when I get home,along with my keys, wallet, water bottle, pack of smokes, and bottle of adderal. Leaving for work without or losing any of those things basically guarantees a bad day, so all of them are either on my person or in that bin at all times, no exceptions.

 I had a coworker with adhd who was also sensitive to light, he had a pair that was meant to stay on him at all times(but often didn't), 2 sets in his work vehicle, 2 sets in his personal vehicle, one that stayed in his tool box, and several scattered around his house. If one got lost he would replace it that same day. I’ve lost every pair of sun glasses I’ve ever had
